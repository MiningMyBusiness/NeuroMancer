Adult neurogenesis emerges as a tremendous form of plasticity with the continuous
addition and loss of neurons in the adult brain. It is unclear how preexisting
adult circuits generated during development are capable of modifying existing
connections to accommodate the thousands of new synapses formed and exchanged
each day. Here we first make parallels with sensory deprivation studies and its
ability to induce preexisting non-neurogenic adult circuits to undergo massive
reorganization. We then review recent studies that show high structural and
synaptic plasticity in circuits directly connected to adult-born neurons.
Finally, we propose future directions in the field to decipher how host circuits 
can accommodate new neuron integration and to determine the impact of adult
neurogenesis on global brain plasticity.

Axon regeneration and neuronal tissue repair varies across animal lineages as
well as in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. While the
peripheral nervous system retains the ability to self-repair, the majority of
axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to reactivate
intrinsic growth programs after injury. Recent findings, however, suggest that
long-distance axon regeneration, neuronal circuit assembly and recovery of
functions in the adult mammalian CNS are possible. Here, we discuss our current
knowledge of the cell signaling pathways and networks controlling axon
regeneration. In addition, we outline a number of combinatorial strategies that
include among others microtubule-based treatments to foster regeneration and
functional connectivity after CNS trauma.

The neural connectome is a critical determinant of brain function. Circuits of
precisely wired neurons, and the features of transmission at the synapses
connecting them, are thought to dictate information processing in the brain.
While recent technological advances now allow to define the anatomical and
functional neural connectome at unprecedented resolution, the elucidation of the 
molecular mechanisms that establish the precise patterns of connectivity and the 
functional characteristics of synapses has remained challenging. Here, we
describe the power and limitations of genetic approaches in the analysis of
mechanisms that control synaptic connectivity and function, and discuss how
recent methodological developments in proteomics might be used to elucidate the
molecular synaptic connectome that is at the basis of the neural connectome.

Different aspects of learning, memory, and cognition are regulated by epigenetic 
mechanisms such as covalent DNA modifications and histone post-translational
modifications. More recently, the modulation of chromatin architecture and
nuclear organization is emerging as a key factor in dynamic transcriptional
regulation of the post-mitotic neuron. For instance, neuronal activity induces
relocalization of gene loci to 'transcription factories', and specific
enhancer-promoter looping contacts allow for precise transcriptional regulation. 
Moreover, neuronal activity-dependent DNA double-strand break formation in the
promoter of immediate early genes appears to overcome topological constraints on 
transcription. Together, these findings point to a critical role for genome
topology in integrating dynamic environmental signals to define precise
spatiotemporal gene expression programs supporting cognitive processes.

Proneural proteins, which include Ascl1, Atoh1 and Neurogenins épinière in
vertebrates and Achaete-Scute proteins and Atonal in Drosophila, are expressed in
the developing nervous system throughout the animal kingdom and have an essential
and well-characterised role in specifying the neural identity of progenitors. New
properties and additional roles of these factors have emerged in recent years,
including the regulation of stem cell proliferation and the capacity to reprogram
many types of cells into neurons. This review will focus on these recent
findings. The review will also discuss the mechanisms that allow proneural
proteins to induce the transcription of their target genes in different chromatin
contexts and the phosphorylation events and other post-transcriptional mechanisms
that regulate the proneural proteins themselves.

Inhibitory circuits are essential for brain function. Our understanding of their 
synaptic organization has advanced extensively with the identification and
classification of an impressive variety of neuron groups, receptor types, and
patterns of connectivity. However, the conceptual discussion regarding the role
of in neural circuits still revolves around the idea that its primary role is to 
regulate circuit excitability. Here, I will focus on recent findings from
cortical circuits and argue that inhibitory circuits are central to the
integration of incoming inputs and can promote sophisticated fine-scale control
of local circuits. I propose that inhibitory circuits should not be viewed so
much as brakes on principal neurons activity, but as primary contributors to a
variety of neural network functions.

Synaptic inhibition is a critical regulator of neuronal excitability, and in the 
mature brain the majority of synaptic inhibition is mediated by Cl(-)-permeable
GABAA receptors. Unlike other physiologically relevant ions, Cl(-) is dynamically
regulated, and alterations in the Cl(-) gradient can have significant impact on
neuronal excitability. Due to changes in the neuronal Cl(-) concentration,
GABAergic transmission can bidirectionally regulate the induction of excitatory
synaptic plasticity and gate the closing of the critical period for monocular
deprivation in visual cortex. GABAergic circuitry can also provide a powerful
restraining mechanism for the spread of excitation, however Cl(-) extrusion
mechanisms can become overwhelmed and GABA can paradoxically contribute to
pathological excitation such as the propagation of seizure activity.

During development a limited number of progenitors generate diverse cell types
that comprise the nervous system. Neuronal diversity, which arises largely at the
level of neural stem cells, is critical for brain function. Often these cells
exhibit temporal patterning: they sequentially produce neurons of distinct cell
fates as a consequence of intrinsic and/or extrinsic cues. Here, we review recent
advances in temporal patterning during neuronal specification, focusing on
conserved players and mechanisms in invertebrate and vertebrate models. These
studies underscore temporal patterning as an evolutionarily conserved strategy to
generate neuronal diversity. Understanding the general principles governing
temporal patterning and the molecular players involved will improve our ability
to direct neural progenitors towards specific neuronal fates for brain repair.

Neural stem cells go through a sequence of timely regulated gene expression and
pattern of division mode to generate diverse neurons during brain development.
During vertebrate cerebral cortex development, neural stem cells begin with
proliferative symmetric divisions, subsequently undergo neurogenic asymmetric
divisions, and finally gliogenic divisions. In this review, we explore the
relationship between stem cell versus neural fate specification and the division 
mode. Specifically, we discuss recent findings on the mechanisms of asymmetric
divisions, division mode, and developmental progression of neural progenitor
identity.

Adult somatic stem cells are generally defined as cells with the ability to
differentiate into multiple different lineages and to self-renew during long
periods of time. These features were long presumed to be represented in one
single tissue-specific stem cell. Recent development of single-cell technologies 
reveals the existence of diversity in fate and activation state of somatic stem
cells within the blood, skin and intestinal compartments [1] but also in the
adult brain. Here we review how recent advances have expanded our view of neural 
stem cells (NSCs) as a diverse pool of cells and how the specialized
microenvironment in which they reside acts to maintain this diversity. In
addition, we discuss the plasticity of the system in the injured brain.

The evolution of the human brain has been characterized by an increase in the
size of the neocortex. Underlying this expansion is a significant increase in the
number of neurons produced by neural stem cells during early stages of cortical
development. Here we highlight recent advances in our understating of these cell 
populations, consisting of ventricular radial glia and outer radial glia. We
highlight how gene expression studies have identified molecular signatures for
radial glial cell populations and outline what has been learned about the
mechanisms underlying the characteristic mode of division observed in outer
radial glia cells, mitotic somal translocation. Understanding the significance of
this behavior may help us explain human cortical expansion and further elucidate 
neurodevelopmental diseases.

In the vertebrate nervous system, the fast conduction of action potentials is
potentiated by the myelin sheath, a multi-lamellar, lipid-rich structure that
also provides vital trophic and metabolic support to axons. Myelin is elaborated 
by the plasma membrane of specialized glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the
central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous
system (PNS). The diseases that result from damage to myelin or glia, including
multiple sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, underscore the importance of 
these cells for human health. Therefore, an understanding of glial development
and myelination is crucial in addressing the etiology of demyelinating diseases
and developing patient therapies. In this review, we discuss new insights into
the roles of mechanotransduction and cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as
activity dependent myelination and axonal maintenance by glia. Together, these
discoveries advance our knowledge of myelin and glia in nervous system health and
plasticity throughout life.

Combining information from multiple senses creates robust percepts, speeds up
responses, enhances learning, and improves detection, discrimination, and
recognition. In this review, I discuss computational models and principles that
provide insight into how this process of multisensory integration occurs at the
behavioral and neural level. My initial focus is on drift-diffusion and Bayesian 
models that can predict behavior in multisensory contexts. I then highlight how
recent neurophysiological and perturbation experiments provide evidence for a
distributed redundant network for multisensory integration. I also emphasize
studies which show that task-relevant variables in multisensory contexts are
distributed in heterogeneous neural populations. Finally, I describe
dimensionality reduction methods and recurrent neural network models that may
help decipher heterogeneous neural populations involved in multisensory
integration.

The generation of neurons in the developing and adult mammalian brain by neural
stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) depends on a tight control of NSPC activity and
neuronal differentiation that is regulated by a plethora of intrinsic and
extrinsic molecular cues. Besides well-studied morphogenic signaling pathways and
transcriptional codes that govern the distinct developmental steps from the
dividing NSPC to a functional neuron, a critical role of cellular metabolism to
determine the functional properties of NSPCs and newborn neurons has been
recently identified. Here, we review advances in our understanding of how
metabolism affects NSPC behavior and subsequent neuronal differentiation and
suggest how metabolism may serve as a common signal integrator to ensure
life-long addition of new neurons in the mammalian brain.

Avoiding or escaping a predator is arguably one of the most important functions
of a prey's brain, hence of most animals' brains. Studies on fear conditioning
have greatly advanced our understanding of the circuits that regulate learned
defensive behaviours. However, animals possess a multitude of threat detection
mechanisms, from hardwired circuits that ensure innate responses to predator
cues, to the use of social information. Surprisingly, only more recently have
these circuits captured the attention of a wider range of researchers working on 
different species and behavioural paradigms. These have shed new light into the
mechanisms of threat detection revealing conservation of the kinds of cues
animals use and of its underlying detection circuits across vertebrates. As most 
of these studies focus on single cues, we argue for the need to study
multisensory integration, a process that we believe is determinant for the prey's
defence responses.

Here we review recent studies of the cortical circuits subserving the control of 
posture and movement. This topic is addressed from neurophysiological and
evolutionary perspectives describing recent advancements achieved through
experimental studies in humans and non-human primates. We also describe current
debates and controversies concerning motor mapping within the motor cortex and
the different computational approaches aimed at resolving the mystery around
motor representations and computations. In recent years there is growing interest
in the possibly modular organization of motor representations and dynamical
processes and the potential of such studies to provide new clues into motor
information processing. Hence this review focuses on motor modularity,
highlighting the new research directions inspired by empirical findings and
theoretical models developed within the last several years.

Miniature insects can be as small as a few hundred micrometres in size, making
them among the smallest metazoan animals ever described. Yet, even at these
length scales, they display remarkably sophisticated flight behaviours. For
flight at such low Reynolds numbers, miniature insects have evolved biomechanical
and neural adaptations that push the boundaries of what is possible in the realm 
of physics and neurobiology of flight. After several decades of relative
dormancy, this question has recently been revisited by researchers working in
diverse areas ranging from systematics and neurobiology to dispersal behaviours. 
In this review, I cover recent findings in this area, and point towards the many 
open questions that still remain unanswered.

Neural circuits mediating visually evoked escape behaviors are promising systems 
in which to dissect the neural basis of behavior. Behavioral responses to
predator-like looming stimuli, and their underlying neural computations, are
remarkably similar across species. Recently, genetic tools have been applied in
this classical paradigm, revealing novel non-cortical pathways that connect loom 
processing to defensive behaviors in mammals and demonstrating that loom encoding
models from locusts also fit vertebrate neural responses. In both invertebrates
and vertebrates, relative spike-timing in descending pathways is a mechanism for 
escape behavior choice. Current findings suggest that experimentally tractable
systems, such as Drosophila, may be applicable models for sensorimotor processing
and persistent states in higher organisms.

Central pattern generators are subject to modulation by peptides, allowing for
flexibility in patterned output. Current techniques used to characterize peptides
include mass spectrometry and transcriptomics. In recent years, hundreds of
neuropeptides have been sequenced from crustaceans; mass spectrometry has been
used to identify peptides and to determine their levels and locations, setting
the stage for comparative studies investigating the physiological roles of
peptides. Such studies suggest that there is some evolutionary conservation of
function, but also divergence of function even within a species. With current
baseline data, it should be possible to begin using comparative approaches to ask
fundamental questions about why peptides are encoded the way that they are and
how this affects nervous system function.

Over one billion people worldwide are infected with parasitic nematodes. Many
parasitic nematodes actively search for hosts to infect using volatile chemical
cues, so understanding the olfactory signals that drive host seeking may
elucidate new pathways for preventing infections. The free-living nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model for parasitic nematodes: because
sensory neuroanatomy is conserved across nematode species, an understanding of
the microcircuits that mediate olfaction in C. elegans may inform studies of
olfaction in parasitic nematodes. Here we review circuit mechanisms that allow C.
elegans to respond to odorants, gases, and pheromones. We also highlight work on 
the olfactory behaviors of parasitic nematodes that lays the groundwork for
future studies of their olfactory microcircuits.

Electrical and chemical signaling within and between neurons consumes energy.
Recent studies have sought to refine our understanding of the processes that
consume energy and their relationship to information processing by coupling
experiments with computational models and energy budgets. These studies have
produced insights into both how neurons and neural circuits function, and why
they evolved to function in the way they do.

Motion vision provides important cues for many tasks. Flying insects, for
example, may pursue small, fast moving targets for mating or feeding purposes,
even when these are detected against self-generated optic flow. Since insects are
small, with size-constrained eyes and brains, they have evolved to optimize their
optical, neural and behavioral target visualization solutions. Indeed, even if
evolutionarily distant insects display different pursuit strategies, target
neuron physiology is strikingly similar. Furthermore, the coarse spatial
resolution of the insect compound eye might actually be beneficial when it comes 
to detection of moving targets. In conclusion, tiny insects show higher than
expected performance in target visualization tasks.

Motion vision originated during the Cambrian explosion more than 500 million
years ago, likely triggered by the race for earliest detection between preys and 
predators. To successfully evade a predator's attack a prey must react quickly
and reliably, which imposes a common constrain to the implementation of escape
responses among different species. Thus, neural circuits subserving fast escape
responses are usually straightforward and contain giant neurons. This review
summarizes knowledge about a small group of motion-sensitive giant neurons
thought to be central in guiding the escape performance of crabs to visual
stimuli. The flexibility of the escape behavior contrasts with the stiffness of
the optomotor response, indicating a task-dependent early segregation of visual
pathways.

Adapting behavior to thermal cues is essential for animal growth and survival.
Indeed, each and every biological and biochemical process is profoundly affected 
by temperature and its extremes can cause irreversible damage. Hence, animals
have developed thermotransduction mechanisms to detect and encode thermal
information in the nervous system and acclimation mechanisms to finely tune their
response over different timescales. While temperature-gated TRP channels are the 
best described class of temperature sensors, recent studies highlight many new
candidates, including ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Here, we review
recent findings in vertebrate and invertebrate models, which highlight and
substantiate the role of new candidate molecular thermometers and reveal
intracellular signaling mechanisms implicated in thermal acclimation at the
behavioral and cellular levels.

Colour vision-the ability to discriminate spectral differences irrespective of
variations in intensity-has two basic requirements: (1) photoreceptors with
different spectral sensitivities, and (2) neural comparison of signals from these
photoreceptors. Major progress has been made understanding the evolution of the
basic stages of colour vision-opsin pigments, screening pigments, and the first
neurons coding chromatic opponency, and similarities between mammals and insects 
point to general mechanisms. However, much work is still needed to unravel full
colour pathways in various animals. While primates may have brain regions
entirely dedicated to colour coding, animals with small brains, such as insects, 
likely combine colour information directly in parallel multisensory pathways
controlling various behaviours.

Intercellular interactions in the nervous system are mediated by two types of
dedicated structural arrangements: electrical and chemical synapses. Several
characteristics distinguish these two mechanisms of communication, such as speed,
reliability and the fact that electrical synapses are, potentially,
bidirectional. Given these properties, electrical synapses can subserve, in
addition to synchrony, three main interrelated network functions: signal
amplification, noise reduction and/or coincidence detection. Specific network
motifs in sensory and motor systems of invertebrates and vertebrates illustrate
how signal transmission through electrical junctions contributes to a complex
processing of information.

To feed or not to feed is a dilemma faced by every animal. The sense of taste is 
fundamental to the control of food intake. It permits recognition of nutrients,
the rejection of toxins, and provides feedback for the coordination of feeding.
The suboesophageal zone of the insect brain uses taste information to orchestrate
the motor programs responsible for mouthparts coordination during feeding.
Discovering the structure of the relevant neural circuits is a work in progress.

Echolocating bats exhibit accurate three-dimensional (3D) auditory localization
to avoid obstacles and intercept prey. The bat achieves high spatial resolution
through a biological sonar system. Key features of the bat's sonar system are (1)
high frequency, directional echolocation signals; (2) high frequency hearing; (3)
mobile ears; and (4) measurement of distance from the time delay between sonar
emission and echo reception. The bat's sonar receiver is a standard mammalian
auditory system that computes azimuth from inter-aural differences and elevation 
from spectral filtering by the ear [1-3]. Target range is computed from echo
arrival time [4,5], and the bat auditory system contains neurons that show echo
delay-tuned responses to pulse-echo pairs [6]. Ultimately, information about
sound source azimuth, elevation and range converge to create a unified
representation of 3D space.

The neurogenic heartbeat of certain invertebrates has long been studied both as a
way of understanding how automatic functions are regulated and for how neuronal
networks generate the inherent rhythmic activity that controls and coordinates
this vital function. This review focuses on the heartbeat of decapod crustaceans 
and hirudinid leeches, which remain important experimental systems for the
exploration of central pattern generator networks, their properties, network and 
cellular mechanisms, modulation, and how animal-to-animal variation in neuronal
and network properties are managed to produce functional output.

Often distinct elements serve similar functions within a network. However, it is 
unclear whether this network degeneracy is beneficial, or merely a reflection of 
tighter regulation of overall network performance relative to individual neuronal
properties. We review circumstances where data strongly suggest that degeneracy
is beneficial in that it makes network function more robust. Importantly, network
degeneracy is likely to have functional consequences that are not widely
appreciated. This is likely to be true when network activity is configured by
modulators with persistent actions, and the history of network activity
potentially impacts subsequent functioning. Data suggest that degeneracy in this 
context may be important for the creation of latent memories, and for
state-dependent task switching.

Rhythmicity is critical for the generation of rhythmic behaviors and higher brain
functions. This review discusses common mechanisms of rhythm generation,
including the role of synaptic inhibition and excitation, with a focus on the
mammalian respiratory network. This network generates three phases of breathing
and is highly integrated with brain regions associated with numerous
non-ventilatory behaviors. We hypothesize that during evolution multiple
rhythmogenic microcircuits were recruited to accommodate the generation of each
breathing phase. While these microcircuits relied primarily on excitatory
mechanisms, synaptic inhibition became increasingly important to coordinate the
different microcircuits and to integrate breathing into a rich behavioral
repertoire that links breathing to sensory processing, arousal, and emotions as
well as learning and memory.

Circadian clocks control physiology and behavior of organisms in synchrony with
external light dark cycles in changing photoperiods. The Madeira cockroach
Rhyparobia maderae was the first model organism in which an endogenous circadian 
clock in the brain was identified. About 240 neurons constitute the cockroach
circadian pacemaker network in the accessory medulla. The expression of high
concentrations of neuropeptides, among them the most prominent circadian coupling
factor pigment-dispersing factor, as well as their ability to generate endogenous
ultradian and circadian rhythms in electrical activity and clock gene expression 
distinguish these pacemaker neurons. We assume that entrainment to light-dark
cycles and the control of 24h rest-activity rhythms is achieved via peptidergic
circuits forming autoreceptive labeled lines.

The role of sensory feedback in shaping locomotion has been long debated. Recent 
advances in genetics and behavior analysis revealed the importance of
proprioceptive pathways in spinal circuits. The mechanisms underlying peripheral 
mechanosensation enabled to unravel the networks that feedback to spinal circuits
in order to modulate locomotion. Sensory inputs to the vertebrate spinal cord
were long thought to originate from the periphery. Recent studies challenge this 
view: GABAergic sensory neurons located within the spinal cord have been shown to
relay mechanical and chemical information from the cerebrospinal fluid to motor
circuits. Innovative approaches combining genetics, quantitative analysis of
behavior and optogenetics now allow probing the contribution of these sensory
feedback pathways to locomotion and recovery following spinal cord injury.

Despite its simple and highly-ordered circuitry the function of the cerebellum
remains a topic of vigorous debate. This review explores connections between the 
cerebellum and sensory processing structures that closely resemble the cerebellum
in terms of their evolution, development, patterns of gene expression, and
circuitry. Recent studies of cerebellum-like structures involved in
electrosensory processing in fish have provided insights into the functions of
granule cells and unipolar brush cells-cell types shared with the cerebellum. We 
also discuss the possibility, supported by recent studies, that generating and
subtracting predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands may be core
functions shared by both cerebellum-like structures and the cerebellum.

Recent trends in neuroscience have narrowed the scope of this field, notably
through the progressive elimination of 'model systems' that were key to the
development of modern molecular, developmental and functional neuroscience.
Although the fantastic opportunities offered by modern molecular biology entirely
justify the use of selected organisms (e.g., for their genetic advantages), we
argue that a diversity of model systems is essential if we wish to identify the
brain's computational principles. It is through comparisons that we can hope to
separate mechanistic details (results of each organism's specific history) from
functional principles, those that will hopefully one day lead to a theory of the 
brain.

The retinotectal circuit is the major component of the amphibian visual system.
It is comprised of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which project
their axons to the optic tectum and form synapses onto postsynaptic tectal
neurons. The retinotectal circuit is relatively simple, and develops quickly:
Xenopus tadpoles begin displaying retinotectal-dependent visual avoidance
behaviors by approximately 7-8 days post-fertilization, early larval stage. In
this review we first provide a summary of the dynamic development of the
retinotectal circuit, including the microcircuitry formed by local tectal-tectal 
connections within the tectum. Second, we discuss the basic visual avoidance
behavior generated specifically by this circuit, and how this behavior is being
used as an assay to test visual system function.

Recent research on molluscan nervous systems provides a unique perspective on the
evolution of neural circuits. Molluscs evolved large, encephalized nervous
systems independently from other phyla. Homologous body-patterning genes were
re-specified in molluscs to create a plethora of body plans and nervous system
organizations. Octopuses, having the largest brains of any invertebrate,
independently evolved a learning circuit similar in organization and function to 
the mushroom body of insects and the hippocampus of mammals. In gastropods,
homologous neurons have been re-specified for different functions. Even species
exhibiting similar, possibly homologous behavior have fundamental differences in 
the connectivity of the neurons underlying that behavior. Thus, molluscan nervous
systems provide clear examples of re-purposing of homologous genes and neurons
for neural circuits.

The crustacean stomatogastric nervous system is a long-standing test bed for
studies of circuit dynamics and neuromodulation. We give a brief update on the
most recent work on this system, with an emphasis on the broader implications for
understanding neural circuits. In particular, we focus on new findings
underlining that different levels of dynamics taking place at different time
scales all interact in multiple ways. Dynamics due to synaptic and intrinsic
neuronal properties, neuromodulation, and long-term gene expression-dependent
regulation are not independent, but influence each other. Extensive research on
the stomatogastric system shows that these dynamic interactions convey robustness
to circuit operation, while facilitating the flexibility of producing multiple
circuit outputs.

Neocortex evolutionary expansion is primarily due to increased proliferative
capacity of neural progenitor cells during cortical development. Exploiting
insights into the cell biology of cortical progenitors gained during the past two
decades, recent studies uncovered a variety of gene expression differences that
underlie differential cortical progenitor behavior. These comprise both,
differences between cortical areas that likely provide a molecular basis for
cortical folding, and differences across species thought to be responsible for
increases in neocortex size. Human-specific signatures have been identified for
gene regulatory elements, non-coding gene products, and protein-encoding genes,
and have been functionally examined in in vivo as well as novel in vitro model
systems.

Execution of motor behaviors relies on the ability of circuits within the nervous
system to engage functionally relevant subtypes of spinal motor neurons. While
much attention has been given to the role of networks of spinal interneurons on
setting the rhythm and pattern of output from locomotor circuits, recent studies 
suggest that motor neurons themselves can exert an instructive role in shaping
the wiring and functional properties of locomotor networks. Alteration in the
distribution of motor neuron subtypes also appears to have contributed to
evolutionary transitions in the locomotor strategies used by land vertebrates.
This review describes emerging evidence that motor neuron-derived cues can have a
profound influence on the organization, wiring, and evolutionary diversification 
of locomotor circuits.

A fundamental question in developmental neuroscience is how hundreds of diverse
cell types are generated to form specialized brain regions. The ganglionic
eminences (GEs) are embryonic brain structures located in the ventral
telencephalon that produce many inhibitory GABA (γ-Aminobutyric acid)-ergic cell 
types, including long-range projection neurons and local interneurons (INs),
which disperse widely throughout the brain. While much has been discovered about 
the origin and wiring of these cells, a major question remains: how do neurons
originating in the GEs become specified during development as one differentiated 
subtype versus another? This review will cover recent work that has advanced our 
knowledge of the mechanisms governing cortical interneuron subtype specification,
particularly progenitors' spatial origin, birthdates, lineage, and mode of
division.

Over a century of efforts to categorize the astonishing diversity of cortical
neurons has relied on criteria of morphology, electrophysiology, ontology, and
the expression of a few transcripts and proteins. The rapid development of
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) adds genome-wide gene expression patterns 
to this list of criteria, and promises to reveal new insights into the
transitions that establish neuronal identity during development, differentiation,
activity, and disease. Comparing single neuron data to reference atlases
constructed from hundreds of thousands of single-cell transcriptomes will be
critical to understanding these transitions and the molecular mechanisms that
drive them. We review early efforts, and discuss future challenges and
opportunities, in applying scRNA-seq to the elucidation of neuronal subtypes and 
their development.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein expression
through post-transcriptional mechanisms. They participate in broad aspects of
biology from the control of developmental processes to tumorigenesis. Recent
studies in Drosophila show that they also regulate activity-dependent and
sensory-specific protein expression and support olfactory memory formation. Among
the hundreds of miRs described, several have been demonstrated to be required for
normal learning, memory, or for the development of neuronal circuits that support
memory formation. Fly models of human diseases offer promise of identifying miRs 
whose expression becomes dysregulated and part of the pathological state,
providing models for understanding brain disorders and drug discovery.

In the brain, the formation of complex neuronal networks amenable to
experience-dependent remodeling is complicated by the diversity of neurons and
synapse types. The establishment of a functional brain depends not only on
neurons, but also non-neuronal glial cells. Glia are in continuous bi-directional
communication with neurons to direct the formation and refinement of synaptic
connectivity. This article reviews important findings, which uncovered cellular
and molecular aspects of the neuron-glia cross-talk that govern the formation and
remodeling of synapses and circuits. In vivo evidence demonstrating the critical 
interplay between neurons and glia will be the major focus. Additional attention 
will be given to how aberrant communication between neurons and glia may
contribute to neural pathologies.

Plasticity of excitability can come in two general forms: changes in excitability
that alter neuronal output (e.g. long-term potentiation of intrinsic
excitability) or excitability changes that stabilize neuronal output (homeostatic
plasticity). Here we discuss the latter form of plasticity in the context of the 
crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, and a second central pattern generator 
circuit, the cardiac ganglion. We discuss this plasticity at three levels: rapid 
homeostatic changes in membrane conductance, longer-term effects of
neuromodulation on excitability, and the impacts of activity-dependent feedback
on steady-state channel mRNA levels. We then conclude with thoughts on the
implications of plasticity of excitability for variability of conductance levels 
across populations of motor neurons.

Stability of neural circuits is reliant on homeostatic mechanisms that return
neuron activity towards pre-determined and physiologically appropriate levels.
Without these mechanisms, changes due to synaptic plasticity, ageing and disease 
may push neural circuits towards instability. Whilst widely documented,
understanding of how and when neurons determine an appropriate activity level,
the so-called set-point, remains unknown. Genetically tractable model systems
have greatly contributed to our understanding of neuronal homeostasis and
continue to offer attractive models to explore these additional questions. This
review focuses on the development of Drosophila motoneurons including defining an
embryonic critical period during which these neurons encode their set-points to
enable homeostatic regulation of activity.

We describe recent advances in quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) geometry
and mechanics of whisking. Careful delineation of relevant 3D reference frames
reveals important geometric and mechanical distinctions between the localization 
problem ('where' is an object) and the feature extraction problem ('what' is an
object). Head-centered and resting-whisker reference frames lend themselves to
quantifying temporal and kinematic cues used for object localization. The
whisking-centered reference frame lends itself to quantifying the contact
mechanics likely associated with feature extraction. We offer the 'windowed
sampling' hypothesis for active sensing: that rats can estimate an object's
spatial features by integrating mechanical information across whiskers during
brief (25-60ms) windows of 'haptic enclosure' with the whiskers, a motion that
resembles a hand grasp.

Diverse mammalian ultradian rhythms (URs) with periods in the 1-6h range, are
omnipresent at multiple levels of biological organization and of functional and
adaptive significance. Specification of neuroendocrine substrates that generate
URs remains elusive. The suprachiasmatic (SCN) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of the
rodent hypothalamus subserve several behavioral URs. Recently, in a major
advance, dopaminergic signaling in striatal circuitry, likely at D2 receptors,
has been implicated in behavioral and thermoregulatory URs of mice. We propose a 
neural network in which reciprocal communication among the SCN, the ARC and
striatal dopaminergic circuitry modulates the period and waveform of behavioral
and physiological URs.

The olfactory bulb and piriform cortex are the best studied structures of the
mammalian olfactory system and are heavily innervated by extrinsic
neuromodulatory inputs. The state-dependent release of acetylcholine,
norepinephrine, serotonin, and other neuromodulators into these olfactory
structures alters a constellation of physiological parameters in neurons and
synapses that together modify the computations performed on sensory signals.
These modifications affect the specificity, detectability, discriminability, and 
other properties of odor representations and thereby govern perceptual
performance. Whereas different neuromodulators have distinct cellular effects,
and tend to be associated with nominally different functions, it also is clear
that these purported functions overlap substantially, and that ad hoc hypotheses 
regarding the roles of particular neuromodulators may have reached the limits of 
their usefulness.

The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are crucial for learning and memory-guided 
behavior, but neural mechanisms underlying their coordinated operation are
currently unclear. Recent evidence indicates that different network activity
patterns, each marked by local field potential signatures, play distinct roles in
mediating long-range interactions between these regions to support memory
processing. We propose that network patterns underlie multiple communication
modes between these regions, and support different cognitive demands during
ongoing behavior. Network patterns may represent a fundamental neurophysiological
mechanism through which the hippocampus communicates memory-related information
with other regions. Dissecting the causal roles of these network patterns in
cognitive processes has the potential to delineate a coherent and dynamic
functional organization across hippocampal and prefrontal networks during
memory-guided behavior.

At least one non-human primate species-the marmoset monkey-exhibits developmental
processes similar to human vocal development. These processes include
babbling-like early vocal output and a role for social feedback in changing this 
output into mature-sounding vocalizations. Such parallel behaviors provide a
window through which we can begin to understand the physiological mechanisms for 
how early vocalizations are produced and shaped by social feedback. The latest
work shows that the acoustic structure of babbling in infant monkeys is driven by
oscillations of the autonomic nervous system. It is hypothesized that this
autonomic nervous system rhythm is perturbed through vocal interactions between
infants and parents. These interactions gradually accelerate the transformation
of immature vocalizations into mature forms.

Touch is often conceived as a spatial sense akin to vision. However, touch also
involves the transduction and processing of signals that vary rapidly over time, 
inviting comparisons with hearing. In both sensory systems, first order afferents
produce spiking responses that are temporally precise and the timing of their
responses carries stimulus information. The precision and informativeness of
spike timing in the two systems invites the possibility that both implement
similar mechanisms to extract behaviorally relevant information from these
precisely timed responses. Here, we explore the putative roles of spike timing in
touch and hearing and discuss common mechanisms that may be involved in
processing temporal spiking patterns.

Making decisions that factor the cost of time is fundamental to survival. Yet,
while it is readily appreciated that our perception of time is intimately
involved in this process, theories regarding intertemporal decision-making and
theories regarding time perception are treated, largely, independently. Even
within these respective domains, models providing good fits to data fail to
provide insight as to why, from a normative sense, those fits should take their
apparent form. Conversely, normative models that proffer a rationalization for
why an agent should weigh options in a particular way, or to perceive time in a
particular way, fail to account for the full body of well-established
experimental evidence. Here we review select, yet key advances in our
understanding, identifying conceptual breakthroughs in the fields of
intertemporal decision-making and in time perception, as well as their limits and
failings in the face of hard-won experimental observation. On this background of 
accrued knowledge, a new conception unifying the domains of decision-making and
time perception is put forward (Training-Integrated Maximization of Reinforcement
Rate, TIMERR) to provide a better fit to observations and a more parsimonious
reckoning of why we make choices, and thereby perceive time, the way we do.

Pathways from cortical and subcortical structures give the prefrontal cortex a
panoramic view of the sensory environment and the internal milieu of motives and 
drives. The prefrontal cortex also receives privileged information from the
output of the basal ganglia and cerebellum and innervates widely the inhibitory
thalamic reticular nucleus that gates thalamo-cortical communication.
Connections, in general, are strongly related to the systematic structural
variation of the cortex that can be traced to development. Insights from
development have profound implications for the special connections of the
prefrontal cortex for executive control, learning and memory, and vulnerability
in psychiatric and neurologic diseases.

Most of the general principles used to explain sensory cortical function have
been inferred from experiments performed on neocortical, primary sensory areas.
Attempts to apply a neocortical view to the study of the gustatory cortex (GC)
have provided only a limited understanding of this area. Failures to conform GC
to classical neocortical principles have been implicitly interpreted as a
demonstration of GC's uniqueness. Here we propose to take the opposite
perspective, dismissing GC's uniqueness and using principles extracted from its
study as a lens for looking at neocortical sensory function. In this review, we
describe three significant findings related to gustatory cortical function and
advocate their relevance for understanding neocortical sensory areas.

Tympanic hearing is a true evolutionary novelty that arose in parallel within
early tetrapods. We propose that in these tetrapods, selection for sound
localization in air acted upon pre-existing directionally sensitive brainstem
circuits, similar to those in fishes. Auditory circuits in birds and lizards
resemble this ancestral, directionally sensitive framework. Despite this
anatomically similarity, coding of sound source location differs between birds
and lizards, although all show mechanisms for enhancing sound source
directionality. Comparisons with mammals reveal similarly complex interactions
between coding strategies and evolutionary history.

Developing neural circuits are especially susceptible to environmental
perturbation. Endocrine signaling systems such as steroids provide a mechanism to
encode physiological changes and integrate function across various biological
systems including the brain. 'Neurosteroids' are synthesized and act within the
brain across development. There is a long history of steroids sculpting
developing neural circuits; more recently, evidence has demonstrated how
neurosteroids influence the early potential for neural circuits to organize and
transmit precise information via non-canonical receptor types.

From the optic tectum to the primary visual cortex: migration through evolution
of the saliency map for exogenous attentional guidance.

Zhaoping L(1).

address: z.li@ucl.ac.uk.

Recent data have supported the hypothesis that, in primates, the primary visual
cortex (V1) creates a saliency map from visual input. The exogenous guidance of
attention is then realized by means of monosynaptic projections to the superior
colliculus, which can select the most salient location as the target of a gaze
shift. V1 is less prominent, or is even absent in lower vertebrates such as fish;
whereas the superior colliculus, called optic tectum in lower vertebrates, also
receives retinal input. I review the literature and propose that the saliency map
has migrated from the tectum to V1 over evolution. In addition, attentional
benefits manifested as cueing effects in humans should also be present in lower
vertebrates.

Recent advances in systems neuroscience have solidified the view that many
cognitive processes are supported by dynamic interactions within and between
large-scale brain networks. Here we synthesize this research, highlighting
dynamic network interactions supporting a less explored aspect of cognition with 
important clinical relevance: internally-oriented cognition. We first present a
brief overview of established resting-state networks, focusing on those
supporting internally-oriented cognition, as well as those involved in dynamic
control. We then discuss recent empirical work emphasizing that many cognitive
tasks involving internally-oriented processes-such as mind-wandering,
prospection, and creative thinking-rely on dynamic interactions within and
between large-scale networks. Our aim is to provide a snapshot of emerging trends
and future directions in an important aspect of human cognition.

During adolescence, individuals are particularly susceptible to social influence.
One explanation for this is that social stimuli have a heightened reward value at
this age. To date, most evidence for heightened social reward in adolescence is
found in the animal literature. Human adolescents show increased activation in
fronto-striatal brain regions to rewarding social stimuli, but also to negative
social stimuli, suggesting that adolescence may be a period of hypersensitivity
to all social stimuli. Additional evidence from humans and animals suggest that
the presence of others may heighten the value of non-social rewards; these
findings should be incorporated into theories of social reward in adolescence.

When brain rhythms aren't 'rhythmic': implication for their mechanisms and
meaning.

States. Electronic address: Stephanie_Jones@Brown.edu.

Rhythms are a prominent signature of brain activity. Their expression is
correlated with numerous examples of healthy information processing and their
fluctuations are a marker of disease states. Yet, their causal or epiphenomenal
role in brain function is still highly debated. We review recent studies showing 
brain rhythms are not always 'rhythmic', by which we mean representative of
repeated cycles of activity. Rather, high power and continuous rhythms in
averaged signals can represent brief transient events on single trials whose
density accumulates in the average. We also review evidence showing time-domain
signals with vastly different waveforms can exhibit identical spectral-domain
frequency and power. Further, non-oscillatory waveform feature can create
spurious high spectral power. Knowledge of these possibilities is essential when 
interpreting rhythms and is easily missed without considering pre-processed data.
Lastly, we discuss how these findings suggest new directions to pursue in our
quest to discover the mechanism and meaning of brain rhythms.

The capacity to generate action potentials in neurons and other excitable cells
requires tuning of both ionic channel expression and kinetics in a large
parameter space. Alongside studies that extend traditional focus on control-based
regulation of structural parameters (channel densities), there is a budding
interest in self-organization of kinetic parameters. In this picture, ionic
channels are continually forced by activity in-and-out of a pool of states not
available for the mechanism of excitability. The process, acting on expressed
structure, provides a bed for generation of a spectrum of excitability modes.
Driven by microscopic fluctuations over a broad range of temporal scales,
self-organization of kinetic parameters enriches the concepts and tools used in
the study of development of excitability.

In the last few years, work in the nascent field of neuroeconomics has advanced
understanding of the brain systems involved in value-based decision making. An
important modulator of valuation processes is the specific context a decision
maker is facing during choice. Recently, neuroeconomics has made great progress
in understanding, on both the brain and behavioral level, how context-dependent
perception affects valuation and choice. Here we describe how context-sensitive
value coding accounts for choice set effects, differential perceptions of gains
and losses, and expectancy effects of external (economic) signals.

All animals must eat in order to survive but first they must successfully locate 
and appraise food resources in a manner consonant with their needs. To accomplish
this, external sensory information, in particular olfactory food cues, need to be
detected and appropriately categorized. Recent advances in Drosophila point to
the existence of parallel processing circuits within the central brain that
encode odor valence, supporting approach and avoidance behaviors. Strikingly,
many elements within these neural systems are subject to modification as a
function of the fly's satiety state. In this review we describe those advances
and their potential impact on the decision to feed.

Direction selectivity is a classic neuronal computation that has been described
in many different sensory systems. The circuit basis of this computation is
perhaps best understood in the retina, where direction selectivity is the result 
of asymmetric connectivity patterns between excitatory and inhibitory circuit
components. Retinal direction selective circuits emerge before eye-opening,
though components of the circuit undergo refinement after vision begins. These
features make the direction selective circuit a rich model in which to
investigate neuronal circuit assembly. In this Opinion, we highlight recent
experiments investigating the contribution of various molecular cues, as well as 
neuronal activity, to the development of the retinal direction selective circuit.

While the cerebellum has traditionally been thought of as mainly involved in
motor functions, evidence has been accumulating for cerebellar contributions also
to non-motor, cognitive functions. The notion of a cerebellar internal model
underlying prediction and processing of sensory events and coordination and
fine-tuning of appropriate responses has put the cerebellum right at the
interface of motor behavior and cognition. Along these lines, the cerebellum may 
critically contribute to performance monitoring, a set of cognitive and affective
functions underlying adaptive behavior. This review presents and integrates
evidence from recent neuroimaging and clinical studies for a cerebellar role in
performance monitoring with focus on sensory prediction, error and conflict
processing, response inhibition, and feedback learning. Together with evidence
for involvement in articulatory monitoring during working memory, these findings 
suggest monitoring as the cerebellum's overarching function.

Multisensory integration is observed in many subcortical and cortical locations
including primary and non-primary sensory cortex, and higher cortical areas
including frontal and parietal cortex. During unisensory perceptual tasks many of
these same brain areas show neural signatures associated with decision-making. It
is unclear whether multisensory representations in sensory cortex directly inform
decision-making in a multisensory task, or if cross-modal signals are only
combined after the accumulation of unisensory evidence at a final decision-making
stage in higher cortical areas. Manipulations of neuronal activity are required
to establish causal roles for given brain regions in multisensory perceptual
decision-making, and so far indicate that distributed networks underlie
multisensory decision-making. Understanding multisensory integration requires
synthesis of small-scale pathway specific and large-scale network level
manipulations.

Brain, body and environment are in continuous dynamical interaction, and it is
becoming increasingly clear that an animal's behavior must be understood as a
product not only of its nervous system, but also of the ongoing feedback of this 
neural activity through the biomechanics of its body and the ecology of its
environment. Modeling has an essential integrative role to play in such an
understanding. But successful whole-animal modeling requires an animal for which 
detailed behavioral, biomechanical and neural information is available and a
modeling methodology which can gracefully cope with the constantly changing
balance of known and unknown biological constraints. Here we review recent
progress on both optogenetic techniques for imaging and manipulating neural
activity and neuromechanical modeling in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis
elegans. This work demonstrates both the feasibility and challenges of
whole-animal modeling.

Converging evidence from neural, perceptual and simulated data suggests that
discrete attractor states form within neural circuits through learning and
development. External stimuli may bias neural activity to one attractor state or 
cause activity to transition between several discrete states. Evidence for such
transitions, whose timing can vary across trials, is best accrued through
analyses that avoid any trial-averaging of data. One such method, hidden Markov
modeling, has been effective in this context, revealing state transitions in many
neural circuits during many tasks. Concurrently, modeling efforts have revealed
computational benefits of stimulus processing via transitions between attractor
states. This review describes the current state of the field, with comments on
how its perceived limitations have been addressed.

Enduring social bonds play an essential role in human society. These bonds
positively affect psychological, physiological, and behavioral functions. Here,
we review the recent literature on the neurobiology, particularly the role of
oxytocin and dopamine, of pair bond formation, bond disruption, and social
buffering effects on stress responses, from studies utilizing the socially
monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster).

Connections and interactions among distributed brain areas are increasingly
recognized as the basis for cognitive operations and a diverse repertoire of
behaviors. Analytic advances have allowed for brain connectivity to be
represented and quantified at multiple levels: from single connections to
communities and networks. This review traces the trajectory of network
neuroscience, focusing on how connectivity patterns can be related to cognition
and behavior. As recent initiatives for open science provide access to imaging
and phenotypic data with great detail and depth, we argue that approaches capable
of directly modeling multivariate relationships between brain and behavior will
become increasingly important in the field.

Neuronal mitochondria are receiving a rapidly increasing level of attention. This
is to a significant part due to the ability to visualize neuronal mitochondria in
novel ways, especially in vivo. Such an approach allows studying neuronal
mitochondria in an intact tissue context, during different developmental states
and in various genetic backgrounds and disease conditions. Hence, in vivo imaging
of mitochondria in the nervous system can reveal aspects of the 'mitochondrial
life cycle' in neurons that hitherto have remained obscure or could only be
inferred indirectly. In this survey of the current literature, we review the new 
insights that have emerged from studies using mitochondrial imaging in intact
neural preparations ranging from worms to mice.

Mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are often linked to specific
neurological disorders, suggesting that each of these RBPs regulates a particular
neuronal function. Instead, they recognise many mRNAs and often participate in
various post-transcriptional processes. To gain specificity, RBPs bind to RNA in 
collaboration with other RBPs. This model also explains how an RBP can play
diverse roles: many RBPs do not contain an effector domain, which joins the
RNA-protein complex as an additional unit. Different complexes, even if anchored 
on the same RBP, recruit diverse effectors. Therefore, the combination of RBPs
determines the fate of an mRNA. We argue that new experimental and bioinformatic 
paradigms are needed to elucidate the combination of RBPs acting on a given mRNA.

In the nervous system, communication between neurons and their post-synaptic
target cells is critical for the formation, refinement and maintenance of
functional neuronal connections. Diffusible signals secreted by target tissues,
exemplified by the family of neurotrophins, impinge on nerve terminals to
influence diverse developmental events including neuronal survival and axonal
growth. Key mechanisms of action of target-derived neurotrophins include the cell
biological processes of endocytosis and retrograde trafficking of their Trk
receptors from growth cones to cell bodies. In this review, we summarize the
molecular mechanisms underlying this endosome-mediated signaling, focusing on the
instructive role of neurotrophin signaling itself in directing its own
trafficking. Recent studies have linked impaired neurotrophin trafficking to
neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the relevance of neurotrophin
endosomes in human health.

Emerging and strengthening evidence suggests an important role of myelin in
plasticity and axonal survival. However, the mechanisms regulating progression
from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes
remain only partially understood. A series of overlapping yet distinct epigenetic
events occur as a proliferating OPC exits the cell cycle, initiates
differentiation, and becomes a myelin-forming oligodendrocyte that wraps axons.
Here we discuss recent advances towards understanding the epigenetic control of
oligodendrocyte development that integrates environmental stimuli. We suggest
that OPCs are directly responsive to extrinsic signals due to predominantly
euchromatic nuclei, while the heterochromatic nuclei render differentiating and
myelinating cells less susceptible to signals modulating the epigenome.

Neocortex expansion in development and evolution reflects an increased and
prolonged activity of neural progenitor cells. Insight into key aspects of the
underlying cell biology has recently been obtained. First, the restriction of
apical progenitors to undergo mitosis at the ventricular surface is overcome by
generation of basal progenitors, which are free to undergo mitosis at
abventricular location, typically the subventricular zone. This process involves 
basolateral ciliogenesis, delamination from the apical adherens junction belt,
and loss of apical cell polarity. Second, proliferative capacity of basal
progenitors is supported by self-produced extracellular matrix constituents,
which in turn promote growth factor signalling. Humans amplify these processes by
characteristic alterations in expression of key regulatory genes (PAX6), and via 
human-specific genes (ARHGAP11B).

Neurons are organized and connected into functional circuits by axons that
conduct action potentials. Many vertebrate axons are myelinated and further
subdivided into excitable domains that include the axon initial segment (AIS) and
nodes of Ranvier. Nodes of Ranvier regenerate and propagate action potentials,
while AIS regulate action potential initiation and neuronal polarity. Two
distinct cytoskeletons control axon structure and function: 1) a submembranous
ankyrin/spectrin cytoskeleton that clusters ion channels and provides mechanical 
support, and 2) a microtubule-based cytoskeleton that controls selective
trafficking of dendritic and axonal cargoes. Here, we review recent studies that 
provide significant additional insight into the cytoskeleton-dependent mechanisms
controlling the functional organization of axons.

Axon degeneration is an essential part of development, plasticity, and injury
response and has been primarily studied in mammalian models in three contexts: 1)
Axotomy-induced Wallerian degeneration, 2) Apoptosis-induced axon degeneration
(axon apoptosis), and 3) Axon pruning. These three contexts dictate engagement of
distinct pathways for axon degeneration. Recent advances have identified the
importance of SARM1, NMNATs, NAD+ depletion, and MAPK signaling in
axotomy-induced Wallerian degeneration. Interestingly, apoptosis-induced axon
degeneration and axon pruning have many shared mechanisms both in signaling (e.g.
DLK, JNKs, GSK3α/β) and execution (e.g. Puma, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3).
However, the specific mechanisms by which caspases are activated during apoptosis
versus pruning appear distinct, with apoptosis requiring Apaf-1 but not caspase-6
while pruning requires caspase-6 but not Apaf-1.

A core function of neural cells is the exchange and integration of information.
Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes and microvesicles recently entered the
scene of neuroscience as novel vehicles transmitting complex signals between
neural cells. Carrying a defined but mixed cargo of biomolecules, extracellular
vesicles possess versatile biological activities with the ability to profoundly
modulate the molecular configuration and behaviour of target cells. Extracellular
vesicles are suggested to carry out functions during neural development and
maintenance, they appear to spread neuropathology and furthermore, convey
neuroprotection and regeneration. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of this 
sophisticated cellular crosstalk will fundamentally improve our insight in
complex intercellular processes in the healthy and diseased nervous system.

Myelination of axons in the central nervous system results from the remarkable
ability of oligodendrocytes to wrap multiple axons with highly specialized
membrane. Because myelin membrane grows as it ensheaths axons, cytoskeletal
rearrangements that enable ensheathment must be coordinated with myelin
production. Because the myelin sheaths of a single oligodendrocyte can differ in 
thickness and length, mechanisms that coordinate axon ensheathment with myelin
growth likely operate within individual oligodendrocyte processes. Recent studies
have revealed new information about how assembly and disassembly of actin
filaments helps drive the leading edge of nascent myelin membrane around and
along axons. Concurrently, other investigations have begun to uncover evidence of
communication between axons and oligodendrocytes that can regulate myelin
formation.

Synapses are the basic unit of neuronal communication and their disruption is
associated with many neurological disorders. Significant progress has been made
towards understanding the molecular and genetic regulation of synapse formation, 
modulation, and dysfunction, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain
incomplete. The actin cytoskeleton not only provides the structural foundation
for synapses, but also regulates a diverse array of cellular activities
underlying synaptic function. Here we will discuss the regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory
synapses. We will focus on a select number of actin regulatory processes,
highlighting recent advances, the complexity of crosstalk between different
pathways, and the challenges of understanding their precise impact on the
structure and function of synapses.

Axon extension, guidance and tissue invasion share many similarities to normal
cell migration and cancer cell metastasis. Proper cell and growth cone migration 
requires tightly regulated adhesion complex assembly and detachment from the
extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, many cell types actively remodel the ECM
using matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) to control tissue invasion and cell
dispersal. Targeting and activating MMPs is a tightly regulated process, that
when dysregulated, can lead to cancer cell metastasis. Interestingly, new
evidence suggests that growth cones express similar cellular and molecular
machinery as migrating cells to clutch retrograde actin flow on ECM proteins and 
target matrix degradation, which may be used to facilitate axon pathfinding
through the basal lamina and across tissues.

Cognitive processes including memory formation and learning rely on a precise,
local and dynamic control of synapse functionality executed by molecular changes 
within both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. Recently, the size of the 
presynaptic active zone scaffold, a cluster of large multi-domain proteins
decorating the presynaptic plasma membrane, was found to directly scale with the 
action potential evoked release of synaptic vesicles. The challenge now is to
constitute an integrated picture of how long-range axonal transport, local
exchange and localization mechanisms at the scaffold and degradation processes
are integrated to allow for dynamic and controlled scaffold rearrangements. Here 
we discuss findings from multiple model systems emphasizing both short-term and
long-term regulations of active zone composition and function.

Neurons are highly polarized cells with axonal and dendritic projections that
extend over long distances. Target-derived neurotrophins provide local axonal
cues that function in developing neurons, while physical or chemical injuries to 
long axons initiate local environmental cues in mature neurons. In both instances
initial responses at the location of stimulation or injury must be coordinated
with changes in the transcriptional program and subsequent changes in axonal
protein content. To achieve this coordination, intracellular signals move 'there 
and back again' between axons and the nucleus. Here, we review new findings on
neuronal responses to growth factors and injury and highlight the coordination of
transcription, translation and transport required to mediate communication
between axons and cell bodies.

Localization and local translation of mRNA plays a key role in neuronal
development and function. While studies in various systems have provided insights
into molecular mechanisms of mRNA transport and local protein synthesis, the
factors that control the assembly of mRNAs and mRNA binding proteins into
messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) transport granules remain largely unknown. In 
this review we will discuss how insights on a motor neuron disease, spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA), is advancing our understanding of regulated assembly of
transport competent mRNPs and how defects in their assembly and delivery may
contribute to the degeneration of motor neurons observed in SMA and other
neurological disorders.

During development oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) rapidly proliferate and
migrate throughout the central nervous system. The mobilization of OPCs is
followed by terminal differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes and the
subsequent myelination of axons. Differentiation of OPCs is CNS-wide and robust, 
and yet spatially and temporally restricted. What factors control this precise
and coordinated differentiation effort? We discuss evidence for both intrinsic
and extrinsic cues in regulating OPC differentiation and gather that extrinsic
cues play the leading role in regulating the differentiation of OPCs into mature

Peripheral nerves show a remarkable ability to regenerate following a transection
injury. Downstream of the cut, the axons degenerate and so to regenerate the
nerve, the severed axons need to regrow back to their targets and regain
function. This requires the axons to navigate through two different environments.
(1) The bridge of new tissue that forms between the two nerve stumps and (2) the 
distal stump of the nerve that remains associated with the target tissues. This
involves distinct, complex multicellular responses that guide and sustain axonal 
regrowth. These processes have important implications for our understanding of
the regeneration of an adult tissue and have parallels to aspects of tumour
formation and spread.

Microglia are tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS)
that maintain homeostasis and respond to immune challenges. New genetic fate
mapping tools have revealed a yolk sac origin of microglia. Once established in
the CNS, microglia persist throughout the lifetime of the organism behind the
blood-brain barrier and maintain themselves by self-renewal. Recent studies
uncovered a broad spectrum of microglial functions that are influenced by the
dynamism of brain formation and neuronal wiring. This review focuses on current
findings concerning microglia origin and formation during development and
discusses the factors important for microglia survival and function.

The remarkable interaction between glial cells and axons is crucial for nervous
system development and homeostasis. Alterations in this continuous communication 
can cause severe pathologies that can compromise the integrity of the nervous
system. The most dramatic consequence of this interaction is the generation of
the myelin sheath, made by myelinating glial cells: Schwann cells in the
peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In 
this review I will focus on signals coming from axons in the first part and then 
on those from Schwann cells that promote the formation and the maintenance of
peripheral myelin. I will discuss their inter-relationship together with seminal 
and important advances recently made.

Neurotransmission requires the recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to replenish 
the SV pool, clear release sites, and maintain presynaptic integrity. In spite of
decades of research the modes and mechanisms of SV recycling remain
controversial. The identification of clathrin-independent modes of SV recycling
such as ultrafast endocytosis has added to the debate. Accumulating evidence
further suggests that SV membrane retrieval and the reformation of functional SVs
are separable processes. This may allow synapses to rapidly restore membrane
surface area over a wide range of stimulations followed by slow reformation of
release-competent SVs. One of the future challenges will be to pinpoint the exact
mechanisms that link SV recycling modes to synaptic activity patterns at
different synapses.

Neuronal growth and synaptic transmission require the continuous production of
adhesion molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, ion-channels, and secreted
trophic factors, and thus critically relies on the secretory pathway-the series
of intracellular organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the
Golgi apparatus (GA), where membrane lipids and proteins are synthesized.
Commensurate with the gigantic size of the neuronal membrane and its
compartmentalization by thousands of synapses with distinct compositions and
activities, the neuronal secretory pathway has evolved to both traffic synaptic
components over very long distances, and locally control the composition of
specified segments of dendrites. Here we review new insights into the
distribution and dynamics of dendritic secretory organelles and their impact on
postsynaptic compartments.

Cell polarization generates morphological and functional asymmetry, and is
crucial for the development and proper functioning of many cell types. Recent
data have revealed that the microtubule cytoskeleton is a major determinant in
the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Microtubules provide the 
structural basis for neuronal polarization, because of their intrinsic properties
including inherent polarity. Moreover, the polarized microtubule network also
forms the basis for selective cargo trafficking into axons and dendrites. Here we
review recent studies examining the molecular processes that control microtubule 
remodeling and polarized cargo sorting, and propose that changes in microtubule
organization play an instructive role in the initial polarization.

Secreted pheromones have long been known to influence mating in the phylum
Nematoda. The study of nematode sexual behavior has greatly benefited in the last
decade from the genetic and neurobiological tools available for the model
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as from the chemical identification of
many pheromones secreted by this species. The discovery that nematodes can
influence one another's physiological development and stress responsiveness
through the sharing of pheromones, in addition to simply triggering sexual
attraction, is particularly striking. Here we review recent research on nematode 
mating pheromones, which has been conducted predominantly on C. elegans, but
there are beginning to be parallel studies in other species.

Like most animal species, fruit flies fight to obtain and defend resources
essential to survival and reproduction. Aggressive behavior in Drosophila is
genetically specified and also strongly influenced by the fly's social context,
past experiences and internal states, making it an excellent framework for
investigating the neural mechanisms that regulate complex social behaviors. Here,
I summarize our current knowledge of the neural control of aggression in
Drosophila and discuss recent advances in understanding the sensory pathways that
influence the decision to fight or court, the neuromodulatory control of
aggression, the neural basis by which internal states can influence both fighting
and courtship, and how social experience modifies aggressive behavior.

A typical current study investigating the neurobiology of animal behavior is
likely restricted to male subjects, of standard inbred mouse strains, tested in
simple behavioral assays under laboratory conditions. This approach enables the
use of advanced molecular tools, alongside standardization and reproducibility,
and has led to tremendous discoveries. However, the cost is a loss of genetic and
phenotypic diversity and a divergence from ethologically-relevant behaviors. Here
we review the pros and cons in behavioral neuroscience studies of the new era,
focusing on reproductive behaviors in rodents. Recent advances in molecular
technology and behavioral phenotyping in semi-natural conditions, together with
an awareness of the critical need to study both sexes, may provide new insights
into the neural mechanisms underlying social behaviors.

Sexually reproducing animals exhibit sex differences in behavior. Sexual
dimorphisms in mating, aggression, and parental care directly contribute to
reproductive success of the individual and survival of progeny. In this review,
we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular and neural
network mechanisms underlying these behaviors in mice. Notable advances include
novel insights into the sensory control of social interactions and the
identification of molecularly-specified neuronal populations in the brain that
control mating, aggression, and parental behaviors. In the case of the latter,
these advances mark a watershed because scientists can now focus on discrete
neural pathways in an effort to understand how the brain encodes these
fundamental social behaviors.

In socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), mating induces three
primary types of behavior; namely, partner preference, selective aggression
toward conspecific strangers, and bi-parental care, making this rodent an ideal
model system to study sociality and underlying neurochemical mechanisms
associated with monogamous mating strategies. Here, we highlight species
differences in neurochemical receptor distributions associated with mating
experience leading to the establishment of stable pair-bonds. Specifically, we
illustrate the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in programming the formation
and maintenance of monogamous bonds and describe the role of anterior
hypothalamic vasopressin in the regulation of selective aggression. We conclude
by discussing recent molecular work in voles and emphasize the importance of this
rodent for future research in the behavioral neurobiology field.

A single sensory cue can evoke different behaviors that vary by recipient.
Responses may be influenced by sex, internal state, experience, genotype, and
coincident environmental stimuli. Pheromones are powerful inducers of mouse
behavior, yet pheromone responses are not always stereotyped. For example, male
and female mice respond differently to sex pheromones while mothers and virgin
females respond differently to pup cues. Here, we review the origins of
variability in responses to reproductive pheromones. Recent advances have
indicated how response variability may arise through modulation at different
levels of pheromone-processing circuitry, from sensory neurons in the periphery
to central neurons in the vomeronasal amygdala. Understanding mechanisms
underlying conditional pheromone responses should reveal how neural circuits can 
be flexibly sculpted to alter behavior.

Experimental research in non-human mammals indicates that testosterone exposure
during early periods of rapid brain development has enduring influences on brain 
and behaviour. These influences are exerted when testosterone is higher in
developing males than females, and the affected characteristics are those that
differ by sex. Testosterone is higher in males than in females from about weeks 8
to 24 of human gestation and then again during early infancy, and both of these
periods are times of rapid brain development. Substantial evidence suggests that 
testosterone prenatally influences human neurobehavioral development. Emerging
evidence suggests that the early postnatal period is important too. This early
postnatal period could provide a window for studying testosterone interacting
with experience to shape human gender development.

The adolescent transition from childhood to adulthood requires both reproductive 
and behavioral maturation as individuals acquire the ability to procreate.
Gonadal steroid hormones are key players in the maturation of behaviors required 
for reproductive success. Beyond activating behavior in adulthood, testicular and
ovarian hormones organize the adolescent brain and program adult-typical and
sex-typical expression of sociosexual behaviors. Testicular hormones organize
sexual and agonistic behaviors, including social proficiency-the ability to adapt
behavior as a function of social experience. Ovarian hormones organize behaviors 
related to energy balance and maternal care. These sex differences in the
behaviors that are programmed by gonadal hormones during adolescence suggest that
evolution has selected for hormone-dependent sex-specific organization of
behaviors that optimize reproductive fitness.

Gender stereotypes hold that males outperform females in mathematics and spatial 
tests, and females outperform males on verbal tests. According to meta-analyses, 
however, among both children and adults, females perform equally to males on
mathematics assessments. The gender difference in verbal skills is small and
varies depending on the type of skill assessed (e.g., vocabulary, essay writing).
The gender difference in 3D mental rotation shows a moderate advantage for males,
but this gender difference occurs in the absence of a spatial curriculum in the
schools. Meta-analyses of gender differences across a wide array of psychological
qualities support the Gender Similarities Hypothesis, which states that males and
females are quite similar on most-but not all-psychological variables.

Fish comprise half of extant vertebrate species and use a rich variety of
reproductive strategies that have yielded insights into the basic mechanisms that
evolved for sex. To maximize the chances of fertilization and survival of
offspring, fish species time reproduction to occur at optimal times. For years,
ethologists have performed painstaking experiments to identify sensory inputs and
behavioral outputs of the brain during mating. Here we review known mechanisms
that generate sexual behavior, focusing on the factors that govern the timing of 
these displays. The development of new technologies, including high-throughput
sequencing and genome engineering, has the potential to provide novel insights
into how the vertebrate brain consummates mating at the appropriate time.

Increasing interest in sex differences in Caenorhabditis elegans neurobiology is 
resulting from several advances, including the completion of the male tail
connectome and the surprising discovery of two 'new' neurons in the male head. In
this species, sex-specific circuits in the hermaphrodite and male control
reproductive behaviors such as egg-laying and copulation, respectively. Studies
of these systems are revealing interesting similarities and contrasts,
particularly in the mechanisms by which nutritional status influences
reproductive behaviors. Other studies have highlighted the importance of sexual
modulation of shared neurons and circuits in optimizing behavioral strategies.
Together, these findings indicate that C. elegans uses intertwined, distributed
sex differences in circuit structure and function to implement sex-specific as
well as sexually divergent, shared behaviors.

The capacity to communicate via acoustic signals is prevalent across the animal
kingdom, from insects to humans. What are the neural circuit mechanisms that
underlie this ability? New methods for behavioral analysis along with an
unparalleled genetic toolkit have recently opened up studies of acoustic
communication in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Its nervous system
comprises roughly 100,000 neurons, yet flies are able to both produce and process
time-varying sounds during courtship. Just as with more complex animals, sensory 
feedback plays an important role in shaping communication between the sexes.
Here, we review recent work in Drosophila that has laid the foundation for
solving the mechanisms by which sensory information dynamically modulates

The sexual behavior of Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding paradigm to
understand the molecular and neuronal basis of sophisticated animal actions. We
discuss recent advances in our knowledge of the genetic hardwiring of the
underlying neuronal circuitry, and how pertinent sensory cues are differentially 
detected and integrated in the male and female brain. We also consider how
experience influences these circuits over short timescales, and the evolution of 
these pathways over longer timescales to endow species-specific sexual displays
and responses.

Tinbergen proposed that instinctive behaviors can be divided into appetitive and 
consummatory phases. During mating and aggression, the appetitive phase contains 
various actions to bring an animal to a social target and the consummatory phase 
allows stereotyped actions to take place. Here, we summarize recent advances in
elucidating the neural circuits underlying the appetitive and consummatory phases
of sexual and aggressive behaviors with a focus on male mice. We outline the role
of the main olfactory inputs in the initiation of social approach; the engagement
of the accessory olfactory system during social investigation, and the role of
the hypothalamus and its downstream pathways in orchestrating social behaviors
through a suite of motor actions.

Birds commonly use sound for communication between the sexes. In many songbird
species, only males sing and there are pronounced sex differences in the neural
song control circuits. By contrast, the auditory circuitry is largely similar in 
males and females. Both sexes learn to recognize vocalizations heard as juveniles
and this shapes auditory response selectivity. Mating vocalizations are
restricted to the breeding season, when sex steroid levels are elevated. Auditory
cells, from the ear to the cortex, are hormone sensitive. Estrogens are
synthesized in the brain and can modulate the activity of auditory neurons. In
species that breed seasonally, elevated levels of estradiol in females
transiently enhance their auditory responses to conspecific vocalizations,
resulting in sex differences in audition.

Social insect colonies function as highly integrated units despite consisting of 
many individuals. This requires the different functional parts of the colony
(e.g. different castes) to exchange information that aid in colony functioning
and ontogeny. Here we discuss inter-caste communication in three contexts,
firstly, the communication between males and females during courtship, secondly, 
the communication between queens and workers that regulate reproduction and
thirdly, the communication between worker castes that allows colonies to balance 
the number of different worker types. Some signals show surprising complexity in 
both their chemistry and function, whereas others are simple compounds that were 
probably already used as pheromones in the solitary ancestors of several social
insect lineages.

Vocalizations transmit information to social partners, and mice use these signals
to exchange information during courtship. Ultrasonic vocalizations from adult
males are tightly associated with their interactions with females, and vary as a 
function of male quality. Work in the last decade has established that the
spectrotemporal features of male vocalizations are not learned, but that female
attention toward specific vocal features is modified by social experience.
Additionally, progress has been made on elucidating how mouse vocalizations are
encoded in the auditory system, and on the olfactory circuits that trigger their 
production. Together these findings provide us with important insights into how
vocal communication can contribute to social interactions.

Sensory neurons are usually described with an encoding model, for example, a
function that predicts their response from the sensory stimulus using a receptive
field (RF) or a tuning curve. However, central to theories of sensory processing 
is the notion of 'efficient coding'. We argue here that efficient coding implies 
a completely different neural coding strategy. Instead of a fixed encoding model,
neural populations would be described by a fixed decoding model (i.e. a model
reconstructing the stimulus from the neural responses). Because the population
solves a global optimization problem, individual neurons are variable, but not
noisy, and have no truly invariant tuning curve or receptive field. We review
recent experimental evidence and implications for neural noise correlations,
robustness and adaptation.

The ability to record the joint activity of large groups of neurons would allow
for direct study of information representation and computation at the level of
whole circuits in the brain. The combinatorial space of potential population
activity patterns and neural noise imply that it would be impossible to directly 
map the relations between stimuli and population responses. Understanding of
large neural population codes therefore depends on identifying simplifying design
principles. We review recent results showing that strongly correlated population 
codes can be explained using minimal models that rely on low order relations
among cells. We discuss the implications for large populations, and how such
models allow for mapping the semantic organization of the neural codebook and
stimulus space, and decoding.

Vertebrates are remarkable for their ability to select and execute goal-directed 
actions: motor skills critical for thriving in complex, competitive environments.
A key aspect of a motor skill is the ability to execute its component movements
over a range of speeds, amplitudes and frequencies (vigor). Recent work has
indicated that a subcortical circuit, the basal ganglia, is a critical
determinant of movement vigor in rodents and primates. We propose that the basal 
ganglia evolved from a circuit that in lower vertebrates and some mammals is
sufficient to directly command simple or stereotyped movements to one that
indirectly controls the vigor of goal-directed movements. The implications of a
dual role of the basal ganglia in the control of vigor and response to reward are
also discussed.

How the processing of signals carried by sensory neurons supports perceptual
decisions is a long-standing question in neuroscience. The ability to record
neuronal activity in awake animals while they perform psychophysical tasks near
threshold has been a key advance in studying these questions. Trial-to-trial
correlations between the activity of sensory neurons and the decisions reported
by animals ('choice probabilities'), even when measured across repeated
presentations of an identical stimulus provide insights into this problem. But
understanding the sources of such co-variability between sensory neurons and
behavior has proven more difficult than it initially appeared. Below, we discuss 
our current understanding of what gives rise to these correlations.

Psychophysical techniques typically assume straightforward relationships between 
manipulations of real-world events, their effects on the brain, and behavioral
reports of those effects. However, these relationships can be influenced by many 
complex, strategic factors that contribute to task performance. Here we discuss
several of these factors that share two key features. First, they involve
subjects making flexible use of time to process information. Second, this
flexibility can reflect the rational regulation of information-processing
trade-offs that can play prominent roles in particular temporal epochs:
sensitivity to stability versus change for past information, speed versus
accuracy for current information, and exploitation versus exploration for future 
goals. Understanding how subjects manage these trade-offs can be used to help
design and interpret psychophysical studies.

Propelled by advances in biologically inspired computer vision and artificial
intelligence, the past five years have seen significant progress in using deep
neural networks to model response patterns of neurons in visual cortex. In this
paper, we briefly review this progress and then discuss eight key 'open
questions' that we believe will drive research in computational models of sensory
systems over the next five years, both in visual cortex and beyond.

Gradual accumulation of evidence favoring one or another choice is considered a
core component of many different types of decisions, and has been the subject of 
many neurophysiological studies in non-human primates. But its neural circuit
mechanisms remain mysterious. Investigating it in rodents has recently become
possible, facilitating perturbation experiments to delineate the relevant causal 
circuit, as well as the application of other tools more readily available in
rodents. In addition, advances in stimulus design and analysis have aided
studying the relevant neural encoding. In complement to ongoing non-human primate
studies, these newly available model systems and tools place the field at an
exciting time that suggests that the dynamical circuit mechanisms underlying
accumulation of evidence could soon be revealed.

In biological function emerges from the interactions of components with only
partially aligned interests. An example is the brain-a large aggregation of
neurons capable of producing unitary, coherent output. A theory for how such
aggregations produce coherent output remains elusive. A first question we might
ask is how collective is the behavior of the components? Here we introduce two
properties of collectivity and illustrate how these properties can be quantified 
using approaches from information theory and statistical physics. First,
amplification quantifies the sensitivity of the large scale to information at the
small scale and is related to the notion of criticality in statistical physics.
Second, decomposability reveals the extent to which aggregate behavior is
reducible to individual contributions or is the result of synergistic
interactions among components forming larger subgroups. These measures facilitate
identification of causally important components and subgroups that might be
experimentally manipulated to study the evolution and controllability of
biological circuits and their outputs.

Despite significant advances in neuroscience, the neural bases of intelligence
remain poorly understood. Arguably the most elusive aspect of intelligence is the
ability to make robust inferences that go far beyond one's experience. Animals
categorize objects, learn to vocalize and may even estimate causal relationships 
- all in the face of data that is often ambiguous and sparse. Such inductive
leaps are thought to result from the brain's ability to infer latent structure
that governs the environment. However, we know little about the neural
computations that underlie this ability. Recent advances in developing
computational frameworks that can support efficient structure learning and
inductive inference may provide insight into the underlying component processes
and help pave the path for uncovering their neural implementation.

Louis Henry Sullivan, the father of skyscrapers, famously stated 'Form ever
follows function'. In this short review, we will focus on the relationship
between form (structure) and function (dynamics) in the brain. We summarize
recent advances on the quantification of directed- and weighted-mesoscopic
connectivity of mammalian cortex, the exponential distance rule for mesoscopic
and microscopic circuit wiring, a spatially embedded random model of inter-areal 
cortical networks, and a large-scale dynamical circuit model of money's cortex
that gives rise to a hierarchy of timescales. These findings demonstrate that
inter-areal cortical networks are dense (hence such concepts as 'small-world'
need to be refined when applied to the brain), spatially dependent (therefore
purely topological approach of graph theory has limited applicability) and
heterogeneous (consequently cortical areas cannot be treated as identical
'nodes').

Over the past decade neuroscience has been attacking the problem of cognition
with increasing vigor. Yet, what exactly is cognition, beyond a general signifier
of anything seemingly complex the brain does? Here, we briefly review attempts to
define, describe, explain, build, enhance and experience cognition. We highlight 
perspectives including psychology, molecular biology, computation, dynamical
systems, machine learning, behavior and phenomenology. This survey of the
landscape reveals not a clear target for explanation but a pluralistic and
evolving scene with diverse opportunities for grounding future research. We argue
that rather than getting to the bottom of it, over the next century, by
deconstructing and redefining cognition, neuroscience will and should expand
rather than merely reduce our concept of the mind.

The idea that there is a fundamental cortical circuit that performs canonical
computations remains compelling though far from proven. Here we review evidence
for two canonical operations within sensory cortical areas: a feedforward
computation of selectivity; and a recurrent computation of gain in which, given
sufficiently strong external input, perhaps from multiple sources, intracortical 
input largely, but not completely, cancels this external input. This operation
leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple
stimuli. The cortical computation must combine such local processing with
hierarchical processing across areas. We point to important changes in moving
from sensory cortex to motor and frontal cortex and the possibility of

Neurons often respond to diverse combinations of task-relevant variables. This
form of mixed selectivity plays an important computational role which is related 
to the dimensionality of the neural representations: high-dimensional
representations with mixed selectivity allow a simple linear readout to generate 
a huge number of different potential responses. In contrast, neural
representations based on highly specialized neurons are low dimensional and they 
preclude a linear readout from generating several responses that depend on
multiple task-relevant variables. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical
framework that explains the importance of mixed selectivity and the experimental 
evidence that recorded neural representations are high-dimensional. We end by
discussing the implications for the design of future experiments.

Cognition encompasses a range of higher-order mental processes, such as
attention, working memory, and model-based decision-making. These processes are
thought to involve the dynamic interaction of multiple central brain regions. A
mechanistic understanding of such computations requires not only monitoring and
manipulating specific neural populations during behavior, but also knowing the
connectivity of the underlying circuitry. These goals are experimentally
challenging in mammals, but are feasible in numerically simpler insect brains. In
Drosophila melanogaster in particular, genetic tools enable precisely targeted
physiology and optogenetics in actively behaving animals. In this article we
discuss how these advantages are increasingly being leveraged to study abstract
neural representations and sensorimotor computations that may be relevant for
cognition in both insects and mammals.

Sensorimotor control engages cognitive processes such as prediction, learning,
and multisensory integration. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying
these cognitive processes with arm reaching is challenging because we currently
record only a fraction of the relevant neurons, the arm has nonlinear dynamics,
and multiple modalities of sensory feedback contribute to control. A
brain-computer interface (BCI) is a well-defined sensorimotor loop with key
simplifying advantages that address each of these challenges, while engaging
similar cognitive processes. As a result, BCI is becoming recognized as a
powerful tool for basic scientific studies of sensorimotor control. Here, we
describe the benefits of BCI for basic scientific inquiries and review recent BCI
studies that have uncovered new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying
sensorimotor control.

Despite advances in experimental and theoretical neuroscience, we are still
trying to identify key biophysical details that are important for characterizing 
the operation of brain circuits. Biological mechanisms at the level of single
neurons and synapses can be combined as 'building blocks' to generate circuit
function. We focus on the importance of capturing multiple timescales when
describing these intrinsic and synaptic components. Whether inherent in the ionic
currents, the neuron's complex morphology, or the neurotransmitter composition of
synapses, these multiple timescales prove crucial for capturing the variability
and richness of circuit output and enhancing the information-carrying capacity
observed across nervous systems.

Activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been linked both to commitment to
a course of action, even when it is associated with costs, and to exploring or
searching for alternative courses of action. Here we review evidence that this is
due to the presence of multiple signals in ACC reflecting the updating of beliefs
and internal models of the environment and encoding aspects of choice value,
including the average value of choices afforded by the environment ('search
value'). We contrast this evidence with the influential view that ACC activity is
better described as reflecting task difficulty. A consideration of cortical
neural network properties explains why ACC may carry such signals and also
exhibit sensitivity to task difficulty.

The success of systems neuroscience depends on the ability to forge quantitative 
links between neural activity and behavior. Traditionally, this process has
benefited from the rigorous development and testing of hypotheses using tools
derived from classical psychophysics and computational motor control. As our
capacity for measuring neural activity improves, accompanied by powerful new
analysis strategies, it seems prudent to remember what these traditional
approaches have to offer. Here I present a perspective on the merits of
principled task design and tight behavioral control, along with some words of
caution about interpretation in unguided, large-scale neural recording studies. I
argue that a judicious combination of new and old approaches is the best way to
advance our understanding of higher brain function in health and disease.

We suggest that population representation of objects in inferotemporal cortex lie
on a continuum between a purely structural, parts-based description and a purely 
holistic description. The intrinsic dimensionality of object representation is
estimated to be around 100, perhaps with lower dimensionalities for object
representations more toward the holistic end of the spectrum. Cognitive knowledge
in the form of semantic information and task information feed back to
inferotemporal cortex from perirhinal and prefrontal cortex respectively,
providing high-level multimodal-based expectations that assist in the
interpretation of object stimuli. Integration of object information across eye
movements may also contribute to object recognition through a process of active
vision.

The study of sensorimotor learning has a long history. With the advent of
innovative techniques for studying learning at the behavioral and computational
levels new insights have been gained in recent years into how the sensorimotor
system acquires, retains, represents, retrieves and forgets sensorimotor tasks.
In this review we highlight recent advances in the field of sensorimotor learning
from a computational perspective. We focus on studies in which computational
models are used to elucidate basic mechanisms underlying adaptation and skill
acquisition in human behavior.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves higher cognitive abilities such as
planning, reasoning and creativity. Here we review recent findings from both
empirical and theoretical studies providing new insights about these cognitive
abilities and their neural underpinnings in the PFC as overcoming key adaptive
limitations in reinforcement learning. We outline a unified theoretical framework
describing the PFC function as implementing an algorithmic solution approximating
statistically optimal, but computationally intractable, adaptive processes. The
resulting PFC functional architecture combines learning, planning, reasoning and 
creativity processes for balancing exploitation and exploration behaviors and
optimizing behavioral adaptations in uncertain, variable and open-ended
environments.

Recent genome-wide association studies implicate microglia in Alzheimer's disease
(AD) pathogenesis; however, their biological significance remains poorly
understood. Synapse loss is a significant correlate of cognitive decline that
serves as a critical hallmark of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases;
however, mechanisms underlying synaptic vulnerability remain elusive. Emerging
research on microglia function in the healthy brain is providing new insight into
fundamental roles of microglia and immune molecules in brain wiring. Among their 
many roles, microglia prune developing synapses and regulate synaptic plasticity 
and function. Here, we review and discuss how this emerging work may provide new 
insight into how disruptions in microglia-synapse interactions could contribute
to synapse loss and dysfunction, and consequently cognitive impairment, in AD.

Psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous disorders characterized by complex
genetics, variable symptomatology, and anatomically distributed pathology, all of
which present challenges for effective treatment. Current treatments are often
blunt tools used to ameliorate the most severe symptoms, often at the risk of
disrupting functional neural systems, thus there is a pressing need to develop
rational therapeutics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from
patient somatic cells offer an unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate both
normal and pathologic human tissue and organ development, and provides new
approaches for understanding disease mechanisms and for drug discovery with
higher predictability of their effects in humans. Here we review recent progress 
and challenges in using human iPSCs for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders and
developing novel therapeutic strategies.

Ketamine is a psychoactive anesthetic agent, which has been approved and utilized
for various forms of anesthesia over decades. Recently, ketamine has been
demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with 
treatment-resistant depression. After more than a decade of research, it is
unclear what the mechanisms underlying the novel antidepressant effect are. The
consensus has centered on NMDA properties of ketamine as a potential factor in
the mechanism for antidepressant action. However, this may be a true but partial 
explanation of the effects of ketamine as a novel antidepressant. It appears that
ketamine influences synaptic plasticity and may promote new synapse formation.
From a neurocircuitry perspective, ketamine may exert some of its effects on the 
anterior cingulate.

Large-scale collection of postmortem human brain tissue and subsequent genomic
data generation has become a useful approach for better identifying etiological
factors contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, studying
genetic risk variants in non-psychiatric controls can identify biological
mechanisms of risk free from confounding factors related to epiphenomena of
illness. While the field has begun moving towards cell type-specific analyses,
homogenate brain tissue with accompanying cellular profiles, can still identify
useful hypotheses for more focused experiments, particularly when the
dysregulated cell types are unknown. Technological advances, larger sample sizes,
and focused research questions can continue to further leverage postmortem human 
brain research to better identify and understand the molecular etiology of
neuropsychiatric disorders.

Expansion of a GGGGCC repeat in C9orf72 causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
frontotemporal dementia, or a combination of both. Bidirectional repeat
transcripts sequester RNA-binding proteins into nuclear RNA foci. The repeat is
translated into dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that are crucial for
repeat-induced toxicity. DPRs inhibit the proteasome and sequester other
proteins. These changes are accompanied by widespread brain atrophy and
subclinical cognitive impairment before disease onset. Both repeat RNA and DPRs
impair nucleocytoplasmic transport and promote TDP-43 mislocalization and
aggregation. Thus, repeat RNA and DPRs may gradually trigger TDP-43 pathology and
subsequent region-specific neurodegeneration in a cascade similar to amyloid-β
peptide in Alzheimer's disease. The key components of the C9orf72 cascade are
promising therapeutic targets in different disease stages.

Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with high heritability. Recent findings from 
several large genetic studies suggest a large number of risk variants are
involved (i.e. schizophrenia is a polygenic disorder) and analytic approaches
could be tailored for this scenario. Novel statistical approaches for analyzing
GWAS data have recently been developed to be more sensitive to polygenic traits. 
These approaches have provided intriguing new insights into neurobiological
pathways and support for the involvement of regulatory mechanisms,
neurotransmission (glutamate, dopamine, GABA), and immune and neurodevelopmental 
pathways. Integrating the emerging statistical genetics evidence with sound
neurobiological experiments will be a crucial, and challenging, next step in
deciphering the specific disease mechanisms of schizophrenia.

The discovery of over 150 monogenic epilepsies and advances in early genetic
diagnoses have launched a search for molecular strategies and developmental
timetables to reverse or even prevent the course of these debilitating brain
disorders. Orthologous rodent models of key disease genes are providing important
examples of the range of targets, and serve as valuable test systems for
perinatal therapeutic approaches. While gene-specific analyses of single rare
'orphan' diseases are each narrow in scope, they illuminate downstream pathways
converging onto interneurons, and treatments that strengthen inhibition during
cortical maturation may provide broad protection against these seemingly
disparate gene errors. Several genes, even those linked to malformations, show
promise for postnatal correction before the onset of their clinical phenotype.

Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response
observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become
inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide
Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated 
with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD
[1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1,
CD33, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1 and HLA-DRB5-HLA-DRB1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, 
CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many 
encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent 
identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering
receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of
AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently
the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10(••)] (Figure
1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles
of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and
their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression.

The development of cellular reprogramming methods to generate human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has led to the establishment of lines from hundreds
of patients with a variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. One of the
fundamental powers of iPSC technology lies in the competency of these cells to be
directed to become any cell type in the body, thus allowing researchers to
examine disease mechanisms and identify and test novel therapeutics in relevant
cell types. The field has now exited the phase of 'proof-of-principle' studies
showing the potential of the model systems, and it has now entered an exciting
new era where iPSC studies are contributing to the field's understanding of
mechanisms of disease. Here, we describe the challenges of iPSC modeling of
neuropsychiatric disorders, and highlight studies where some of these challenges 
have been addressed to provide novel insights into disease mechanisms.

Fear regulation is impaired in anxiety and trauma-related disorders. Patients
experience heightened fear expression and reduced ability to extinguish fear
memories. Because fear regulation is abnormal in these disorders and extinction
recapitulates current treatment strategies, understanding the underlying
mechanisms is vital for developing new treatments. This is critical because
although extinction-based exposure therapy is a mainstay of treatment, relapse is
common. We examine recent findings describing changes in network activity and
functional connectivity within limbic circuits during fear regulation, and
explore how activity-dependent signaling contributes to the neural activity
patterns that control fear and anxiety. We review the role of the prototypical
activity-dependent molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose
signaling has been critically linked to regulation of fear behavior.

Pathological Tau is a hallmark of various neuronal disorders and spreads in the
brain of Alzheimer patients in a well-defined manner. Beside Tau's main function 
in stabilizing microtubules for axonal transport, a variety of novel functions
for neurons and glia have emerged recently. Tau regulates the susceptibility to
hyperexcitation and plays a role in neuron-glia contact formation. Studies
implicate soluble oligomeric species of Tau, rather than insoluble aggregates, as
more detrimental to proper neuronal function. Tau is not exclusively
intracellular; instead Tau can be released into the extracellular space. This has
led to the hypothesis of a prion-disease like mechanism to explain the
stereotypical progression of Tau. Targeting pathological Tau with antibodies or
aggregation inhibitors may help to prevent pathology.

In vivo tau imaging allows a deeper understanding of tau deposition in the brain,
providing insights into the causes, diagnosis and treatment of primary and
secondary tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear
palsy, corticobasal syndrome, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and some variants
of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The cross-sectional and longitudinal
assessment of the temporal and spatial patterns of tau deposition in the brain
will allow a better understanding of the role tau plays in ageing as well as its 
relationship with cognition, genotype, and neurodegeneration. It is likely that
selective tau imaging could be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of
disease progression, as well as a surrogate marker for monitoring of efficacy and
patient recruitment for disease-specific therapeutic trials.

Type I interferons (IFN) are pleiotropic cytokines originally described as
molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses
against viral infections. Upon activation, type I IFN can be produced locally in 
the central nervous system (CNS) from a number of different cell types including 
microglia, the CNS-resident macrophages. Increased type I IFN production and
signaling in microglia are critically important to limit viral infection and
disease progression in multiple sclerosis. However, recent findings suggest that 
even baseline levels of constitutive IFN expression and secretion are important
for homeostasis of the CNS. In fact, in the absence of viral particles chronic
elevation of IFN I may be tremendously harmful for the CNS, as assumed for
patients suffering from Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, Cree encephalitis or other
type I interferonopathies. The highly diverse nature of type I IFN for brain
homeostasis during health and disease will be discussed in this report.

Neuropathic pain, which arises from damage to the nervous system, is a major
unmet clinical challenge. Reversing the neuronal hyperexcitability induced by
nerve damage is a logical treatment strategy but has proven frustratingly
difficult. Here, we propose a novel explanation for that difficulty. Changes in
several different ion channels are individually sufficient to cause
hyperexcitability in primary somatosensory neurons. Despite offering multiple
drug targets, this scenario is problematic: if multiple sufficient changes are
triggered by nerve injury, then no single change is necessary for
hyperexcitability. This so-called degeneracy compromises therapeutic
interventions because drug effects on any one ion channel can be circumvented by 
changes occurring in other ion channels. Overcoming degeneracy demands a more
integrative approach to drug discovery.

Intermediate phenotypes (IPs) are defined as measurable liability traits
underlying complex phenotypes, posited to be more genetically tractable than the 
phenotypes themselves. Here we review evidence for cognition as an IP of
psychosis, and highlight topical advances in the literature: first, heritability 
estimation of cognitive abilities using genomewide complex-trait analysis;
second, evidence that cognition lies upstream to schizophrenia liability; third, 
use of polygenic risk scores rather than single genetic variants to examine
genetic overlap between cognitive IPs and schizophrenia; and fourth, use of
cognitive IPs for schizophrenia risk gene discovery and functional
characterization. We end with future directions in using cognitive IPs to study
genetic risk of psychosis, including methodological refinements and shifting
research focus from identifying IPs to using them.

α-Synuclein (αSyn) is a highly abundant neuronal protein whose exact structure
and function are under debate. Misfolding and aggregation of this normally
soluble, 140-residue polypeptide underlies a group of neurodegenerative disorders
called synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB). The αSyn field has focused increasing attention on the
hypotheses that certain aggregates of αSyn may be directly toxic to the neurons
in which they arise and/or that aggregates can be released from some neurons and 
diffuse by undefined mechanisms to other neurons to seed αSyn in the recipient
cells, thus propagating neuropathology by a non-cell autonomous process
('pathogenic spread'). While intense interest in these hypotheses has led to new 
approaches and tools to model aspects of the disorders, it is important to
analyze which molecular events initiate αSyn aggregation inside neurons in the
first place. Here, we review new insights into how neuronal αSyn homeostasis may 
be maintained under physiological conditions but perturbed by pathological
factors.

The search for quantifiable biological mediators of genetic risk or 'intermediate
phenotypes' is an essential strategy in psychiatric neuroscience and a useful
tool for exploring the complex relationships between genes, neural circuits and
behaviors. In recent years, the examination of connectivity-based intermediate
phenotypes has gained increasing popularity in the study of schizophrenia, a
brain disorder that manifests in early adulthood and disturbs a wide range of
neural network functions. To date, several potential connectivity phenotypes have
been identified that link neuroimaging measures of neural circuit interaction to 
genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia. This paper briefly reviews recent
advances, current limitations and future directions in the search for functional 
connectivity intermediate phenotypes for schizophrenia across different cognitive
domains.

Bipolar disorder is a serious psychiatric disorder, with a high heritability and 
unknown pathogenesis. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified the 
first loci, implicating genes such as CACNA1C and ANK3. The genes highlight
several pathways, notably calcium signalling, as being of importance. Molecular
studies suggest that the risk variants impact on gene regulation and expression. 
Preliminary studies using reprogrammed patient-derived cells report alterations
in the transcriptome and in cellular adhesion and differentiation. Mouse models
show that genes involved in circadian biology, acting via dopaminergic effects,
reproduce aspects of the bipolar phenotype. These findings together represent
significant advances in identification of the genetic and molecular basis of
bipolar disorder, yet we are still far from an integrated, evidence-based
understanding of its aetiopathogenesis.

Associative fear learning in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is crucial for an
animal's survival upon environmental threats. BLA neurons are defined on the
basis of their projection target, genetic markers, and associated function. BLA
principal neuron responses to threat signaling stimuli are potentiated upon
associative fear learning, which is tightly controlled by defined interneuron
subpopulations. In addition, BLA population activity correlates with behavioral
states and threat or safety signals. BLA neuronal ensembles activated by
different behavioral signals can be identified using immediate early gene
markers. The next challenge will be to determine the activity patterns and coding
properties of defined BLA ensembles in relation to the whole neuronal population.

Processing of auditory information requires constant adjustment due to
alterations of the environment and changing conditions in the nervous system with
age, health, and experience. Consequently, patterns of activity in cortical
networks have complex dynamics over a wide range of timescales, from milliseconds
to days and longer. In the primary auditory cortex (AI), multiple forms of
adaptation and plasticity shape synaptic input and action potential output.
However, the variance of neuronal responses has made it difficult to characterize
AI receptive fields and to determine the function of AI in processing auditory
information such as vocalizations. Here we describe recent studies on the
temporal modulation of cortical responses and consider the relation of synaptic
plasticity to neural coding.

Learning permits animals to attach meaning and context to sensory stimuli. How
this information is coded in neural networks in the brain, and appropriately
retrieved and utilized to guide behavior, is poorly understood. In the fruit fly 
olfactory memories of particular value are represented within sparse populations 
of odor-activated Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body ensemble. During
learning reinforcing dopaminergic neurons skew the mushroom body network by
driving zonally restricted plasticity at synaptic junctions between the KCs and
subsets of the overall small collection of mushroom body output neurons.
Reactivation of this skewed KC-output neuron network retrieves memory of odor
valence and guides appropriate approach or avoidance behavior.

Evidence of task-specific sensory-independent (TSSI) plasticity from blind and
deaf populations has led to a better understanding of brain organization.
However, the principles determining the origins of this plasticity remain
unclear. We review recent data suggesting that a combination of the connectivity 
bias and sensitivity to task-distinctive features might account for TSSI
plasticity in the sensory cortices as a whole, from the higher-order
occipital/temporal cortices to the primary sensory cortices. We discuss current
theories and evidence, open questions and related predictions. Finally, given the
rapid progress in visual and auditory restoration techniques, we address the
crucial need to develop effective rehabilitation approaches for sensory recovery.

Neural oscillations observed in local field potentials (LFP) represent gross
cellular activity near the recording electrode. Coupling of oscillations in
distributed brain circuits has been proposed to enhance communication across the 
circuits, and the plasticity in oscillatory coupling can underlie flexible task
learning, but the direct evidence has been lacking. Recently, evidence for
plasticity in oscillatory coupling in theta, beta and gamma bands has been
obtained in memory circuits consisted of the hippocampus and its connected areas,
suggesting importance of oscillatory coupling plasticity in memory processing. I 
hypothesize that such plasticity in oscillatory coupling could be a key mechanism
for enhancing inter-regional neural communication, especially in the
entorhinal-hippocampal and prefrontal-hippocampal memory circuits that underlie
formation, control and retrieval of memory.

Memory is the ability to adapt our behavior by using the stored information,
previously encoded. The first investigations of the neuronal bases of the memory 
trace concerned its properties (location, cellular and molecular mechanisms,
among others). However, to understand how this is achieved at the scale of
neurons, we must provide evidence about the necessity of a neuronal subpopulation
to support the memory trace, but also its sufficiency. Here, we will present past
and recent studies that provide information about the neuronal nature of
memories. We will show that research on sleep, when cells assembly supposedly
carrying information from the past are replayed, could also provide valuable
information about the memory processes at stake during wake.

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in organizing the synaptic
interface and regulating synapse activity. In turn, CAMs can influence a variety 
of higher brain functions. In addition to their bona fide interacting partners on
the apposed cell surface or the extracellular matrix (ECM) with which they form
molecular bridges, synaptic CAMs bind to many other proteins with their
intracellular and extracellular domains. The resulting multi-molecular complexes 
at the active zone and at the postsynaptic density (PSD) are thought to anchor
components requisite for synaptic transmission. Recent studies demonstrating the 
proteolytic cleavage of synaptic CAMs underscore an exciting mechanism through
which the synaptic microenvironment can be altered and thereby finely tune the
efficacy of synaptic transmission.

Sensory input is inherently dynamic and redundant. Humans and animals alike show 
a remarkable ability to extract regularities from the sensory scene and
dynamically update their responses to the environment. This type of short-term
plasticity occurs on time scales ranging from seconds to minutes (and possibly
longer). Mismatch Negativity (a component of the human event-related potentials, 
MMN) and Stimulus Specific Adaptation (a single-neuron analogue, SSA) are two
examples of this form of short-term plasticity. Conceptually, both are thought to
express a form of surprise and to represent predictive processing. MMN and SSA
therefore provide us with handles for investigating this important time scale of 
short-term plasticity.

Following loss of input due to peripheral lesions, functional reorganization
occurs in the deprived cortical region in adults. Over a period of hours to
months, cells in the lesion projection zone (LPZ) begin to respond to novel
stimuli. This reorganization is mediated by two processes: a reduction of
inhibition in a gradient throughout the cortex and input remapping via sprouting 
of axonal arbors from cortical regions spatially adjacent to the LPZ, and
strengthening of pre-existing subthreshold inputs. Together these inputs
facilitate receptive field remapping of cells in the LPZ. Recent experiments have
revealed time courses and potential interactions of the mechanisms associated
with functional reorganization, suggesting that large scale reorganization in the
adult may utilize plasticity mechanisms prominent during development.

Neuroscientists spent decades debating whether synaptic plasticity was
presynaptically or postsynaptically expressed. It was eventually concluded that
plasticity depends on many factors, including cell type. More recently, it has
become increasingly clear that plasticity is regulated at an even finer grained
level; it is specific to the synapse type, a concept we denote
synapse-type-specific plasticity (STSP). Here, we review recent developments in
the field of STSP, discussing both long-term and short-term variants and with
particular emphasis on neocortical function. As there are dozens of neocortical
cell types, there is a multiplicity of forms of STSP, the vast majority of which 
have never been explored. We argue that to understand the brain and synaptic
diseases, we have to grapple with STSP.

Sensory loss leads to widespread adaptation of brain circuits to allow an
organism to navigate its environment with its remaining senses, which is broadly 
referred to as cross-modal plasticity. Such adaptation can be observed even in
the primary sensory cortices, and falls into two distinct categories: recruitment
of the deprived sensory cortex for processing the remaining senses, which we term
'cross-modal recruitment', and experience-dependent refinement of the spared
sensory cortices referred to as 'compensatory plasticity.' Here we will review
recent studies demonstrating that cortical adaptation to sensory loss involves
LTP/LTD and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Cross-modal synaptic plasticity is
observed in adults, hence cross-modal sensory deprivation may be an effective way
to promote plasticity in adult primary sensory cortices.

Learning and inferring features that generate sensory input is a task
continuously performed by cortex. In recent years, novel algorithms and learning 
rules have been proposed that allow neural network models to learn such features 
from natural images, written text, audio signals, etc. These networks usually
involve deep architectures with many layers of hidden neurons. Here we review
recent advancements in this area emphasizing, amongst other things, the
processing of dynamical inputs by networks with hidden nodes and the role of
single neuron models. These points and the questions they arise can provide
conceptual advancements in understanding of learning in the cortex and the
relationship between machine learning approaches to learning with hidden nodes
and those in cortical circuits.

A great deal of experimental investment is directed towards questions regarding
the mechanisms of memory storage. Such studies have traditionally been restricted
to investigation of the anatomical structures, physiological processes, and
molecular pathways necessary for the capacity of memory storage, and have avoided
the question of how individual memories are stored in the brain. Memory engram
technology allows the labeling and subsequent manipulation of components of
specific memory engrams in particular brain regions, and it has been established 
that cell ensembles labeled by this method are both sufficient and necessary for 
memory recall. Recent research has employed this technology to probe fundamental 
questions of memory consolidation, differentiating between mechanisms of memory
retrieval from the true neurobiology of memory storage.

Optogenetics has enabled the characterization of the neural circuits involved in 
brain diseases, such as addiction, depression or obsessive compulsive disorders. 
Recently, the technique has also been used to propose blueprints for novel
treatments aiming at restoring circuit function through the reversal of specific 
forms of synaptic plasticity. Since optogenetic manipulations cannot be
immediately translated to human use, we argue that an intermediate strategy could
consist of emulating optogenetic protocols with deep brain stimulation (DBS).
This translational path to rational, optogenetically inspired DBS protocols
starts by refining existing approaches and carries the hope to expand to novel
indications.

Over the past decades studies of the neurobiology of memory were largely
restricted to consideration of cellular and molecular events taking place
immediately or shortly after training, the so-called consolidation period. More
recent views have recognized that the memory process includes sensory processing,
orienting of attention, retrieval, encoding, and subsequent consolidation.
Advances in biotechnology are providing new tools to gain insights at every level
of the memory process. New data from experiments employing high definition fMRI
are confirming the role of the Locus Coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system in
reorienting of attention and in cognitive flexibility. Electrophysiological
studies show new task-related activation of these neurons and learning-related
off line activation and suggest a temporal relationship between LC spiking and
cortical oscillations in the theta and gamma frequencies.

Children around the world successfully adapt to the specific requirements of
their physical and social environment, and they readily acquire any language they
are exposed to. Still, learning simultaneously two languages has been a
continuous concern of parents, educators and scientists. While the focus has
shifted from the possible costs to the possible advantages of bilingualism, the
worries still linger that early bilingualism may cause delays and confusion. Here
we adopt a less dichotomist view, by asking what specific adaptations might
result from simultaneously learning two languages. We will discuss findings that 
point to a surprising plasticity of the cognitive system allowing young infants
to cope with the bilingual input and reaching linguistic milestones at the same
time as monolinguals.

Electronic address: caroni@fmi.ch.

It has recently become possible to investigate connectivities and roles of
identified hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (INs) in behaving rodents. INs
targeting distinct pyramidal neuron subcompartments are recruited dynamically at 
defined phases of behavior and learning. They include Parvalbumin Axo-axonic and 
perisomatic Basket cells, and Somatostatin radiatum-oriens and oriens-lacunosum
moleculare cells. Each IN is in turn either activated or inhibited upon specific 
behavioral and network state requirements through specific inputs and
neuromodulators. Subpopulations of these principal neurons and INs interconnect
selectively, suggesting selective processing and routing of alternate information
streams. First canonical functional modules have emerged, which will have to be
further defined and linked to identified afferents and efferents towards a
circuit understanding of how hippocampal networks support behavior.

Although work in primates on higher-order visual areas has revealed how the
individual and concerted activity of neurons correlates with behavioral reports
of object recognition, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms for
visual recognition memory. Low-level vision, even as early as primary visual
cortex (V1) and even in subjects as unsophisticated as rodents, promises to fill 
this void. Although this latter approach sacrifices interrogation of many of the 
most astounding features of visual recognition, it does provide experimental
constraint, proximity to sensory input, and a wide range of interventional
approaches. The tractability of rodent visual cortex promises to reveal the
molecular mechanisms and circuits that are essential for a fundamental form of
memory.

The transition to motherhood is a dramatic event during the lifetime of many
animals. In mammals, motherhood is accompanied by hormonal changes in the brain
that start during pregnancy, followed by experience dependent plasticity after
parturition. Together, these changes prime the nervous system of the mother for
efficient nurturing of her offspring. Recent work has described how neural
circuits are modified during the transition to motherhood. Here we discuss
changes in the auditory cortex during motherhood as a model for maternal
plasticity in sensory systems. We compare classical plasticity paradigms with
changes that arise naturally in mothers, highlighting current efforts to
establish a mechanistic understanding of plasticity and its different components 
in the context of maternal behavior.

Maturation of cortical inhibition just after eye opening is a necessary precedent
for the emergence of competitive, experience-dependent ocular dominance
plasticity in the visual cortex. What inhibition is doing in this context,
though, is not clear. Here I outline new hypotheses on the roles of somatic and
dendritic inhibition in the opening and closure of critical periods, and their
roles in the competitive processes therein.

In natural environments, neural systems must be continuously updated to reflect
changes in sensory inputs and behavioral goals. Recent studies of sound
localization have shown that adaptation and learning involve multiple mechanisms 
that operate at different timescales and stages of processing, with other sensory
and motor-related inputs playing a key role. We are only just beginning to
understand, however, how these processes interact with one another to produce
adaptive changes at the level of neuronal populations and behavior. Because there
is no explicit map of auditory space in the cortex, studies of sound localization
may also provide much broader insight into the plasticity of complex neural
representations that are not topographically organized.

The critical period for language acquisition is often explored in the context of 
second language acquisition. We focus on a crucially different notion of critical
period for language, with a crucially different time scale: that of a critical
period for first language acquisition. We approach this question by examining the
language outcomes of children who missed their critical period for acquiring a
first language: children who did not receive the required language input because 
they grew in isolation or due to hearing impairment and children whose brain has 
not developed normally because of thiamine deficiency. We find that the
acquisition of syntax in a first language has a critical period that ends during 
the first year of life, and children who missed this window of opportunity later 
show severe syntactic impairments.

Throughout the adult life of all mammals including humans, new neurons are
incorporated to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. During a critical window
that lasts about two weeks, adult-born immature neurons are more excitable and
plastic than mature ones, and they respond to a wider range of inputs. In
apparent contradiction, new neurons have been shown to be crucial to solve
behavioral tasks that involve the discrimination of very similar situations,
which would instead require high input specificity. We propose that immature
neurons are initially unspecific because their task is to identify novel elements
inside a high dimensional input space. With maturation, they would specialize to 
represent details of these novel inputs, favoring discrimination.

Early experience with speech and language, starting in the womb, has been shown
to shape perceptual and learning abilities, paving the way for language
development. Indeed, recent studies suggest that prenatal experience with speech,
which consists mainly of prosodic information, already impacts how newborns
perceive speech and produce communicative sounds. Similarly, the newborn brain
already shows specialization for speech processing, resembling that of the adult 
brain. Yet, newborns' early preparedness for speech is broad, comprising many
universal perceptual abilities. During the first years of life, experience
narrows down speech perception, allowing the child to become a native listener
and speaker. Concomitantly, the neural correlates of speech and language
processing become increasingly specialized.

Waking and sleeping states are privileged periods for distinct mnemonic
processes. In waking behavior, rapid retrieval of previous experience aids
memory-guided decision making. In sleep, a gradual series of reactivated
associations supports consolidation of episodes into memory networks.
Synchronized bursts of hippocampal place cells during events called sharp-wave
ripples communicate associated neural patterns across distributed circuits in
both waking and sleeping states. Differences between sleep and awake sharp-wave
ripples, and in particular the accuracy of recapitulated experience, highlight
their state-dependent roles in memory processes.

Memory formation associates with changes in strength and efficacy of existing
synapses and with the formation of new synapses. Dendritic spines, the membranous
protrusions from neuron dendrites that host the majority of excitatory synapses, 
are the anatomical sites where neuronal activity reshapes brain networks in
response to stimuli. Mounting evidence indicates that structural changes in
fear-remodeled circuits undergo partially erasure following extinction,
suggesting that the changes that persist may serve to reactivate memory. Here we 
review data showing how brain circuits are remodeled at the time fear memory is
formed and extinguished, with a special focus put on the post-extinction
persistence of spine enlargement in relation to memory reactivation.

Hair cells in the mammalian cochlea are specialized sensory cells that convert
mechanical signals evoked by sound waves into electrochemical signals. Several
integral membrane proteins have recently been identified that are closely linked 
to the mechanotransduction process. Efforts are under way to determine the extent
to which they are subunits of the long thought-after mechanotransduction channel.
Recent findings also suggest that mechanotransduction may have a role in fine
tuning the length of the stereocilia and thus in the regulation of morphological 
features of hair cells that are inherently linked to the mechanotransduction
process.

Years of searching and researching have finally yielded a few leads in the quest 
to identify molecules required for mechanosensory transduction in the mammalian
inner ear. Studies of human and mouse genetics have raised the profile of several
molecules that are crucial for the function sensory hair cells. Follow up studies
have begun to define the molecular function and biochemical interactions of
several key proteins. These studies have exposed a sensory transduction apparatus
that is more complex than originally envisioned and have reinvigorated the search
for additional molecular components required for normal inner ear function.

Mosquitoes use their sense of smell to find hosts, nectar, and oviposition sites,
and to avoid repellents. A small number of mosquito species are adapted to feed
on humans and have a major impact on public health by transmitting diseases such 
as malaria, dengue and filariasis. The application of odorants for behavioral
control has not been fully realized yet due to complexity of the mosquito
olfactory system. Recent progress in molecular and computational tools has
enabled rigorous investigations of the mosquito olfactory system function and has
started to reveal how specific receptors contribute to attractive and aversive
behaviors. Here we discuss recent advances in linking odors to receptors and in
exploiting this knowledge in finding attractants and repellents for mosquitoes.

Understanding how sensory stimuli are processed in the brain to instruct
appropriate behavior is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Drosophila has
become a powerful model system to address this problem. Recent advances in
characterizing the circuits underlying pheromone processing have put the field in
a position to follow the transformation of these chemical signals all the way
from the sensory periphery to decision making and motor output. Here we describe 
the latest advances, outline emerging principles of pheromone processing and
discuss future questions.

Drosophila is a powerful model in which to study the molecular and cellular basis
of taste coding. Flies sense tastants via populations of taste neurons that are
activated by compounds of distinct categories. The past few years have borne
witness to studies that define the properties of taste neurons, identifying
functionally distinct classes of sweet and bitter taste neurons that express
unique subsets of gustatory receptor (Gr) genes, as well as water, salt, and
pheromone sensing neurons that express members of the pickpocket (ppk) or
ionotropic receptor (Ir) families. There has also been significant progress in
terms of understanding how tastant information is processed and conveyed to
higher brain centers, and modulated by prior dietary experience or starvation.

An assortment of touch receptors innervate the skin and encode different tactile 
features of the environment. Compared with invertebrate touch and other sensory
systems, our understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of
mammalian touch lags behind. Two recent breakthroughs have accelerated progress. 
First, an arsenal of cell-type-specific molecular markers allowed the functional 
and anatomical properties of sensory neurons to be matched, thereby unraveling a 
cellular code for touch. Such markers have also revealed key roles of
non-neuronal cell types, such as Merkel cells and keratinocytes, in touch
reception. Second, the discovery of Piezo genes as a new family of mechanically
activated channels has fueled the discovery of molecular mechanisms that mediate 
and mechanotransduction in mammalian touch receptors.

Sensory signals are processed in the brain by dedicated neuronal circuits to form
perceptions used to guide behavior. Drosophila, with its compact brain,
amenability to genetic manipulations and sophisticated behaviors has emerged as a
powerful model for investigating the neuronal circuits responsible for sensory
perception. Vision in particular has been examined in detail. Light is detected
in the eye by photoreceptors, specialized neurons containing light sensing
Rhodopsin proteins. These photoreceptor signals are relayed to the optic lobes
where they are processed to gain perceptions about different properties of the
visual scene. In this review we describe recent advances in the characterization 
of neuronal circuits underlying four visual modalities in the fly brain: motion
vision, phototaxis, color and polarized light vision.

As the environmental temperature prominently influences diverse biological
aspects of the animals, thermosensation and the subsequent information processing
in the nervous system has attracted much attention in biology. Thermotaxis in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal behavioral paradigm by which to
address the molecular mechanism underlying thermosensory transduction. Molecular 
genetic analysis in combination with other physiological and behavioral studies
revealed that sensation of ambient temperature is mediated mainly by cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in thermosensory neurons. The
information of the previously perceived temperature is also stored within the
thermosensory neurons, and the consequence of the comparison between the past and
the present temperature is conveyed to the downstream interneurons to further
regulate the motor-circuits that encode the locomotion.

Many cells probe their environment for chemical cues. Some cells respond to
picomolar concentrations of neuropeptides, hormones, pheromones, or
chemoattractants. At such low concentrations, cells encounter only a few
molecules. The mechanistic underpinnings of single-molecule sensitivity are not
known for any eukaryotic cell. Sea urchin sperm offer a unique model to unveil in
quantitative terms the principles underlying chemosensation at the physical
limit. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of such exquisite sensitivity and the
computational operations performed by sperm during chemotactic steering.
Moreover, we highlight commonalities and differences between signalling in sperm 
and photoreceptors and among sperm from different species.

The concept of mammalian pheromones was established decades before the discovery 
of any bioactive ligands. Therefore, their molecular identity, native sources,
and the meaning of their detection has been largely speculative. There has been
recent success in identifying a variety of candidate mouse pheromones and other
specialized odors. These discoveries reveal that mammalian pheromones come in a
variety of ligand types and they are detected by sensory neurons that are pre-set
to promote an array of social and survival behaviors. Importantly, recent
findings show that they activate molecularly diverse sensory neurons that differ 
from canonical odorant detectors. These novel sensory neurons hold future promise
to unlock the mystery of how their detection is hardwired to generate behavior.

Not only is the sense of smell of pivotal importance to most animals but also
serves as a significant model system in biological research. In recent years,
great strides in our understanding of how the olfactory system is organized and
operates have been made. Instrumental in these efforts has been work performed in
Drosophila melanogaster. In spite of the wealth of information gathered, it
remains unclear how the fly's olfactory system is used to decode the chemical
environment. Here we describe recent findings on the chemical ecology of the fly 
and speculate on possible functions of the volatile chemicals that flies detect. 
We argue that for many of the fly's olfactory chemoreceptors, distinct and
ecologically relevant functions can be identified.

Colour vision in the marine environment is on average simpler than in terrestrial
environments with simple or no colour vision through monochromacy or dichromacy. 
Monochromacy is found in marine mammals and elasmobranchs, including whales and
sharks, but not some rays. Conversely, there is also a greater diversity of
colour vision in the ocean than on land, examples being the polyspectral
stomatopods and the many colour vision solutions found among reef fish. Recent
advances in sequencing reveal more opsin (visual pigment) types than functionally
useful at any one time. This diversity arises through opsin duplication and
conversion. Such mechanisms allow pick-and-mix adaptation that tunes colour
vision on a variety of very short non-evolutionary timescales. At least some of
the diversity in marine colour vision is best explained as unconventional colour 
vision or as neutral drift.

The dissection of the Drosophila auditory system has revealed multiple parallels 
between fly and vertebrate hearing. Recent studies have analyzed the operation of
auditory sensory cells and the processing of sound in the fly's brain. Neuronal
responses to sound have been characterized, and novel classes of auditory neurons
have been defined; transient receptor potential (TRP) channels were implicated in
auditory transduction, and genetic and environmental causes of auditory
dysfunctions have been identified. This review discusses the implications of
these recent advances on our understanding of how hearing happens in the fly.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are
progressive retinal diseases that result from the death of rod and cone
photoreceptors, ultimately leading to blindness. The only currently approved
vision restoration treatment employs an implanted retinal 'chip' as a prosthetic 
device to electrically stimulate retinal neurons that survive after the
photoreceptors are gone, thereby restoring light-driven neural signaling to the
brain. Alternative strategies have been proposed, which would utilize optogenetic
or optopharmacological tools to enable direct optical stimulation of surviving
retinal neurons. Here, we review the latest studies evaluating the feasibility of
these molecular tools as potential therapeutics for restoring visual function in 
human blinding disease.

There have been many exciting recent advances in our understanding of the
molecular and cellular basis of itch. These discoveries cover diverse aspects of 
itch sensation, from the identification of new receptors to the characterization 
of spinal cord itch circuits. A common thread of these studies is that they
demonstrate that itch sensory signals are segregated from input for other
somatosensory modalities, such as pain, touch, and thermosensation. This
specificity is achieved by the expression of dedicated receptors and transmitters
in a select population of sensory neurons which detect pruritogens. Further,
recent studies show that itch specificity is maintained in a spinal cord circuit 
by the utilization of specific neurotransmitters and cognate receptors to convey 
input along a distinct cellular pathway.

Organisms continuously evolve to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
Chief among these are daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Relatively
small in terms of real physical values, temperature fluctuations of just a few
degrees can profoundly affect organismal functions. In vertebrates, temperature
is detected by primary afferents of somatosensory neurons, which express
thermo-gated ion channels. Most of our knowledge about temperature receptors
comes from seminal studies in mice and rats. Recent work uncovered thermosensory 
mechanisms in other vertebrates, shedding light onto the diversity of
thermosensory adaptations. Here, we summarize molecular mechanisms of
thermosensation in different species and discuss the need to use the standard
laboratory rodents and non-standard species side-by-side in order to understand
fundamental principles of somatosensation.

In mammals, the perception of smell starts with the activation of odorant
receptors (ORs) by volatile molecules in the environment. The mammalian OR
repertoire has been subject to rapid evolution, and is highly diverse within the 
human population. Recent advances in the functional expression and ligand
identification of ORs allow for functional analysis of OR evolution, and reveal
that changes in OR protein sequences translate into high degrees of functional
variations. Moreover, in several cases the functional variation of a single OR
affects the perception of its cognate odor ligand, providing clues as to how an
odor is coded at the receptor level.

Plants must constantly adapt to a changing light environment in order to optimize
energy conversion through the process of photosynthesis and to limit photodamage.
In addition, plants use light cues for timing of key developmental transitions
such as initiation of reproduction (transition to flowering). Plants are equipped
with a battery of photoreceptors enabling them to sense a very broad light
spectrum spanning from UV-B to far-red wavelength (280-750nm). In this review we 
briefly describe the different families of plant photosensory receptors and the
mechanisms by which they transduce environmental information to influence
numerous aspects of plant growth and development throughout their life cycle.

Phototransduction in Drosophila's microvillar photoreceptors is mediated by
phospholipase C (PLC) resulting in activation of two distinct Ca(2+)-permeable
channels, TRP and TRPL. Here we review recent evidence on the unresolved
mechanism of their activation, including the hypothesis that the channels are
mechanically activated by physical effects of PIP2 depletion on the membrane, in 
combination with protons released by PLC. We also review molecularly explicit
models indicating how Ca(2+)-dependent positive and negative feedback along with 
the ultracompartmentalization provided by the microvillar design can account for 
the ability of fly photoreceptors to respond to single photons 10-100× more
rapidly than vertebrate rods, yet still signal under full sunlight.

Sound is encoded by spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the hearing organ, the
cochlea, with great temporal, spectral and intensity resolution. When hearing
fails, electric stimulation by implanted prostheses can partially restore
hearing. Optical stimulation promises a fundamental advance of hearing
restoration over electric prostheses since light can be conveniently focused and 
hence might dramatically improve frequency resolution of sound encoding.
Combining optogenetic manipulation of neurons with innovative optical stimulation
technology promises versatile spatiotemporal stimulation patterns in the auditory
system. Therefore, using optical stimulation of SGNs also has great potential for
auditory research. Here, I review recent progress in optogenetic stimulation of
the auditory system and its potential for future application in research and
hearing restoration.

In response to seasonal habitats, migratory lepidopterans, exemplified by the
monarch butterfly, have evolved migration to deal with dynamic conditions. During
migration, monarchs use orientation mechanisms, exploiting a time-compensated sun
compass and a light-sensitive inclination magnetic compass to facilitate fall
migration south. The sun compass is bidirectional with overwintering coldness
triggering the change in orientation direction for remigration northward in the
spring. The timing of the remigration and milkweed emergence in the southern US
have co-evolved for propagation of the migration. Current research is uncovering 
the anatomical and molecular substrates that underlie migratory-relevant sensory 
mechanisms with the antennae being critical components. Orientation mechanisms
may be detrimentally affected by environmental factors such as climate change and
sensory interference from human-generated sources.

Over a decade and a half of intensive study has shown that the Transient Receptor
Potential family ion channels TRPV1 and TRPM8 are the primary sensors of heat and
cold temperatures in the peripheral nervous system. TRPV homologues and TRPA1 are
also implicated, but recent genetic evidence has diminished their significance in
thermosensation and suggests that a number of newly identified thermosensitive
channels, including TRPM3, two-pore potassium channels, and the chloride channel 
Ano1, require further consideration. In addition to novel thermostransducers,
recent genetic and pharmacological approaches have begun to elucidate the
afferent neurocircuits underlying temperature sensation, continuing the rapid
expansion in our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of
thermosensation that began with the discovery of TRPV1 and TRPM8.

Animals use thermosensory systems to achieve optimal temperatures for growth and 
reproduction and to avoid damaging extremes. Thermoregulation is particularly
challenging for small animals like the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, whose
body temperature rapidly changes in response to environmental temperature
fluctuation. Recent work has uncovered some of the key molecules mediating fly
thermosensation, including the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels TRPA1 
and Painless, and the Gustatory Receptor Gr28b, an unanticipated thermosensory
regulator normally associated with a different sensory modality. There is also
evidence the Drosophila phototransduction cascade may have some role in
thermosensory responses. Together, the fly's diverse thermosensory molecules act 
in an array of functionally distinct thermosensory neurons to drive a suite of
complex, and often exceptionally thermosensitive, behaviors.

Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are G Protein-Coupled Receptors that
function as vertebrate olfactory receptors. Like odorant receptors, TAARs
constitute an ever-evolving sensory subsystem, with individual TAARs recognizing 
particular chemicals and some evoking stereotyped behaviors. Several TAARs
mediate aversion or attraction towards volatile amines that include the mouse
odor trimethylamine, the predator odor 2-phenylethylamine, and the
death-associated odor cadaverine. TAAR-expressing sensory neurons achieve
monoallelic receptor expression, use canonical olfactory signaling molecules, and
target a dedicated olfactory bulb region. In mouse, TAAR4 and TAAR5 are encoded
by adjacent genes and localize to adjacent glomeruli, yet mediate opposing
behaviors. Future studies are needed to understand how TAAR-expressing sensory
neurons engage higher-order neural circuits to encode odor valence.

Many behaviors necessary for organism survival are learned anew and become
organized as complex sequences of actions. Recent studies suggest that
cortico-basal ganglia circuits are important for chunking isolated movements into
precise and robust action sequences that permit the achievement of particular
goals. During sequence learning many neurons in the basal ganglia develop
sequence-related activity-related to the initiation, execution, and termination
of sequences-suggesting that action sequences are processed as action units.
Corticostriatal plasticity is critical for the crystallization of action
sequences, and for the development of sequence-related neural activity.
Furthermore, this sequence-related activity is differentially expressed in direct
and indirect basal ganglia pathways. These findings have implications for
understanding the symptoms associated with movement and psychiatric disorders.

The striatum is the largest structure of the basal ganglia, receiving synaptic
input from multiple regions including the neocortex, thalamus, external globus
pallidus, and midbrain. Earlier schemes of striatal connectivity presented a
relatively simple architecture which included primarily excitatory input from the
neocortex, dopaminergic input from the midbrain, and intrastriatal connectivity
between projection neurons and a small number of interneuron types. In recent
years this picture has changed, largely due to the introduction of new
experimental methods to reveal cell types and their connectivity. The striatal
microcircuit is now considered to consist of several newly defined neuron types
which are intricately and selectively interconnected. New afferent pathways have 
been discovered, as well as novel properties of previously known afferents such
as the midbrain dopaminergic inputs. In this review we aim to provide a summary
of these recent discoveries.

Recent neurophysiological studies of speaking are beginning to elucidate the
neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback processing during vocalizations.
Here we review how research findings impact our state feedback control (SFC)
model of speech motor control. We will discuss the evidence for cortical
computations that compare incoming feedback with predictions derived from motor
efference copy. We will also review observations from auditory feedback
perturbation studies that demonstrate clear evidence for a state estimate
correction process, which drives compensatory motor behavioral responses. While
there is compelling support for cortical computations in the SFC model, there are
still several outstanding questions that await resolution by future neural
investigations.

Studies of motor learning have largely focussed on the cerebellum, and have
provided key concepts about neural circuits required. However, other parts of the
nervous system are involved in learning, as demonstrated by the capacity to
'train' spinal circuits to produce locomotion following spinal cord injury. While
somatosensory feedback is necessary for spinal motor learning, feed forward
circuits within the spinal cord must also contribute. In fact, motoneurons
themselves could act as comparators that integrate feed forward and feedback
inputs, and thus contribute to motor learning. Application of cerebellar-derived 
principles to spinal circuitry leads to testable predictions of spinal
organization required for motor learning.

primitives, and new data relating primitives to concrete circuit elements across 
species. Both kinematic motor primitives and muscle synergy/kinetic motor
primitives are reviewed. Motor primitives allow a modular hierarchy that may be
re-used by volitional systems in novel ways. They can provide a developmental
bootstrap for ethologically important actions. Collections of primitives somewhat
constrain motor acts, but at the same time sets of primitives facilitate the
rapid construction of these constrained actions, and can allow use of simpler
controls. Novel motor skill likely requires augmentation to transcend the
constraints present in initial collections of low level motor primitives. The
benefits and limitations of motor primitives and the recognized knowledge gaps
and needs for future research are briefly discussed.

Over the recent years, advances in brain imaging, optogenetics and viral tracing 
have greatly advanced our understanding of the cerebellum and its connectivity.
It has become clear that the cerebellum can be divided into functional units,
each connected with particular brain areas involved in specific tasks, allowing
afferent and efferent pathways to process task-specific information. The activity
patterns in these pathways can be widely different among cerebellar areas.
Therefore, it is expected that each cerebellar module is tailored to interpret
inputs with a specific activity profile. In this paper we will review the
evidence for region-specific inputs, region-specific connectivity with the rest
of the brain, and region-specific processing within the cerebellum.

Many earlier human functional MRI (fMRI) studies that investigated the neural
circuits involved in sensorimotor control were motivated by previous non-human
primate (NHP) work and focused on the specialization of brain areas for
particular actions like reaching, grasping and eye movements. More recently,
newer, more sensitive analysis techniques have enabled researchers to move beyond
this simple functional mapping approach and begin exploring a wide range of novel
research questions in humans that have not been well addressed in NHPs. This
work, which we review here, reveals that action-related information is coded
across a much broader range of brain regions than expected from earlier studies
and offers new insights into the highly distributed hierarchical neural
architecture that supports human goal-directed behavior.

Pupil size, as a component of orienting, changes rapidly in response to local
salient events in the environment, in addition to its well-known
illumination-dependent modulation. Recent research has shown that visual,
auditory, or audiovisual stimuli can elicit transient pupil dilation, and the
timing and size of the evoked responses are systematically modulated by stimulus 
salience. Moreover, weak microstimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), a
midbrain structure involved in eye movements and attention, evokes similar
transient pupil dilation, suggesting that the SC coordinates the orienting
response which includes transient pupil dilation. Projections from the SC to the 
pupil control circuitry provide a novel neural substrate underlying pupil
modulation by various cognitive processes.

The cerebellum is connected to cerebral areas that subserve a range of sensory
and motor functions. In this review, we summarize new literature demonstrating
deficits in visual perception, proprioception, motor control, and motor learning 
performance following cerebellar damage. In particular, we highlight novel
results that together suggest a general role of the cerebellum in estimating and 
predicting movement dynamics of the body and environmental stimuli. These
findings agree with the hypothesized role of the cerebellum in the generation and
calibration of predictive models for a variety of functions.

With 302 neurons in the adult Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system, it should be
possible to build models of complex behaviors spanning sensory input to motor
output. The logic of the motor circuit is an essential component of such models. 
Advances in physiological, anatomical, and neurogenetic analysis are revealing a 
surprisingly complex signaling network in the worm's small motor circuit. We are 
progressing towards a systems level dissection of the network of premotor
interneurons, motor neurons, and muscle cells that move the animal forward and
backward in its environment.

Movements are variable. Recent findings in smooth pursuit eye movements provide
an explanation for motor variation in terms of the organization of the brain's
sensory-motor pathways. Variation in sensory estimation is propagated through
sensory-motor circuits and ultimately causes motor variation. The sensory origin 
of motor variation creates trial-by-trial correlations among the responses of
neurons at each level of the sensory motor circuit, and between neural and
behavioral responses. We suggest that motor variation is a compromise between
multiple competing constraints. The brain strives for motor behavior that is
'good enough' in the face of constraints that tend to promote variation.

In both monkeys and humans, motor cognition emerges from a parietal-frontal
network containing discrete dominant domains of visual, eye and hand signals,
where neurons are responsible for goal and effector selection. Within these
domains, the combination of different inputs shape the tuning properties of
neurons, while local and long cortico-cortical connections outline the
architecture of the distributed network and determine the conduction time
underlying eye-hand coordination, necessary for visually guided operations in the
action space. The analysis of the communication timing between parietal and
frontal nodes of the network helps understanding the sensorimotor cortical delays
associated to different functions, such as online control of movement and
eye-hand coordination, and opens a new perspective to the study of the
parieto-frontal interactions.

There is mounting evidence that appropriately timed neuromuscular stimulation can
induce neural plasticity and generate functional recovery from motor disorders.
This review addresses the idea that coordinating stimulation with a patient's
voluntary effort might further enhance neurorehabilitation. Studies in cell
cultures and behaving animals have delineated the rules underlying neural
plasticity when single neurons are used as triggers. However, the rules governing
more complex stimuli and larger networks are less well understood. We argue that 
functional recovery might be optimized if stimulation were modulated by a brain
machine interface, to match the details of the patient's voluntary intent. The
potential of this novel approach highlights the need for a better understanding
of the complex rules underlying this form of plasticity.

Humans possess an impressive ability to generate goal-oriented motor actions to
move and interact with the environment. The planning and initiation of these body
movements is supported by highly distributed cortical and subcortical circuits.
Recent studies, inspired by advanced control theory, highlight similar
sophistication when we make online corrections to counter small disturbances of
the limb or altered visual feedback. Such goal-directed feedback is likely
generated by the same neural circuits associated with motor planning and
initiation. These common neural substrates afford a highly responsive system to
maintain goal-directed control and rapidly select new motor actions as required
to deftly move and interact in a complex world.

In the auditory system, corollary discharge signals are theorized to facilitate
normal hearing and the learning of acoustic behaviors, including speech and
music. Despite clear evidence of corollary discharge signals in the auditory
cortex and their presumed importance for hearing and auditory-guided motor
learning, the circuitry and function of corollary discharge signals in the
auditory cortex are not well described. In this review, we focus on recent
developments in the mouse and songbird that provide insights into the circuitry
that transmits corollary discharge signals to the auditory system and the
function of these signals in the context of hearing and vocal learning.

Multiple distinct learning processes are known to contribute to sensorimotor
adaptation in humans. It is challenging to identify and characterize these
multiple processes, however, because only their summed contribution can typically
be observed. A general strategy for decomposing adaptation into its constituent
components is to exploit their differential susceptibility to specific
experimental manipulations. Several such approaches have recently emerged which, 
taken together, suggest that two fundamental systems operate together to achieve 
the adapted state: one system learns slowly, is implicit, is temporally stable
over short breaks, is expressible at low reaction times, and its properties do
not change based on experience. The second learns rapidly, is explicit, requires 
a long preparation time to be expressed, and exhibits long-term memory for prior 
learning.

Vertebrate locomotion is executed by networks of neurons within the spinal cord. 
Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of spinal locomotor
control provided by work using optical and genetic approaches in mice and
zebrafish. In particular, we highlight common observations that demonstrate
simplification of limb and axial motor pool coordination by spinal network
modularity, differences in the deployment of spinal modules at increasing speeds 
of locomotion, and functional hierarchies in the regulation of locomotor rhythm
and pattern. We also discuss the promise of intersectional genetic strategies for
better resolution of network components and connectivity, which should help us
continue to close the gap between theory and function.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
profoundly impairs corticostriatal information processing. While late stage
pathology includes cell death, the appearance of motor symptoms parallels more
subtle changes in neuronal function and synaptic integration. Because of the
difficulty in modeling the disease and the complexity of the corticostriatal
network, understanding the mechanisms driving pathology has been slow to develop.
In recent years, advances in animal models and network analysis tools have begun 
to shed light on the circuit-specific deficits. These studies have revealed a
progressive impairment of corticostriatal synaptic signaling in subpopulations of
striatal neurons, turning classical excitotoxicity models of HD upside down.
Disrupted brain derived neurotrophic factor signaling appears to be a key factor 
in this decline.

The basal ganglia plays a crucial role in decision-making and control of motion. 
The output of the basal ganglia consists of tonically active GABAergic neurons, a
proportion of which project to different brainstem centres and another part
projecting to thalamus and back to cortex. The focus here is on the former part, 
which keeps the different brainstem motor-centres tonically inhibited under
resting conditions. These centres will be disinhibited when called into action.
In the control of motion the direct pathway will promote movement and the
indirect pathway inhibit competing movement patterns counteracting the
motor-command issued. The basal ganglia detailed structure and function are
conserved throughout the vertebrate evolution, including the afferent (e.g.
habenulae) and efferent control of the dopamine system.

How the brain selects one action among multiple alternatives is a central
question of neuroscience. An influential model is that action preparation and
selection arise from subthreshold activation of the very neurons encoding the
action. Recent work, however, shows a much greater diversity of decision-related 
and action-related signals coexisting with other signals in populations of motor 
and parietal cortical neurons. We discuss how such distributed signals might be
decoded by biologically plausible mechanisms. We also discuss how neurons within 
cortical circuits might interact with each other during action selection and
preparation and how recurrent network models can help to reveal dynamical
principles underlying cortical computation.

The issue of coding of movement in the motor cortex has recently acquired special
significance due to its fundamental importance in neuroprosthetic applications.
The challenge of controlling a prosthetic arm by processed motor cortical
activity has opened a new era of research in applied medicine but has also
provided an 'acid test' for hypotheses regarding coding of movement in the motor 
cortex. The successful decoding of movement information from the activity of
motor cortical cells using their directional tuning and population coding has
propelled successful neuroprosthetic applications and, at the same time, asserted
the utility of those early discoveries, dating back to the early 1980s.

The planning and execution of both discrete voluntary movements and visually
guided locomotion depends on the contribution of multiple cortical areas. In this
review, we discuss recent experiments that address the contribution of the
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the motor cortex to the control of
locomotion. The results from these experiments show that the PPC contributes to
the planning of locomotion by providing an estimate of the position of an animal 
with respect to objects in its path. In contrast, the motor cortex contributes
primarily to the execution of gait modifications by modulating the activity of
groups of synergistic muscles active at different times during the gait cycle.

Mammalian skilled forelimb movements are remarkable in their precision, a feature
that emerges from the continuous adjustment of motor output. Here we discuss
recent progress in bridging the gap between theory and neural implementation in
understanding the basis of forelimb motor refinement. One influential theory is
that feedback from internal copy motor pathways enables fast prediction, through 
a forward model of the limb, an idea supported by behavioral studies that have
explored how forelimb movements are corrected online and can adapt to changing
conditions. In parallel, neural substrates of forelimb internal copy pathways are
coming into clearer focus, in part through the use of genetically tractable
animal models to isolate spinal and cerebellar circuits and explore their
contributions to movement.

Modern approaches, including high performance video, neurophysiology, and
neurogenetics, allow to analyze invertebrate behavior on all levels of generation
and performance in an unprecedented way. They allow observation and
classification of behavior in controlled conditions, dissection of behavioral
sequencing, identification of levels of processing and locations of associated
sub-networks and, finally, identification of neuronal components and topologies
contributing to specific aspects of behaviors. Recently conceptual and
methodological progress has contributed to unraveling the neural structures
underlying descending control of insect behavior as well as the mechanisms in
charge of generating coordinated locomotor movements of the invertebrate
extremities during walking. This brief review summarizes some of the most
exciting new findings in these areas of research from the past years.

Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine that powerfully modulates spinal motor control by
acting on intrasynaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Here we review the diversity
of 5-HT actions on locomotor and motoneuronal activities. Two approaches have
been used on in vitro spinal cord preparations: either applying 5-HT in the
extracellular medium or inducing its synaptic release. They produced strikingly
different results suggesting that the net effect of 5-HT depends on the identity 
of the activated receptors and their location. Recent findings suggest that
moderate release of 5-HT facilitates locomotion and promotes the excitability of 
motoneurons, while stronger release inhibits rhythmic activity and motoneuron
firing. This latter effect is responsible for central fatigue and secures
rotation of motor units.

New technologies for monitoring and manipulating the nervous system promise
exciting biology but pose challenges for analysis and computation. Solutions can 
be found in the form of modern approaches to distributed computing, machine
learning, and interactive visualization. But embracing these new technologies
will require a cultural shift: away from independent efforts and proprietary
methods and toward an open source and collaborative neuroscience.

Recording neuronal activity in behaving subjects has been instrumental in
studying how information is represented and processed by the brain. Recent
advances in optical imaging and bioengineering have converged to enable
time-lapse, cell-type specific recordings of neuronal activities from large
neuronal populations in deep-brain structures of freely behaving rodents. We will
highlight these advancements, with an emphasis on miniaturized integrated
microscopy for large-scale imaging in freely behaving mice. This technology
potentially enables studies that were difficult to perform using previous
generation imaging and current electrophysiological techniques. These studies
include longitudinal and population-level analyses of neuronal representations
associated with different types of naturalistic behaviors and cognitive or
emotional processes.

Technological advances have dramatically expanded our ability to probe
multi-neuronal dynamics and connectivity in the brain. However, our ability to
extract a simple conceptual understanding from complex data is increasingly
hampered by the lack of theoretically principled data analytic procedures, as
well as theoretical frameworks for how circuit connectivity and dynamics can
conspire to generate emergent behavioral and cognitive functions. We review and
outline potential avenues for progress, including new theories of high
dimensional data analysis, the need to analyze complex artificial networks, and
methods for analyzing entire spaces of circuit models, rather than one model at a
time. Such interplay between experiments, data analysis and theory will be
indispensable in catalyzing conceptual advances in the age of large-scale
neuroscience.

Neuroscience would be revolutionized by a technique to measure intracellular
electrical potentials that would not disrupt cellular physiology and could be
massively parallelized. Though such a technology does not yet exist, the
technical hurdles for fabricating minimally disruptive, solid-state electrical
probes have arguably been overcome in the field of nanotechnology. Nanoscale
devices can be patterned with features on the same length scale as biological
components, and several groups have demonstrated that nanoscale electrical probes
can measure the transmembrane potential of electrogenic cells. Developing these
nascent technologies into robust intracellular recording tools will now require a
better understanding of device-cell interactions, especially the
membrane-inorganic interface. Here we review the state-of-the art in
nanobioelectronics, emphasizing the characterization and design of stable
interfaces between nanoscale devices and cells.

Our brain is organized in a modular structure. Information in different
modalities is processed within distinct cortical areas. However, individual
cortical areas cannot enable complex cognitive functions without interacting with
other cortical areas. Electrocorticography (ECoG) has recently become an
important tool for studying global network activity across cortical areas in
animal models. With stable recordings of electrical field potentials from
multiple cortical areas, ECoG provides an opportunity to systematically study
large-scale cortical activity at a mesoscopic spatiotemporal resolution under
various experimental conditions. Recent developments in thin, flexible ECoG
electrodes permit recording field potentials from not only gyral but intrasulcal 
cortical surfaces. Our review here focuses on the recent advances of ECoG
applications to non-human primates.

Neural computations are implemented by activity in spatially distributed neural
circuits. Cellular imaging fills a unique niche in linking activity of specific
types of neurons to behavior, over spatial scales spanning single neurons to
entire brain regions, and temporal scales from milliseconds to months. Imaging
may soon make it possible to track activity of all neurons in a brain region,
such as a cortical column. We review recent methodological advances that
facilitate optical imaging of neuronal populations in vivo, with an emphasis on
calcium imaging using protein indicators in mice. We point out areas that are
particularly ripe for future developments.

The goal of the Human Brain Project is to develop, during the next decade, an
infrastructure capable of simulating a draft human brain model based on available
experimental data. One of the key issues is therefore to integrate and make
accessible the experimental data necessary to constrain and fully specify this
model. The required data covers many different spatial scales, ranging from the
molecular scale to the whole brain and these data are obtained using a variety of
techniques whose measurements may not be directly comparable. Furthermore, these 
data are incomplete, and will remain so at least for the coming decade. Here we
review new neuroinformatics techniques that need to be developed and applied to
address these issues.

Astrocytes are highly ramified glial cells found throughout the central nervous
system (CNS). They express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors that can
induce widespread chemical excitation, placing these cells in an optimal position
to exert global effects on brain physiology. However, the activity patterns of
only a small fraction of astrocytes have been examined and techniques to
manipulate their behavior are limited. As a result, little is known about how
astrocytes modulate CNS function on synaptic, microcircuit, or systems levels.
Here, we review current and emerging approaches for visualizing and manipulating 
astrocyte activity in vivo. Deciphering how astrocyte network activity is
controlled in different physiological and pathological contexts is crucial for
defining their roles in the healthy and diseased CNS.

Technological advances in experimental neuroscience are generating vast
quantities of data, from the dynamics of single molecules to the structure and
activity patterns of large networks of neurons. How do we make sense of these
voluminous, complex, disparate and often incomplete data? How do we find general 
principles in the morass of detail? Computational models are invaluable and
necessary in this task and yield insights that cannot otherwise be obtained.
However, building and interpreting good computational models is a substantial
challenge, especially so in the era of large datasets. Fitting detailed models to
experimental data is difficult and often requires onerous assumptions, while more
loosely constrained conceptual models that explore broad hypotheses and
principles can yield more useful insights.

The dense connectivity in the brain means that one neuron's activity can
influence many others. To observe this interconnected system comprehensively, an 
aspiration within neuroscience is to record from as many neurons as possible at
the same time. There are two useful routes toward this goal: one is to expand the
spatial extent of functional imaging techniques, and the second is to use animals
with small brains. Here we review recent progress toward imaging many neurons and
complete populations of identified neurons in small vertebrates and
invertebrates.

Brain activity reveals exquisite coordination across spatial scales, from local
microcircuits to brain-wide networks. Understanding how the brain represents,
transforms and communicates information requires simultaneous recordings from
distributed nodes of whole brain networks with single-cell resolution. Realizing 
multi-site recordings from communicating populations is hampered by the need to
isolate clusters of interacting cells, often on a day-to-day basis. Chronic
implantation of multi-electrode arrays allows long-term tracking of activity.
Lithography on thin films provides a means to produce arrays of variable
resolution, a high degree of flexibility, and minimal tissue displacement.
Sequential application of surface arrays to monitor activity across brain-wide
networks and subsequent implantation of laminar arrays to target specific
populations enables continual refinement of spatial scale while maintaining
coverage.

Local field potential (LFP) activity in motor cortical and basal ganglia regions 
exhibits prominent beta (15-40Hz) oscillations during reaching and grasping,
muscular contraction, and attention tasks. While in vitro and computational work 
has revealed specific mechanisms that may give rise to the frequency and duration
of this oscillation, there is still controversy about what behavioral processes
ultimately drive it. Here, simultaneous behavioral and large-scale neural
recording experiments from non-human primate and human subjects are reviewed in
the context of specific hypotheses about how beta band activity is generated.
Finally, a new experimental paradigm utilizing operant conditioning combined with
motor tasks is proposed as a way to further investigate this oscillation.

One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale
electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system is
'open' or 'closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics and source
code are available to end users. Open systems have a reputation for being
difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival
of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and
web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be
reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular
electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples
of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to
promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant
development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that
connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers 
the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to
continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by
commercial vendors.

The activity of sensory neurons is modulated by non-sensory influences, but the
role of these influences in cognition is only partially understood. Here we
review how the large-scale recording of neuronal activity within and across brain
regions allows researchers to examine the interactions between simultaneously
recorded neurons as they are jointly influenced by fluctuations in an animal's
mental state. We focus on studies on the visual cortex of non-human primates to
examine the relationship between extra-retinal influences and beliefs about the
state of the sensory world. We explore how these influences can be understood
within theoretical frameworks that propose how the continuous updating of belief 
states supports perceptual inference.

Our ability to collect large amounts of data from many cells has been paralleled 
by the development of powerful statistical models for extracting information from
this data. Here we discuss how the activity of cell assemblies can be analyzed
using these models, focusing on the generalized linear models and the maximum
entropy models and describing a number of recent studies that employ these tools 
for analyzing multi-neuronal activity. We show results from simulations comparing
inferred functional connectivity, pairwise correlations and the real synaptic
connections in simulated networks demonstrating the power of statistical models
in inferring functional connectivity. Further development of network
reconstruction techniques based on statistical models should lead to more
powerful methods of understanding functional anatomy of cell assemblies.

Extracellular, large scale in vivo recording of neural activity is mandatory for 
elucidating the interaction of neurons within large neural networks at the level 
of their single unit activity. Technological achievements in MEMS-based
multichannel electrode arrays offer electrophysiological recording capabilities
that go far beyond those of classical wire electrodes. Despite their impressive
channel counts, recording systems with modest interconnection overhead have been 
demonstrated thanks to the hybrid integration of CMOS circuitry for signal
preprocessing and data handling. The number of addressable channels is increased 
even further by a switch matrix for electrode selection co-integrated along the
slender probe shafts. When realized by IC fabrication technologies, these probes 
offer highest recording site densities along the entire shaft length.

Human fMRI studies have identified well-reproducible resting-state networks (RSN)
from spontaneous recordings. These networks are extracted from correlation
metrics across the brain using several minutes of data. However, a majority of
electrophysiological events occur at a sub-second time scale and their
contribution to RSN generation is likely. According to recent fMRI studies RSNs
separate into smaller networks when studied with higher temporal resolution.
Moreover, using simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI recordings it was shown
that transient functional networks form around neural events. Therefore,
considering neural events as sources of functional networks might improve the
understanding of spontaneous brain activity. This endeavor will benefit from
technical advances in simultaneous BOLD and electrophysiology recordings, as well
as a more principled modeling of neurovascular coupling.

The large capacity of episodic memory is thought to be supported by the emergence
of distinct hippocampal cell assemblies for unrelated memories, such that
interference is minimized. In large-scale population recordings, the orthogonal
nature of hippocampal representations across environments is evident in the
complete reorganization of the firing locations of hippocampal place cells.
Entorhinal grid cells provide inputs to the hippocampus, and their firing
patterns shift relative to each other across different environments. Although
this suggests that altered grid cell firing could generate distinct hippocampal
population codes, it has recently been shown that new and distinct hippocampal
place fields emerge while grid cell firing is compromised. We therefore propose
that separate circuits within the medial entorhinal cortex are specialized for
performing either spatial or memory-related computations.

Tolman proposed that complex animal behavior is mediated by the cognitive map, an
integrative learning system that allows animals to reconfigure previous
experience in order to compute predictions about the future. The discovery of
place cells in the rodent hippocampus immediately suggested a plausible neural
mechanism to fulfill the 'map' component of Tolman's theory. Recent work
examining hippocampal representations occurring at fast time scales suggests that
these sequences might be important for supporting the inferential mental
operations associated with the cognitive map function. New findings that
hippocampal sequences play an important causal role in mediating adaptive
behavior on a moment-by-moment basis suggest specific neural processes that may
underlie Tolman's cognitive map framework.

Over the last several years, technological advances have enabled researchers to
more readily observe single-cell membrane biophysics in awake, behaving animals. 
Studies utilizing these technologies have provided important insights into the
mechanisms generating functional neural codes in both sensory and non-sensory
cortical circuits. Crucial for a deeper understanding of how membrane biophysics 
control circuit dynamics however, is a continued effort to move toward large
scale studies of membrane biophysics, in terms of the numbers of neurons and ion 
channels examined. Future work faces a number of theoretical and technical
challenges on this front but recent technological developments hold great promise
for a larger scale understanding of how membrane biophysics contribute to circuit
coding and computation.

Two general classes of hypotheses for the role for gamma oscillations in
sensation are those that predict gamma facilitates signal amplification through
local synchronization of a distinct ensemble, and those that predict gamma
modulates fine temporal relationships between neurons to represent information.
Correlative evidence has been offered for and against these hypotheses. A recent 
study in which gamma was optogenetically entrained by driving fast-spiking
interneurons showed enhanced sensory detection of harder-to-perceive stimuli,
those that benefit most from attention, in agreement with the amplification
hypotheses. These findings are supported by similar studies employing less
specific optogenetic patterns or single neuron stimulation, but contrast with
findings based on direct optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal neurons. Key next
steps for this topic are described.

Coupled oscillations are hypothesized to organize the processing of information
across distributed brain circuits. This idea is supported by recent evidence, and
newly developed techniques promise to put such theoretical framework to
mechanistic testing. We review evidence suggesting that individual oscillatory
cycles constitute a functional unit that organizes activity in neural networks,
and that oscillatory phase (defined as the fraction of the wave cycle that has
elapsed relative to the start of the cycle) is a key oscillatory parameter to
implement the functions of oscillations in limbic networks. We highlight neural
manipulation techniques that currently allow for causal testing of these
hypotheses.

The spinal cord of all vertebrates contains the networks that coordinate the
locomotor movements. In lamprey, zebrafish and amphibian tadpoles these networks 
generate the swimming movements and depend primarily on ipsilateral excitatory
premotor interneurons of the V2a type (zebrafish) generate the segmental burst
pattern. In zebrafish they can be further subdivided into three subclasses
activating slow, intermediate and fast muscle fibers. Inhibitory commissural
neurons are responsible for the alternating pattern between the two sides of the 
body. Stretch receptor neurons sense the movements and provide sensory feedback. 
In mammals the locomotor pattern in each limb comprises four different phases
including flexor-extensor alternation. Also in this case local ipsilateral
excitatory V2 interneurons can drive rhythmic burst activity in individual muscle
groups. The coordination between the two hind limbs appears to be controlled by
separate sets of commissural interneurons (V0) most likely engaged in walk, trot 
and gallop respectively.

Our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms behind epilepsy dynamics has
recently advanced due to the application of novel technologies, monitoring
hundreds of neurons with single cell resolution. These developments have provided
new theories on the relationship between physiological and pathological states,
as well as common motifs for the propagation of paroxysmal activity. Although
traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings continue to describe normal
network oscillations and abnormal epileptic events within and outside of the
seizure focus, analysis of epilepsy dynamics at the microscale has found
variability in the composition of macroscopically repetitive epileptiform events.
These novel results point to heterogeneity in the underlying dynamics of the
disorder, highlighting both the need and potential for more specific and targeted
therapies.

Neuronal oscillations present potential physiological substrates for brain
operations that require temporal prediction. We review this idea in the context
of auditory perception. Using speech as an exemplar, we illustrate how
hierarchically organized oscillations can be used to parse and encode complex
input streams. We then consider the motor system as a major source of rhythms
(temporal priors) in auditory processing, that act in concert with attention to
sharpen sensory representations and link them across areas. We discuss the
circuits that could mediate this audio-motor interaction, notably the potential
role of the somatosensory system. Finally, we reposition temporal predictions in 
the context of internal models, discussing how they interact with feature-based
or spatial predictions. We argue that complementary predictions interact
synergistically according to the organizational principles of each sensory
system, forming multidimensional filters crucial to perception.

Current research on spontaneous, self-generated brain rhythms and dynamic neural 
network coordination cast new light on Immanuel Kant's idea of the 'spontaneity' 
of cognition, that is, the mind's capacity to organize and synthesize sensory
stimuli in novel, unprecedented ways. Nevertheless, determining the precise
nature of the brain-cognition mapping remains an outstanding challenge.
Neurophenomenology, which uses phenomenological information about the variability
of subjective experience in order to illuminate the variability of brain
dynamics, offers a promising method for addressing this challenge.

Brains are dynamic systems, consisting of huge number of massively interconnected
elementary components. The activity of these components results in an initial
condition-sensitive evolution of network states through highly non-linear,
probabilistic interactions. The dynamics of such systems cannot be described
merely by studying the behavior of their components; instead their study benefits
from employing multimodal methods. Neural-Event-Triggered (NET) fMRI is a novel
method allowing identification of events that can be used to examine
multi-structure activity in the brain. First results offered insights into the
networks that might be involved in memory consolidation. On-going work examines
the physiological underpinnings of the up and down modulation of metabolic
activity, mapped with this methodology.

Models of information transmission in the brain largely rely on firing rate
codes. The abundance of oscillatory activity in the brain suggests that
information may be also encoded using the phases of ongoing oscillations. Sensory
perception, working memory and spatial navigation have been hypothesized to use
phase codes, and cross-frequency coordination and phase synchronization between
brain areas have been proposed to gate the flow of information. Phase codes
generally require the phase of the oscillations to be reset at specific reference
points for consistent coding, and coordination between oscillators requires
favorable phase resetting characteristics. Recent evidence supports a role for
neural oscillations in providing temporal reference windows that allow for
correct parsing of phase-coded information.

What distinguishes animals from robots is the neurodynamics of intention. The
mechanism is the action-perception cycle that creates and applies knowledge.
Knowledge is the condensed, categorized information brains accumulate over
lifetimes of experience. Vertebrate intention emerged in the Ordovician period as
a tool to prowl first olfactory environments, then environments of other
modalities. Action necessitates remembering space-time trajectories. Hence the
sensory, motor, and hippocampal cortices interact intimately. Brains create the
contextual richness of relevant knowledge almost instantly by exploiting the
capacity of cortical neuropil to transit between a gas-like phase with sparse,
random firing and a liquid-liked phase of high-energy, narrow band oscillation
synchronized widely. They express remembrances in spatial patterns of amplitude
modulation (AM) of beta and gamma waves.

Gamma-band (25-140Hz) oscillations are ubiquitous in mammalian forebrain
structures involved in sensory processing, attention, learning and memory. The
optic tectum (OT) is the central structure in a midbrain network that
participates critically in controlling spatial attention. In this review, we
summarize recent advances in characterizing a neural circuit in this midbrain
network that generates large amplitude, space-specific, gamma oscillations in the
avian OT, both in vivo and in vitro. We describe key physiological and
pharmacological mechanisms that produce and regulate the structure of these
oscillations. The extensive similarities between midbrain gamma oscillations in
birds and those in the neocortex and hippocampus of mammals, offer important
insights into the functional significance of a midbrain gamma oscillatory code.

Mathematical approaches are reviewed to interpret intermittent singular
space-time dynamics observed in brain imaging experiments. The following aspects 
of brain dynamics are considered: nonlinear dynamics (chaos), phase transitions, 
and criticality. Probabilistic cellular automata and random graph models are
described, which develop equations for the probability distributions of
macroscopic state variables as an alternative to differential equations. The
introduced modular neuropercolation model is motivated by the multilayer
structure and dynamical properties of the cortex, and it describes critical brain
oscillations, including background activity, narrow-band oscillations in
excitatory-inhibitory populations, and broadband oscillations in the cortex.
Input-induced and spontaneous transitions between states with large-scale
synchrony and without synchrony exhibit brief episodes with long-range spatial
correlations as observed in experiments.

The communication-through-coherence (CTC) hypothesis proposes that anatomical
connections are dynamically rendered effective or ineffective through the
presence or absence of rhythmic synchronization, in particular in the gamma and
beta bands. The original CTC statement proposed that uni-directional
communication is due to rhythmic entrainment with an inter-areal delay and a
resulting non-zero phase relation, whereas bi-directional communication is due to
zero-phase synchronization. Recent studies found that inter-areal gamma-band
synchronization entails a non-zero phase lag. We therefore modify the CTC
hypothesis and propose that bi-directional cortical communication is realized
separately for the two directions by uni-directional CTC mechanisms entailing
delays in both directions. We review evidence suggesting that inter-areal
influences in the feedforward and feedback directions are segregated both
anatomically and spectrally.

Fluctuating oscillations are a ubiquitous feature of neurophysiology. Are the
amplitude fluctuations of neural oscillations chance excursions drawn randomly
from a normal distribution, or do they tell us more? Recent empirical research
suggests that the occurrence of 'anomalous' (high amplitude) oscillations imbues 
their probability distributions with a heavier tail than the standard normal
distribution. However, not all heavy tails are the same. We provide canonical
examples of different heavy-tailed distributions in cortical oscillations and
discuss the corresponding mechanisms that each suggest, ranging from criticality 
to multistability, memory, bifurcations, and multiplicative noise. Their
existence suggests that the brain is a strongly correlated complex system that
employs many different functional mechanisms, and that likewise, we as scientists
should refrain from methodological monism.

Small central pattern generating circuits found in invertebrates have significant
advantages for the study of the circuit mechanisms that generate brain rhythms.
Experimental and computational studies of small oscillatory circuits reveal that 
similar rhythms can arise from disparate mechanisms. Animal-to-animal variation
in the properties of single neurons and synapses may underly robust circuit
performance, and can be revealed by perturbations. Neuromodulation can produce
altered circuit performance but also ensure reliable circuit function.

The analysis of single trial responses of field potentials is an important tool
to study brain signals. Single trial analyses can indeed provide additional
information that is obscured or simply not available in the average responses.
The importance of studying single trial responses is reinforced by the fact that 
different brain processes are correlated with trial-by-trial variation of the
responses. Here, we review key studies implementing single trial analyses of
field potentials-using methods such as single trial latency, amplitude and power 
changes, spike and LFP relationships, correlations between areas, cross frequency
coupling, decoding of the presented stimuli-that bring light into the neural
basis of perception, learning and memory.

Neural oscillations are ubiquitous in olfactory systems of mammals, insects and
molluscs. Neurophysiological and computational investigations point to common
mechanisms for gamma or odor associated oscillations across phyla (40-100Hz in
mammals, 20-30Hz in insects, 0.5-1.5Hz in molluscs), engaging the reciprocal
dendrodendritic synapse between excitatory principle neurons and inhibitory
interneurons in the olfactory bulb (OB), antennal lobe (AL), or procerebrum
(PrC). Recent studies suggest important mechanisms that may modulate gamma
oscillations, including neuromodulators and centrifugal input to the OB and AL.
Beta (20Hz) and theta (2-12Hz) oscillations coordinate activity within and across
brain regions. Olfactory beta oscillations are associated with odor learning and 
depend on centrifugal OB input, while theta oscillations are strongly associated 
with respiration.

Cortical and thalamocortical activity is highly state dependent, varying between 
patterns that are conducive to accurate sensory-motor processing, to states in
which the brain is largely off-line and generating internal rhythms irrespective 
of the outside world. The generation of rhythmic activity occurs through the
interaction of stereotyped patterns of connectivity together with intrinsic
membrane and synaptic properties. One common theme in the generation of rhythms
is the interaction of a positive feedback loop (e.g., recurrent excitation) with 
negative feedback control (e.g., inhibition, adaptation, or synaptic depression).
The operation of these state-dependent activities has wide ranging effects from
enhancing or blocking sensory-motor processing to the generation of pathological 
rhythms associated with psychiatric or neurological disorders.

High density scalp EEG and subdural ECoG recordings provide an opportunity to map
the electrical activity of the cortex with high spatial resolution. The spatial
power spectral densities conform to a power law distribution with some nonlinear 
variations. The spatiotemporal patterns of phase derived from these data sets
have unique features, such as, amplitude and phase modulation waves and also
exhibited formation of spatial phase cluster patterns. These unique features
represent different cognitive states and are different between normal and
diseased states. Reported results show that the rate of formation of phase
cluster patterns derived from the seizure-free interictal EEG data are higher in 
epileptogenic zones as compared with nearby normal areas of the brain.

Despite considerable effort over a century and the benefit of remarkable
technical advances in the past few decades, we are still far from understanding
mammalian cerebral neocortex. With its six layers, modular architecture,
canonical circuits, innumerable cell types, and computational complexity,
isocortex remains a challenging mystery. In this review, we argue that
identifying the structural and functional similarities between mammalian piriform
cortex and reptilian dorsal cortex could help reveal common organizational and
computational principles and by extension, some of the most primordial
computations carried out in cortical networks.

Brain signals often show fluctuations in particular frequency bands, which are
highly conserved across species and are associated with specific behavioural
states. Such rhythmic patterns can be captured in the local field potential
(LFP), which is obtained by low-pass filtering the extracellular signal recorded 
from microelectrodes. However, LFP also captures other neural processes that are 
associated with spikes, such as synaptic events preceding a spike, low-frequency 
component of the action potential ("spike bleed-through") and spike
afterhyperpolarization, which pose difficulties in the estimation of the
amplitude and phase of the rhythm with respect to spikes. Here we discuss these
issues and different techniques that have been used to dissociate the rhythm from
other neural events in the LFP.

Human intracranial high-frequency activity during memory processing: neural

Intracranial high-frequency activity (HFA), which refers to fast fluctuations in 
electrophysiological recordings, increases during memory processing. Two views
have emerged to explain this effect: (1) HFA reflects a synchronous signal,
related to underlying gamma oscillations, that plays a mechanistic role in human 
memory and (2) HFA reflects an asynchronous signal that is a non-specific marker 
of brain activation. We review recent data supporting each of these views and
conclude that HFA during memory processing is more consistent with an
asynchronous signal. Memory-related HFA is therefore best conceptualized as a
biomarker of neural activation that can functionally map memory with high spatial
and temporal precision.

There has been a revived interest in the impact of electric fields on neurons and
networks. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how endogenous
and externally imposed electric fields impact brain function at different spatial
(from synapses to single neurons and neural networks) and temporal scales (from
milliseconds to seconds). How such ephaptic effects are mediated and manifested
in the brain remains a mystery. We argue that it is both possible (based on
available technologies) and worthwhile to vigorously pursue such research as it
has significant implications on our understanding of brain processing and for
translational neuroscience.

Rhythmic activity appears in the auditory cortex in both microscopic and
macroscopic observables and is modulated by both bottom-up and top-down
processes. How this activity serves both types of processes is largely unknown.
Here we review studies that have recently improved our understanding of potential
functional roles of large-scale global dynamic activity patterns in auditory
cortex. The experimental paradigm of auditory category learning allowed critical 
testing of the hypothesis that global auditory cortical activity states are
associated with endogenous cognitive states mediating the meaning associated with
an acoustic stimulus rather than with activity states that merely represent the
stimulus for further processing.

GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus coordinate neuronal activity that gives
rise to network oscillations. In this article we present advances in our
understanding of how different classes of hippocampal interneurons contribute to 
distinct hippocampal network oscillations. We focus on two main experimental
approaches that were recently applied in awake animals. Firstly, we review
experiments in which selective activation or inhibition of subgroups of GABAergic
interneurons was used to asses their contribution to network oscillations.
Secondly, we present work that provides a first characterization of the firing
activity of anatomically identified interneurons in the hippocampus of behaving
animals.

During non-REM sleep the EEG is dominated by slow waves which result from
synchronized UP and DOWN states in the component neurons of the thalamocortical
network. This review focuses on four areas of recent progress in our
understanding of these events. Thus, it has now been conclusively demonstrated
that the full expression of slow waves, both of natural sleep and anesthesia,
requires an essential contribution by the thalamus. Furthermore, the modulatory
role of brainstem transmitters, the function of cortical inhibition and the
relative contribution of single neocortical neurons to EEG slow waves have
started to be carefully investigated. Together, these new data confirm the view
that a full understanding of slow waves can only be achieved by considering the
thalamocortical network as a single functional and dynamic unit for the
generation of this key EEG rhythm.

Chaotic itinerancy is an autonomously excited trajectory through high-dimensional
state space of cortical neural activity that causes the appearance of a temporal 
sequence of quasi-attractors. A quasi-attractor is a local region of weakly
convergent flows that represent ordered activity, yet connected to divergent
flows representing disordered, chaotic activity between the regions. In a
cognitive neurodynamic aspect, quasi-attractors represent perceptions, thoughts
and memories, chaotic trajectories between them with intelligent searches, such
as history-dependent trial-and-error via exploration, and itinerancy with
history-dependent sequences in thinking, speaking and writing.

Top-down processing in the neocortex underlies important cognitive functions such
as predictive coding and attentional set. We review evidence indicating that
top-down neocortical processes are carried by interareal synchrony, particularly 
in the beta frequency band. We hypothesize that top-down neocortical signals in
the beta band convey behavioral context to low-level sensory neurons. We further 
speculate that large-scale distributed networks, self-organized at the highest
hierarchical levels, are the source of top-down signals in the neocortex.

Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed to coordinate neural dynamics
across spatial and temporal scales. Despite its potential relevance for
understanding healthy and pathological brain function, the standard CFC analysis 
and physiological interpretation come with fundamental problems. For example,
apparent CFC can appear because of spectral correlations due to common
non-stationarities that may arise in the total absence of interactions between
neural frequency components. To provide a road map towards an improved
mechanistic understanding of CFC, we organize the available and potential novel
statistical/modeling approaches according to their biophysical interpretability. 
While we do not provide solutions for all the problems described, we provide a
list of practical recommendations to avoid common errors and to enhance the
interpretability of CFC analysis.

For decades, theta rhythms (∼5-10Hz) have been thought to play a critical role in
memory processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal network. However, recent evidence
suggests that successful memory performance also requires coupling of ∼30-100Hz
gamma rhythms to particular phases of the theta cycle. Recent insights imply ways
in which theta-gamma coupling may facilitate transfer of information throughout
the entorhinal-hippocampal network. Activating gamma-modulated cell assemblies at
a particular theta phase may allow the network to produce a more powerful output 
by ensuring that distributed cells fire closely in time. I hypothesize that such 
a mechanism would serve to facilitate either memory encoding or memory retrieval,
depending on which type of gamma rhythms are recruited.

Network oscillations are present throughout the mammalian brain. They are
important for certain cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. The
hippocampus exhibits prominent oscillations similar to those seen in other parts 
of the cortex. Due to its highly organised lamellar structure, ex vivo and in
vitro preparations from the hippocampus have provided experimental models within 
which to study network oscillations. As such, experiments in hippocampal slices
continue to progress our understanding about both the mechanisms and functions of
cortical network oscillations. Here, advances from the past two years are
summarised, and the current state of the field discussed.

Although previous research into the mechanisms underlying sensory and episodic
representations has primarily focused on changes in neural firing rate, more
recent evidence suggests that neural oscillations also contribute to these
representations. Here, we argue that multiplexed oscillatory power and phase
contribute to neural representations at the mesoscopic scale, complementary to
neuronal firing. Reviewing recent studies which used oscillatory activity to
decipher content-specific neural representations, we identify oscillatory
mechanisms common to both sensory and episodic memory representations and
incorporate these into a model of episodic encoding and retrieval. This model
advances the idea that oscillations provide a reference frame for phase-coded
item representations during memory encoding and that shifts in oscillatory
frequency and phase coordinate ensemble activity during memory retrieval.

Sharp-wave-ripple complexes (SWRs) and interictal-spikes are physiological and
pathological forms of irregularly occurring transient high activity events in the
hippocampal EEG. They share similar features and carry high-frequency
oscillations with different spectral features. Recent results reveal similarities
and differences in the generation of the two types of transients, and argue that 
parvalbumin containing basket cells (PVBCs) are crucial in synchronizing neuronal
activity in both cases. SWRs are generated in the reciprocally connected network 
of inhibitory PVBCs, while in the pathological case, synchronous failure of
perisomatic inhibition triggers massive pyramidal cell burst firing. While
physiological ripple oscillation is primarily the result of phasic perisomatic
inhibitory currents, pathological high-frequency ripples are population spikes of
partially synchronous, massively bursting, uninhibited pyramidal cells.

Recent work involving intracranial recording during human memory performance
provides superb spatiotemporal resolution on mnemonic processes. These data
demonstrate that the cortical regions identified in neuroimaging studies of
memory fall into temporally distinct networks and the hippocampal theta activity 
reported in animal memory literature also plays a central role in human memory.
Memory is linked to activity at multiple interacting frequencies, ranging from 1 
to 500Hz. High-frequency responses and coupling between different frequencies
suggest that frontal cortex activity is critical to human memory processes, as
well as a potential key role for the thalamus in neocortical oscillations. Future
research will inform unresolved questions in the neuroscience of human memory and
guide creation of stimulation protocols to facilitate function in the damaged
brain.

This paper reviews methodologies for analyzing neural potentials via frequency,
time-frequency, or wavelet representations, and adaptive models that estimate the
signal's spatial or temporal structure. The fundamental assumptions of each
method are discussed. In particular, the Fourier transform is contrasted with
overcomplete representations, which are able to precisely delineate the timing
and/or frequency of neural events. Finally, a novel approach that combines
overcomplete representations with adaptive signal models is presented. This
approach describes a continuous signal as a linear combination of reoccurring
waveforms, referred to as phasic events, which are often associated with neural
processing. The new methodology automatically learns the reoccurring waveforms
and quantifies the neural potentials by the set of amplitudes and timings.

The problem of the transition from the molecular and cellular level to the
macroscopic level of observed assemblies of myriads of neurons is the subject
addressed in this report. The great amount of detailed information available at
molecular and cellular level seems not sufficient to account for the high
effectiveness and reliability observed in the brain macroscopic functioning. It
is suggested that the dissipative many-body model and thermodynamics might offer 
the dynamical frame underlying the rich phenomenology observed at microscopic and
macroscopic level and help in the understanding on how to fill the gap between
the bio-molecular and cellular level and the one of brain macroscopic
functioning.

This review surveys recent trends in the use of local field potentials-and their 
non-invasive counterparts-to address the principles of functional brain
architectures. In particular, we treat oscillations as the (observable) signature
of context-sensitive changes in synaptic efficacy that underlie coordinated
dynamics and message-passing in the brain. This rich source of information is now
being exploited by various procedures-like dynamic causal modelling-to test
hypotheses about neuronal circuits in health and disease. Furthermore, the roles 
played by neuromodulatory mechanisms can be addressed directly through their
effects on oscillatory phenomena. These neuromodulatory or gain control processes
are central to many theories of normal brain function (e.g. attention) and the
pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g. Parkinson's
disease).

In the past decade the emergence of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor blockers such as ketamine as fast-acting antidepressants fostered a
major conceptual advance by demonstrating the possibility of a rapid
antidepressant response. This discovery brings unique mechanistic insight into
antidepressant action, as there is a substantial amount of basic knowledge on
glutamatergic neurotransmission and how blockade of NMDA receptors may elicit
plasticity. The combination of this basic knowledge base and the growing clinical
findings will facilitate the development of novel fast acting antidepressants.

Over the last few years, genetics research has made significant strides in
identifying many risk factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These risk 
factors include inherited common single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number
variants, and rare single nucleotide variants, as well as rare de novo variants. 
For all variants, the common theme has been that of polygenicity, meaning that
many small genetic risk factors influence risk in the population and that no gene
or variant on its own has been shown to be fully deterministic of schizophrenia
or bipolar. When taken together, biological themes that have emerged including
the importance of synaptic function and calcium signaling. This has implications 
for our understanding of the biological underpinnings of these diseases.

Mutations associated with psychiatric disease are being identified, but it
remains unclear how the affected genes contribute to disease. Zebrafish is an
emerging model to study psychiatric disease genes with a rich repertoire of
phenotyping tools. Recent zebrafish research has uncovered potential
developmental phenotypes for genes associated with psychiatric disorders, while
drug screens have behaviorally characterized small molecules and identified new
classes of drugs. Behavioral studies have led to promising models for
endophenotypes of psychiatric diseases. While further research is needed to
firmly link these models to psychiatric disorders, they are valuable tools for
phenotyping genetic mutations and drugs. Recently developed tools in genome
editing and in vivo imaging promise additional insights into the processes
disrupted by mutations in psychiatric disease genes.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental
disorder with underlying brain anatomical and functional measures, as well as
familial/genetic factors that are major foci of neuropsychiatric research.
Advances in imaging technology have shown structural and functional brain
differences between individuals with and without ADHD. Longitudinal studies have 
enabled the elucidation of differences in developmental course. Studies comparing
persisting and remitting cases of ADHD are particularly promising. Therapeutic
doses of psychostimulants normalize many measures of brain anatomy and function.

Drug addiction involves long-term behavioral abnormalities and gene expression
changes throughout the mesolimbic dopamine system. Epigenetic mechanisms
establish/maintain alterations in gene expression in the brain, providing the
impetus for investigations characterizing how epigenetic processes mediate the
effects of drugs of abuse. This review focuses on evidence that epigenetic
events, specifically histone modifications, regulate gene expression changes
throughout the reward circuitry. Drugs of abuse induce changes in histone
modifications throughout the reward circuitry by altering histone-modifying
enzymes, manipulation of which reveals a role for histone modification in
addiction-related behaviors. There is a complex interplay between these enzymes, 
resulting in a histone signature of the addicted phenotype. Insights gained from 
these studies are key to identifying novel targets for diagnosis and therapy.

The onset of frank psychosis is usually preceded by a prodromal phase
characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms and a marked deterioration in
psychosocial functioning. The last two decades have seen an enormous increase in 
research work in this area, generating a series of new findings that have
significantly advanced out understanding of the neurobiology of psychosis. A key 
challenge for research in this field is to translate these findings into
improvements in the clinical management of the early phase of psychosis.

Advances in genome-wide technology, coupled with the availability of large
cohorts, are finally yielding a steady stream of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
genes carrying mutations of large effect. These findings represent important
molecular clues, but at the same time present notable challenges to traditional
strategies for moving from genes to neurobiology. A remarkable degree of genetic 
heterogeneity, the biological pleiotropy of ASD genes, and the tremendous
complexity of the human brain are prompting the development of new strategies for
translating genetic discoveries into therapeutic targets. Recent developments in 
systems biology approaches that 'contextualize' these genetic findings along
spatial, temporal, and cellular axes of human brain development are beginning to 
bridge the gap between high-throughput gene discovery and testable
pathophysiological hypotheses.

Psychosis is increasingly being understood as a neurodevelopmental
'dysconnection' syndrome, in which neural connectivity - at both microscopic and 
macroscopic levels of brain organization - becomes disrupted during late
adolescence and early adulthood. Tools to quantify normative brain development
and identify individuals at risk are urgently needed to tailor appropriate
strategies for prevention and intervention, and could substantially improve
clinical outcomes. Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
imaging (rsfc-MRI) provides a rich, functional description of the brain's
macroscopic connectivity structure. Over the past several years, rsfc-MRI has
evolved to be a powerful tool for studying both normal brain development and
abnormalities associated with psychosis. Several recent advances highlight
intriguing and potentially significant parallels between these two lines of
research. For instance, rsfc-MRI work suggests that psychosis is accompanied by
loss of segregation between large-scale brain association networks, a pattern
that is normal in early life but typically matures into more segregated systems
by young adulthood. Coupled with data sharing across large-scale neuroimaging
studies, longitudinal assessments using rsfc-MRI in patients and those at risk
will be essential for improving our biological understanding of psychosis and
will help inform diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical decision-making.

Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities, yet its brain basis and
core causes are not yet fully understood. Neuroimaging methods, including
structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging,
and electrophysiology, have significantly contributed to knowledge about the
neurobiology of dyslexia. Recent studies have discovered brain differences before
formal instruction that likely encourage or discourage learning to read
effectively, distinguished between brain differences that likely reflect the
etiology of dyslexia versus brain differences that are the consequences of
variation in reading experience, and identified distinct neural networks
associated with specific psychological factors that are associated with dyslexia.

Behavioral addictions are slowly becoming recognized as a valid category of
psychiatric disorder as shown by the recent allocation of pathological gambling
to this category in DSM-5. However, several other types of psychiatric disorder
proposed to be examples of behavioral addictions have yet to be accorded this
formal acknowledgment and are dispersed across other sections of the DSM-5. This 
brief review marks this important point in the evolution of this concept and
looks to future investigation of behavioral addictions with the theoretical
frameworks currently being used successfully to investigate substance addiction
and obsessive-compulsive disorder, in a potentially new spectrum of
impulsive-compulsive disorders.

Increasing evidence implicates abnormalities in corticostriatal circuits in the
pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and OC-spectrum disorders.
Parallels between the emergence of repetitive, compulsive behaviors and the
acquisition of automated behaviors suggest that the expression of compulsions
could in part involve loss of control of such habitual behaviors. The view that
striatal circuit dysfunction is involved in OC-spectrum disorders is strengthened
by imaging and other evidence in humans, by discovery of genes related to OCD
syndromes, and by functional studies in animal models of these disorders. We
highlight this growing concordance of work in genetics and neurobiology
suggesting that frontostriatal circuits, and their links with basal ganglia,
thalamus and brainstem, are promising candidates for therapeutic intervention in 
OCD.

Newborn neurons are continuously added to the adult hippocampus. Early studies
found that adult neurogenesis is impaired in models of depression and anxiety and
accelerated by antidepressant treatment. This led to the theory that depression
results from impaired adult neurogenesis and restoration of adult neurogenesis
leads to recovery. Follow up studies yielded a complex body of often inconsistent
results, and the veracity of this theory is uncertain. We propose five criteria
for acceptance of this theory, we review the recent evidence for each criterion, 
and we draw the following conclusions: Diverse animal models of depression and
anxiety have impaired neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is consistently boosted by
antidepressants in animal models only when animals are stressed. Ablation of
neurogenesis in animal models impairs cognitive functions relevant to depression,
but only a minority of studies find that ablation causes depression or anxiety.
Recent human neuroimaging and postmortem studies are consistent with the
neurogenic theory, but they are indirect. Finally, a novel drug developed based
on the neurogenic theory is promising in animal models.

Schizophrenia is widely regarded as a disorder of abnormal brain connectivity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that patients show robust reductions of
structural connectivity. However, corresponding changes in functional
connectivity do not always follow, with increased functional connectivity being
reported in many cases. Here, we consider different methodological and
mechanistic accounts that might reconcile these apparently contradictory findings
and argue that increased functional connectivity in schizophrenia likely
represents a pathophysiological dysregulation of brain activity arising from
abnormal neurodevelopmental wiring of structural connections linking putative hub
regions of association cortex to other brain areas. Elucidating the
pathophysiological significance of connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia
will be contingent on better understanding how network structure shapes and
constrains function.

Brain stimulation, in the form of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has long been 
a gold standard treatment for depression, but today, the field of neuromodulation
is rapidly changing with the advent of newer and more precise tools to alter
neuroplasticity and to treat brain-based disorders. Now there are new means to
induce focal seizures, as with magnetic seizure therapy (MST), or modifications
to ECT. There are also surgical approaches to target brain circuits via implanted
stimulators placed in the brain or on cranial nerves. Finally, there are
noninvasive subconvulsive approaches for the transcranial application of either
electric or magnetic fields. Collectively, these tools have transformed the face 
of neurotherapeutics and informed our understanding of the brain basis of complex
neurobehavioral conditions.

A large body of evidence describes the long term impact of stress on a number of 
biological systems and with it associated adverse health outcomes. This article
will discuss the epigenetic mechanisms of the embedding of these long term
changes, the differences in these mechanisms depending on the type and timing of 
stress exposure, including transgenerational effects as well as differences in
the mechanisms for tissue specific versus more global epigenetic changes. A
mechanistic understanding of the long term epigenetic consequences of stress may 
allow novel, targeted intervention and prevention strategies for psychiatric and 
other stress-associated disorders.

Major depression is a psychiatric disorder with high prevalence. Both specialists
in cognitive psychopathology and neurobiologists have proposed explanations of
the process/systems that exhibit altered functioning during this disorder.
Psychological processes that are dysfunctional in depressed patients include
alterations in self-referential schemas, cognitive biases, ruminations and
processing mode (over-general versus concrete). These cognitive processes are
associated with altered function of specific brain systems, including prefrontal 
areas and cingulate cortex (both involved in self-referential processes and
rumination), amygdala (cognitive bias), lateral habenula (cognitive bias) and
hippocampus (cognitive bias and overgeneral processing). This review aims to
present a coherent view integrating these two approaches in a unique model.

As a complex neuropsychiatric disease with both hereditary and environmental
components, schizophrenia must be understood across multiple biological scales,
from genes through cells and circuits to behaviors. The key to evaluating
candidate explanatory models, therefore, is to establish causal links between
disease-related phenomena observed across these scales. To this end, there has
been a resurgence of interest in the circuit-level pathophysiology of
schizophrenia, which has the potential to link molecular and cellular data from
risk factor and post-mortem studies with the behavioral phenomena that plague
patients. The demonstration that patients with schizophrenia frequently have
deficits in neuronal synchrony, including deficits in local oscillations and
long-range functional connectivity, offers a promising opportunity to forge such 
links across scales.

The brain's remarkable capacity to generate cognition and behavior is mediated by
an extraordinarily complex set of neural interactions that remain largely
mysterious. This complexity poses a significant challenge in developing
therapeutic interventions to ameliorate psychiatric disease. Accordingly, few new
classes of drugs have been made available for patients with mental illness since 
the 1950s. Optogenetics offers the ability to selectively manipulate individual
neural circuit elements that underlie disease-relevant behaviors and is currently
accelerating the pace of preclinical research into neurobiological mechanisms of 
disease. In this review, we highlight recent findings from studies that employ
optogenetic approaches to gain insight into normal and aberrant brain function
relevant to mental illness. Emerging data from these efforts offers an
exquisitely detailed picture of disease-relevant neural circuits in action, and
hints at the potential of optogenetics to open up entirely new avenues in the
treatment of psychiatric disorders.

The ongoing release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data is a watershed
event in clinical neuroscience. By attaining a quantum leap in spatial and
temporal resolution within the framework of a twin/sibling design, this open
science resource provides the basis for delineating brain-behavior relationships 
across the neuropsychiatric landscape. Here we focus on
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is at least partly
continuous across the population, highlighting constructs that have been proposed
for ADHD and which are included in the HCP phenotypic battery. We review
constructs implicated in ADHD (reward-related processing, inhibition, vigilant
attention, reaction time variability, timing and emotional lability) which can be
examined in the HCP data and in future 'high definition' clinical datasets.

The last several years have seen an increasing number of studies that describe
effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on the behavior of animals or humans. Studies
in humans have reported behavioral changes and, through fMRI, effects on brain
function. These studies are paralleled by a large number of reports, mostly in
rodents, that have also demonstrated neuromodulatory effects by oxytocin and
vasopressin at the circuit level in specific brain regions. It is the scope of
this review to give a summary of the most recent neuromodulatory findings in
rodents with the aim of providing a potential neurophysiological basis for their 
behavioral effects. At the same time, these findings may point to promising areas
for further translational research towards human applications.

How the brain takes in information, makes a decision, and acts on this decision
is strongly influenced by the ongoing and constant fluctuations of state.
Understanding the nature of these brain states and how they are controlled is
critical to making sense of how the nervous system operates, both normally and
abnormally. While broadly projecting neuromodulatory systems acting through
metabotropic pathways have long been appreciated to be critical for determining
brain state, more recent investigations have revealed a prominent role for fast
acting neurotransmitter pathways for temporally and spatially precise control of 
neural processing. Corticocortical and thalamocortical glutamatergic projections 
can rapidly and precisely control brain state by changing both the nature of
ongoing activity and by controlling the gain and precision of neural responses.

Disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe structural brain injuries
globally affect the conscious state and the expression of goal-directed
behaviors. In some subjects, neuromodulation with medications or electrical
stimulation can markedly improve the impaired conscious state present in DOC. We 
briefly review recent studies and provide an organizing framework for considering
the apparently widely disparate collection of medications and approaches that may
modulate the conscious state in subjects with DOC. We focus on neuromodulation of
the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in DOC and briefly compare mechanisms
supporting recovery from structural brain injuries to those underlying
facilitated emergence from unconsciousness produced by anesthesia. We derive some
general principles for approaching the problem of restoration of consciousness
after severe structural brain injuries, and suggest directions for future
research.

It is becoming apparent that the activity of many neural networks is shaped by
effects of endogenous neuromodulators. Modulators exert second messenger-mediated
actions that persist. We consider how this may impact network function and its
potential role in the induction of repetition priming (increased performance when
behavior is repeated). When effects of modulators persist and modulatory
substances are repeatedly released, their effects will accumulate (summate) and
become more pronounced. If this enhances the ability of a network to generate a
particular output, performance will improve. We review data that support this
model, and consider its implications for task switching. This model predicts that
priming of one type of network activity will negatively impact the rapid
transition to an incompatible type.

functional synaptic connectivity between specific neuronal populations. Most of
our knowledge comes from the photo-activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)
expressing inputs that release glutamate and GABA. More recent studies have been 
reporting releases of acetylcholine and biogenic amines but direct evidence for
photo-evoked released of neuropeptides is still limited particularly in brain
slice studies. The high fidelity in the responses with photo-evoked amino-acid
transmission is ideal for ChR2-assisted circuit mapping and this approach has
been successfully used in different fields of neuroscience. Conversely,
neuropeptides employ a slow mode of communication and might require higher
frequency and prolonged stimulations to be released. These factors may have
contributed to the apparent lack of success for optogenetic release of
neuropeptides. In addition, once released, neuropeptides often act on multiple
sites and at various distances from the site of release resulting in a greater
complexity of postsynaptic responses. Here, we focus on what optogenetics is
telling us-and failing to tell us-about fast neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.

Within the central nervous system, descending systems exist to endogenously
modulate our perception of pain. Of particular interest is a descending pathway
which projects via the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) and rostral
ventromedial medulla (RVM) to inhibit ascending nociceptive transmission at the
spinal cord dorsal horn. This descending PAG-RVM system forms the circuitry that 
underlies the physiological phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia (SIA), which
is mediated by parallel opioid and cannabinoid neurotransmitter systems in the
PAG. At the cellular level, opioids and cannabinoids are hypothesised to activate
descending analgesia through an indirect process of 'GABA
disinhibition'-suppression of inhibitory GABAergic inputs onto output neurons
which constitute the descending analgesic pathway. While there is much indirect
evidence to support disinhibition, there are still questions regarding this model
that remain unaddressed. Furthermore, there is growing evidence suggesting more
complex models than originally proposed.

The efficacy of various transmitter systems declines with advancing age. Of
particular interest, various pre-synaptic and post-synaptic components of the
dopaminergic system change across the human lifespan; impairments in these
components play important roles in cognitive deficits commonly observed in the
elderly. Here, we review evidence from recent multimodal neuroimaging,
pharmacological and genetic studies that have provided new insights for the
associations among dopamine functions, aging, functional brain activations and
behavioral performance across key cognitive functions, ranging from working
memory and episodic memory to goal-directed learning and decision making.
Specifically, we discuss these empirical findings in the context of an
established neurocomputational theory of aging neuronal gain control. We also
highlight gaps in the current understanding of dopamine neuromodulation and aging
brain functions and suggest avenues for future research.

Expectation of reward modulates many types of behaviors. Here we highlight two
lines of research on reward-modulated perceptual decision making in primates and 
social context-modulated singing in songbirds, respectively. These two seemingly 
distinct behaviors are both known to involve cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic
circuits. The underlying computations may be conceptualized using a simple,
common framework. We summarize and compare our current knowledge of the two
fields to motivate new experiments for each field, with the goal of finding
general principles for how the brain implements reward-modulated behavior.

Spinal circuits generate coordinated locomotor movements. These hardwired
circuits are supplemented with neuromodulation that provide the necessary
flexibility for animals to move smoothly through their environment. This review
will highlight some recent insights gained in understanding the functional
dynamics and plasticity of the locomotor circuits. First the mechanisms governing
the modulation of the speed of locomotion will be discussed. Second, advantages
of the modular organization of the locomotor networks with multiple circuits
engaged in a task-dependent manner will be examined. Finally, the neuromodulation
and the resulting plasticity of the locomotor circuits will be summarized with an
emphasis on endocannabinoids and nitric oxide. The intention is to extract
general principles of organization and discuss some onto-genetic and phylogenetic
divergences.

Complex regulation of dendritic transmitter release from thalamic interneurons.

United States. Electronic address: coxclee@msu.edu.

Neuronal output typically involves neurotransmitter release via axonal terminals;
however, a subpopulation of neurons can also release neurotransmitters through
vesicle-containing presynaptic dendrites. In the thalamus, local circuit
inhibitory interneurons are a class of cells that can release γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) via both axon terminals (termed F1 terminals) as well as presynaptic,
vesicle-containing dendrites (termed F2 terminals). For example, in the visual
thalamus, these F2 terminals are tightly coupled to the primary sensory afferents
(axons of retinogeniculate neurons) that synapse onto thalamocortical relay
neurons. The F2 terminals are primarily localized to distal dendrites of the
interneurons, and in certain situations the excitation/output of F2 terminals can
occur independent of somatic activity within the interneuron thereby allowing
these F2 terminals to serve as independent input/output components giving rise to
focal inhibition. On the other hand, somatically evoked Na+-dependent action
potentials can backpropagate throughout the dendritic arbor of the interneuron.
The transient depolarizations, or stronger somatically initiated events (e.g.
activation of low threshold calcium transients) can initiate a backpropagating
Ca(2+)-mediated potential that invades the dendritic arbor activating F2
terminals and leading to a global form of inhibition. These distinct types of
output (focal versus global) could play an important role in the temporal as well
as spatial roles of inhibition that in turn impacts thalamocortical information
processing.

Multiple neuromodulators regulate neuronal response properties and synaptic
connections in order to adjust circuit function. Inhibitory interneurons are a
diverse group of cells that are differentially modulated depending on neuronal
subtype and play key roles in regulating local circuit activity. Importantly, new
tools to target specific subtypes are greatly improving our understanding of
interneuron circuits and their modulation. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated
that during different behavioral states interneuron activity changes in a subtype
specific manner in both neocortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, in neocortex,
modulation of specific interneuron microcircuits results in pyramidal cell
disinhibition with important consequences for synaptic plasticity and animal
behavior. Thus, neuromodulators tune the output of different interneuron subtypes
to provide neural circuits with great flexibility.

Hypocretin (also known as orexin) is a peptide neuromodulator that is expressed
exclusively in the lateral hypothalamic area and plays a fundamental role in
wakefulness and arousal. Chronic stress and compulsive drug-seeking are two
examples of dysregulated states of hyperarousal that are influenced by hypocretin
transmission throughout hypothalamic, extended amygdala, brainstem, and
mesolimbic pathways. Here, we review current advances in the understanding of
hypocretin's modulatory actions underlying conditions of negative and positive
emotional valence, focusing particularly on mechanisms that facilitate adaptive
(and maladaptive) responses to stressful or rewarding environmental stimuli. We
conclude by discussing progress toward integrated theories for hypocretin
modulation of divergent behavioral domains.

This review highlights recent findings regarding the diverse mechanisms through
which gonadal steroid hormones modulate neuronal structure and function. In
males, estradiol aromatized from testosterone in the perinatal period permanently
masculinizes several components of mammalian brain circuitry. There is growing
appreciation, however, that these 'organizational' actions also occur outside the
perinatal period and may exist in females as well. In the mature brain,
fluctuating levels of plasma estradiol modulate the activity of many neuronal
circuits. It is clear that estradiol modulates hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons to
drive cyclical changes in their gene expression and excitability to modulate
brain control of fertility. Neuronal circuits controlling metabolism and body
weight are another network modulated by fluctuating estradiol levels, with
studies now beginning to delineate the estradiol-sensitive components of this
circuitry.

The contribution of acetylcholine to psychiatric illnesses remains an area of
active research. For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying
cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional
dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical
sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication,
increasing focused attention; however, increases in ACh signaling can lead to
symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh
release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic
elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we
review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological
control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered
cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression.

Neuromodulation can be defined as a biophysical process that serves to modify-or 
modulate-the computation performed by a neuron or network as a function of task
demands and behavioral state of the animal. These modulatory effects often
involve substances extrinsic to the network under observation, such as
acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), histamine, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine
(DA), and a variety of neuropeptides. Olfactory and gustatory processes
especially need to be adaptive and respond flexibly to changing environments,
availability of resources and physiological needs. It is therefore crucial to
understand the neuromodulatory processes that regulate the function of these
systems.

Neuromodulation confers operational flexibility on motor network output and
resulting behaviour. Furthermore, neuromodulators play crucial long-term roles in
the assembly and maturational shaping of the same networks as they develop.
Although previous studies have identified such modulator-dependent contributions 
to microcircuit ontogeny, some of the underlying mechanisms are only now being
elucidated. Deciphering the role of neuromodulatory systems in motor network
development has potentially important implications for post-lesional regenerative
strategies in adults.

A wealth of research has revealed that electrical synapses in the central nervous
system exhibit a high degree of plasticity. Several recent studies, particularly 
in the retina and inferior olive, highlight this plasticity. Three classes of
mechanisms can alter electrical coupling over time courses ranging from
milliseconds to days. Changes of membrane conductance through synaptic input or
spiking activity shunt current and decouple neurons on the millisecond time
scale. Such activity can also alter coupling symmetry, rectifying electrical
synapses. More stable rectification can be accomplished through molecular
asymmetry of the synapse itself. On the minutes time scale, changes in connexin
phosphorylation can change coupling quasi-stably with an order of magnitude
dynamic range. On the hours to days time scale, changes in expression level of
connexins alter coupling through the course of circadian time, over developmental
time, or in response to tissue injury. Combined, all of these mechanisms allow
electrical coupling to be highly dynamic, changing in response to demands at the 
whole network level, in small portions of a network, or at the level of an
individual synapse.

Neuromodulators play a key role in adjusting animal behavior based on
environmental cues and internal needs. Here, we review the regulation of
Drosophila feeding behavior to illustrate how neuromodulators achieve behavioral 
plasticity. Recent studies have made rapid progress in determining molecular and 
cellular mechanisms that translate the metabolic needs of the fly into changes in
neuroendocrine and neuromodulatory states. These neuromodulators in turn promote 
or inhibit discrete feeding behavioral subprograms. This review highlights the
links between physiological needs, neuromodulatory states, and feeding decisions.

Neuromodulation underlies the flexibility of neural circuit operation and
behavior. Individual neuromodulators can have divergent actions in a neuron by
targeting multiple physiological mechanisms. Conversely, multiple neuromodulators
may have convergent actions through overlapping targets. The divergent and
convergent neuromodulator actions can be unambiguously synergistic or
antagonistic, but neuromodulation often entails balanced adjustment of nonlinear 
membrane and synaptic properties by targeting ion channel and synaptic dynamics
rather than just excitability or synaptic strength. In addition, neuromodulators 
can exert effects at multiple timescales, from short-term adjustments of neuron
and synapse function to persistent long-term regulation. This short review
summarizes some highlights of the diverse actions of neuromodulators on ion
channel and synaptic properties.

Reconciling the deep homology of neuromodulation with the evolution of behavior.

The evolution of behavior seems inconsistent with the deep homology of
neuromodulatory signaling. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) evolved slowly
from a common ancestor through a process involving gene duplication,
neofunctionalization, and loss. Neuropeptides co-evolved with their receptors and
exhibit many conserved functions. Furthermore, brain areas are highly conserved
with suggestions of deep anatomical homology between arthropods and vertebrates. 
Yet, behavior evolved more rapidly; even members of the same genus or species can
differ in heritable behavior. The solution to the paradox involves changes in the
compartmentalization, or subfunctionalization, of neuromodulation; neurons shift 
their expression of GPCRs and the content of monoamines and neuropeptides.
Furthermore, parallel evolution of neuromodulatory signaling systems suggests a
route for repeated evolution of similar behaviors.

Co-transmission, the ability of a neuron to release multiple transmitters, has
long been recognized in selected circuits. However, the release of multiple
primary neurotransmitters from a single neuron is only beginning to be
appreciated. Here we consider recent examples of co-transmission as well as
co-release-the packaging of multiple neurotransmitters into a single vesicle. The
properties associated with each mode of release greatly enhance the possible
action of such neurons within circuits. The functional importance of dual- (or
multi-) transmitter neurons extends beyond actions on postsynaptic receptors, due
in part to differential spatial and temporal profiles of each neurotransmitter.
Recent evidence also suggests that the dual-transmitter phenotype can be
dynamically regulated during development and following injury or disease.

Caenorhabditis elegans navigates sensory landscapes by integrating inputs from 14
pairs of polymodal sensory neurons. Sensory neurons interact synaptically and
through gap junction networks and are modulated by complex local/humoral,
nutritionally dependent, monoaminergic and peptidergic signaling cascades that
dynamically reconfigure individual sensory-mediated locomotory circuits.
Monoaminergic/peptidergic signaling modifies the sensory signal by providing,
first, feedback loops between sensory neurons and postsynaptic partners to fine
tune inputs, second, crosstalk between sensory neurons to integrate responses and
third, local/humoral extrasynaptic signals to facilitate broader, long term
system-wide modulation. Overall, these observations highlight the differences
between an anatomical wiring diagram and 'functional connectomes' that are
essential to generate the alternative circuit configurations required to choose
different behavioral outcomes in the face of changing environmental inputs.

Remarkable advances have been made in recent years in our understanding of innate
behavior and the underlying neural circuits. In particular, a wealth of
neuromodulatory mechanisms have been uncovered that can alter the input-output
relationship of a hereditary neural circuit. It is now clear that this inbuilt
flexibility allows animals to modify their behavioral responses according to
environmental cues, metabolic demands and physiological states. Here, we discuss 
recent insights into how modulation of neural circuits impacts innate behavior,
with a special focus on how environmental cues and internal physiological states 
shape different aspects of feeding behavior in Drosophila.

One of the two major endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), serves as a
retrograde messenger at various types of synapses throughout the brain. Upon
postsynaptic activation, 2-AG is released immediately after de novo synthesis,
activates presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors, and transiently suppresses
neurotransmitter release. When CB1 receptor activation is combined with some
other factors such as presynaptic activity, the suppression is converted to a
long-lasting form. Whereas 2-AG primarily transmits a rapid, transient,
point-to-point retrograde signal, the other major endocannabinoid, anandamide,
may function as a relatively slow retrograde or non-retrograde signal or as an
agonist of the vanilloid receptor. The endocannabinoid system can be up- or
down-regulated by a variety of physiological and environmental factors including 
stress, which might be clinically important.

Understanding how the brain perceives, organizes and uses patterned information
is directly related to the neurobiology of language. Given the present
limitations, such knowledge at the scale of neurons, neural circuits and neural
populations can only come from non-human models, focusing on shared capacities
that are relevant to language processing. Here we review recent advances in the
behavioral and neural basis of temporal pattern processing of natural auditory
communication signals in songbirds, focusing on European starlings. We suggest a 
general inhibitory circuit for contextual modulation that can act to control
sensory representations based on patterning rules.

Song is crucial to songbirds for establishing territories and signaling genetic
quality and an important driver in speciation. Songbirds also have become a
widely used experimental model system to study the neural basis of vocal
learning, a form of imitation learning with strong parallels to human speech
learning. While there is a strong focus on central processing of song production,
we still have limited insights into the functional output of the motor neural
circuits. This review focuses on recent developments in motor control,
biomechanics and feedback mechanisms of sound production in songbirds.

In humans, brain connectivity implements a system for language and communication 
that spans from basic pre-linguistic social abilities shared with non-human
primates to syntactic and pragmatic functions particular to our species. The
arcuate fasciculus is a central connection in this architecture, linking regions 
devoted to formal aspects of language with regions involved in intentional and
social communication. Here, we outline a new anatomical model of communication
that incorporates previous neurofunctional accounts of language with recent
advances in tractography and neuropragmatics. The model consists of five levels, 
from the representation of informative actions and communicative intentions, to
lexical/semantic processing, syntactic analysis, and pragmatic integration. The
structure of the model is hierarchical in relation to developmental and
evolutionary trajectories and it may help interpreting clinico-anatomical
correlation in communication disorders.

Like speech and language, the songs of many songbirds consist of learned, rapidly
produced, structured sequences of distinct vocal units, originating from an
interplay between experience and learning biases. Songs are species specific, but
also show considerable within species variation in elements or element
sequencing. This variation implies that birds possess mechanisms to identify,
categorize and combine sounds. I review the abilities for speech sound perception
and categorization, as well as for grammatical rule learning by birds. Speech
sound perception in birds is in many ways comparable to human speech perception. 
Birds can also detect and generalize patterns underlying artificially arranged
strings of vocal elements. However, there is a need for more comparative studies 
to examine the limits of their rule learning abilities and how they relate to
those of humans.

New tools and new ideas have changed how we think about the neurobiological
foundations of speech and language processing. This perspective focuses on two
areas of progress. First, focusing on spatial organization in the human brain,
the revised functional anatomy for speech and language is discussed. The
complexity of the network organization undermines the well-regarded classical
model and suggests looking for more granular computational primitives, motivated 
both by linguistic theory and neural circuitry. Second, focusing on recent work
on temporal organization, a potential role of cortical oscillations for speech
processing is outlined. Such an implementational-level mechanism suggests one way
to deal with the computational challenge of segmenting natural speech.

One way to study language evolution is to compare human communication with
closely related non-human primate species. This comparative approach has turned
to be especially productive if subjects are studied under natural field
conditions in which they have evolved. Various observation techniques have been
developed, but field experiments are often needed to clarify underlying
cause-effect relations. Here, I review the main experimental designs that are
suitable for primate fieldwork and discuss some scientific advancements that they
have generated. Field experiments are notoriously difficult to carry out for a
range of reasons that are discussed. Nonetheless, considerable progress has been 
made in recent years, including with great apes, which have traditionally been
neglected in experimental research in the wild.

Current views on the neurobiological underpinnings of language are discussed that
deviate in a number of ways from the classical Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind
model. More areas than Broca's and Wernicke's region are involved in language.
Moreover, a division along the axis of language production and language
comprehension does not seem to be warranted. Instead, for central aspects of
language processing neural infrastructure is shared between production and
comprehension. Three different accounts of the role of Broca's area in language
are discussed. Arguments are presented in favor of a dynamic network view, in
which the functionality of a region is co-determined by the network of regions in
which it is embedded at particular moments in time. Finally, core regions of
language processing need to interact with other networks (e.g. the attentional
networks and the ToM network) to establish full functionality of language and
communication.

Recent investigations of non-human primate communication revealed vocal behaviors
far more complex than previously appreciated. Understanding the neural basis of
these communicative behaviors is important as it has the potential to reveal the 
basic underpinnings of the still more complex human speech. The latest work
revealed vocalization-sensitive regions both within and beyond the traditional
boundaries of the central auditory system. The importance and mechanisms of
multi-sensory face-voice integration in vocal communication are also increasingly
apparent. Finally, studies on the mechanisms of vocal production demonstrated
auditory-motor interactions that may allow for self-monitoring and vocal control.
We review the current work in these areas of primate communication research.

Bony fishes have evolved a diversity of sound generating mechanisms and produce a
variety of sounds. By contrast to sound generating mechanisms, which are lacking 
in several taxa, all fish species possess inner ears for sound detection. Fishes 
may also have various accessory structures such as auditory ossicles to improve
hearing. The distribution of sound generating mechanisms and accessory hearing
structures among fishes indicates that acoustic communication was not the driving
force in their evolution. It is proposed here that different constraints
influenced hearing and sound production during fish evolution, namely certain
life history traits (territoriality, mate attraction) in the case of sound
generating mechanisms, and adaptation to different soundscapes (ambient noise
conditions) in accessory hearing structures (Ecoacoustical constraints
hypothesis).

Human speech and language underlie many aspects of social behavior and thus
understanding their ultimate evolutionary function and proximate genetic and
neural mechanisms is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Mouse ultrasonic
vocalizations have recently received enormous attention as possible models for
human speech. This attention has raised the question of whether these
vocalizations are learned and what roles they play in communication. In this
review, we first discuss recent evidence that ultrasonic vocalizations are not
learned. We then review current evidence addressing how adult vocalizations may
communicate courtship, territorial and/or other information. While there is
growing evidence that these signals play key roles in communication, many
important questions remain unanswered.

Iterated learning describes the process whereby an individual learns their
behaviour by exposure to another individual's behaviour, who themselves learnt it
in the same way. It can be seen as a key mechanism of cultural evolution. We
review various methods for understanding how behaviour is shaped by the iterated 
learning process: computational agent-based simulations; mathematical modelling; 
and laboratory experiments in humans and non-human animals. We show how this
framework has been used to explain the origins of structure in language, and
argue that cultural evolution must be considered alongside biological evolution
in explanations of language origins.

In the last decade clear evidence has accumulated that elephants are capable of
vocal production learning. Examples of vocal imitation are documented in African 
(Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants, but little is known
about the function of vocal learning within the natural communication systems of 
either species. We are also just starting to identify the neural basis of
elephant vocalizations. The African elephant diencephalon and brainstem possess
specializations related to aspects of neural information processing in the motor 
system (affecting the timing and learning of trunk movements) and the auditory
and vocalization system. Comparative interdisciplinary (from behavioral to
neuroanatomical) studies are strongly warranted to increase our understanding of 
both vocal learning and vocal behavior in elephants.

The cetaceans are one of the few mammalian clades capable of vocal production
learning. Evidence for this comes from synchronous changes in song patterns of
baleen whales and experimental work on toothed whales in captivity. While baleen 
whales like many vocal learners use this skill in song displays that are involved
in sexual selection, toothed whales use learned signals in individual recognition
and the negotiation of social relationships. Experimental studies demonstrated
that dolphins can use learned signals referentially. Studies on wild dolphins
demonstrated how this skill appears to be useful in their own communication
system, making them an interesting subject for comparative communication studies.

Animals that generate acoustic signals for social communication are faced with
two essential tasks: generate a temporally precise signal and inform the auditory
system about the occurrence of one's own sonic signal. Recent studies of sound
producing fishes delineate a hindbrain network comprised of anatomically distinct
compartments coding equally distinct neurophysiological properties that allow an 
organism to meet these behavioral demands. A set of neural characters comprising 
a vocal-sonic central pattern generator (CPG) morphotype is proposed for fishes
and tetrapods that shares evolutionary developmental origins with pectoral
appendage motor systems.

Echolocating bats exhibit excellent control over their acoustic signals emitted
and skillfully interpret the returning echoes, allowing orientation and foraging 
in complete darkness. Echolocation may be a preadaptation for sophisticated vocal
communication with conspecifics and, ultimately, vocal learning processes. In
humans, the importance of auditory input for correct speech acquisition is
obvious, whereas vocal production learning is rare and patchily distributed among
non-human mammals. Bats comprise one of the few mammalian taxa capable of vocal
production learning, with current behavioral evidence for three species belonging
to two families; more evidence will probably forthcoming. The taxon's speciose
nature makes bats well suited for phylogenetically controlled, comparative
studies on proximate and ultimate mechanisms of mammalian vocal production
learning.

Humans with mutations in the transcription factor FOXP2 display a severe speech
disorder. Songbirds are a powerful model system to study FoxP2. Like humans,
songbirds communicate via vocalizations that are imitatively learned during
critical periods and this learning is influenced by social factors and relies on 
functionally lateralized neural circuits. During the past five years significant 
progress has been made moving from a descriptive to a more mechanistic
understanding of how FoxP2 functions in songbirds. Current evidence from
molecular and electrophysiological studies indicates that FoxP2 is important for 
shaping synaptic plasticity of specific neuron populations. One future goal will 
be to identify the transcriptional regulation orchestrated by FoxP2 and its
associated molecular network that brings about these physiological effects. This 
will be key to further unravel how FoxP2 influences synaptic function and thereby
contributes to auditory guided vocal motor behavior in the songbird model.

Disruptions of the FOXP2 gene cause a rare speech and language disorder, a
discovery that has opened up novel avenues for investigating the relevant neural 
pathways. FOXP2 shows remarkably high conservation of sequence and neural
expression in diverse vertebrates, suggesting that studies in other species are
useful in elucidating its functions. Here we describe how investigations of mice 
that carry disruptions of Foxp2 provide insights at multiple levels: molecules,
cells, circuits and behaviour. Work thus far has implicated the gene in key
processes including neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, sensorimotor
integration and motor-skill learning.

The pinnipeds provide a variety of clues to those interested in the vocal
learning capabilities of non-human animals. Observational and experimental
studies of seals, sea lions, and walruses reveal elements of vocal development,
contextual control, plasticity in expression and learning, and even imitation of 
complex sounds. Consideration of the factors that influence the expression of
these capabilities informs understanding of the behavioral and structural
mechanisms that support vocal learning in mammals and the evolutionary forces
shaping these capabilities.

Sexual communication can evolve in response to sexual selection, and it can also 
cause behavioral reproductive isolation between populations and thus drive
speciation. Anurans are an excellent system to investigate these links between
behavior and evolution because we have detailed knowledge of how neural
mechanisms generate behavioral preferences for calls and how these preferences
then generate selection on call variation. But we know far less about the
physical mechanisms of call production, especially how different laryngeal
morphologies generate call variation. Here we review studies of a group of
species that differ in the presence of a secondary call component that evolved
under sexual selection. We discuss how the larynx produces this call component,
and how laryngeal morphology generates sexual selection and can contribute to
speciation.

Vocal learning, in which animals modify their vocalizations to imitate those of
others, has evolved independently in scattered lineages of birds and mammals.
Comparative evidence supports two hypotheses for the selective advantages leading
to the origin of vocal learning. The sexual selection hypothesis proposes that
vocal learning evolves to allow expansion of vocal repertoires in response to
mating preferences for more complex vocalizations. The information-sharing
hypothesis also proposes that vocal learning evolves to allow expansion of vocal 
repertoires, but in this case in response to kin selection favoring sharing of
information among relatives.

Vocal learning beyond imitation: mechanisms of adaptive vocal development in

Studies of vocal learning in songbirds typically focus on the acquisition of
sensory templates for song imitation and on the consequent process of matching
song production to templates. However, functional vocal development also requires
the capacity to adaptively diverge from sensory templates, and to flexibly
assemble vocal units. Examples of adaptive divergence include the corrective
imitation of abnormal songs, and the decreased tendency to copy over-abundant
syllables. Such frequency-dependent effects might mirror tradeoffs between the
assimilation of group identity (culture) while establishing individual and
flexibly expressive songs. Intriguingly, although the requirements for vocal
plasticity vary across songbirds, and more so between birdsong and language, the 
capacity to flexibly assemble vocal sounds develops in a similar, stepwise manner
across species. Therefore, universal features of vocal learning go well beyond
the capacity to imitate.

Work on vocal communication, influenced by a drive to understand the evolution of
language, has focused on auditory processing and forebrain control of learned
vocalizations. The actual hindbrain neural mechanisms used to create
communication signals are understudied, in part because of the difficulty of
experimental studies in species that rely on respiration for vocalization. In
these experimental systems-including those that embody vocal learning-vocal
behaviors have rhythmic qualities. Recent studies using molecular markers and
'fictive' patterns produced by isolated brains are beginning to reveal how
hindbrain circuits generate vocal patterns. Insights from central pattern
generators for respiration and locomotion are illuminating common neural and
developmental mechanisms. Choice of vocal patterns is responsive to socially
salient input. Studies of the vertebrate social brain network suggest mechanisms 
used to integrate socially salient information and produce an appropriate vocal
response.

The cadherin superfamily is a large (now more than 100 proteins) protein family
originally identified as cell adhesion molecules. Each cadherin shows distinct
expression patterns in the nervous system, and their expressions are both
spatially and temporally regulated and diverse among different species. Mounting 
evidence has suggested that cadherins play multiple roles in neural development
and functions. Recently, using songbirds and mice, the potential role of
cadherins in vocal behavior has been demonstrated. Here, we will briefly
introduce general function of cadherins, and analyze the potential involvement of
cadherins in vocal behaviors and their evolution.

Remarkable examples of social cognition have been described across a diverse
range of species, yet surprisingly little is known about the neurobiological
underpinnings of these behaviors. Recent studies suggest that the molecular
pathways and neural networks that mediate social behavior have been relatively
conserved across vertebrate evolution, suggesting that shared mechanisms may
drive adaptive behavioral responses to social stimuli. Here, we review recent
advances in the neurobiology of flexible and context-dependent social behaviors
across vertebrate taxa, focusing on female mate choice, pair-bonding, and
aggressive behavior. Furthermore, we highlight the outstanding opportunities for 
uncovering the mechanisms mediating cooperative behavior, an exemplar of social
cognition. We suggest a framework for investigating context-dependent neural
organization and the evoked neural response to social stimuli.

Our ability to learn and control the motor aspects of complex laryngeal
behaviors, such as speech and song, is modulated by the laryngeal motor cortex
(LMC), which is situated in the area 4 of the primary motor cortex and
establishes both direct and indirect connections with laryngeal motoneurons. In
contrast, the LMC in monkeys is located in the area 6 of the premotor cortex,
projects only indirectly to laryngeal motoneurons and its destruction has
essentially no effect on production of species-specific calls. These differences 
in cytoarchitectonic location and connectivity may be a result of hominid
evolution that led to the LMC shift from the phylogenetically 'old' to 'new'
motor cortex in order to fulfill its paramount function, that is, voluntary motor
control of human speech and song production.

Human brain specializations supporting language can be identified by comparing
human with non-human primate brains. Comparisons with chimpanzees are critical in
this endeavor. Human brains are much larger than non-human primate brains, but
human language capabilities cannot be entirely explained by brain size. Human
brain specializations that potentially support our capacity for language include 
firstly, wider cortical minicolumns in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas compared
with great apes; secondly, leftward asymmetries in Broca's area volume and
Wernicke's area minicolumn width that are not found in great apes; and thirdly,
arcuate fasciculus projections beyond Wernicke's area to a region of expanded
association cortex in the middle and inferior temporal cortex involved in
processing word meaning.

Despite their differences, human language and the vocal communication of nonhuman
primates share many features. Both constitute a form of joint action, rely on
similar neural mechanisms, and involve discrete, combinatorial cognition. These
shared features suggest that during evolution the ancestors of modern primates
faced similar social problems and responded by evolving similar systems of
perception, communication and cognition. When language later evolved from this
common foundation, many of its distinctive features were already in place.

Dominance hierarchies are ubiquitous in social species and serve to organize
social systems. Social and sexual status is communicated directly among animals
via sensory systems evolved in the particular species. Such signals may be
chemical, visual, auditory, postural or a combination of signals. In most
species, status is initially established through physical conflict between
individuals that leads to ritualized conflict or threats, reducing possibly
dangerous results of fighting. Many of the status signals contain other
information, as in some bird species that communicate both the size of their
group and their individual rank vocally. Recent studies have shown that scent
signaling among hyenas of east Africa is unique, being produced by fermentative, 
odor producing bacteria residing in the scent glands.

Many studies in the past decade have revealed the role and mechanisms of Wnt
signaling in axon guidance during development and the reinduction of Wnt
signaling in adult central nervous system axons upon traumatic injury, which has 
profound influences on axon regeneration. With 19 Wnts and 14 known receptors (10
Frizzleds (Fzds), Ryk, Ror1/2 and PTK7), the Wnt family signaling proteins
contribute significantly to the wiring specificity of the complex brain and
spinal cord circuitry. Subsequent investigation into the signaling mechanisms
showed that conserved cell polarity pathways mediate growth cone steering. These 
cell polarity pathways may unveil general principles of growth cone guidance. The
reappeared Wnt signaling system after spinal cord injury limits the regrowth of
both descending and ascending motor and sensory axons. Therefore, the knowledge
of Wnt signaling mechanisms learned from axon development can be applied to axon 
repair in adulthood.

Wallerian degeneration (WD) occurs after an axon is cut or crushed and entails
the disintegration and clearance of the severed axon distal to the injury site.
WD was initially thought to result from the passive wasting away of the distal
axonal fragment, presumably because it lacked a nutrient supply from the cell
body. The discovery of the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) mutant mouse, in 
which distal severed axons survive intact for weeks rather than only one to two
days, radically changed our thoughts on the autonomy of axon survival. Wld(s)
taught us that under some conditions the axonal compartment can survive for weeks
after axotomy without a cell body. The phenotypic and molecular characterization 
of Wld(S) and current models for Wld(S) molecular function are reviewed
herein-the mechanism(s) by which Wld(S) spares severed axons remains unresolved. 
However, recent studies inspired by Wld(s) have led to the identification of the 
first 'axon death' signaling molecules whose endogenous activities promote axon
destruction during WD.

Neurons are one of the most polarized cell types in the body. During the past
three decades, many researchers have attempted to understand the mechanisms of
neuronal polarization using cultured neurons. Although these studies have
succeeded in discovering the various signal molecules that regulate neuronal
polarization, one major question remains unanswered: how do neurons polarize in
vivo?

During embryonic development, uncommitted pluripotent cells undergo progressive
epigenetic changes that lock them into a final differentiated state. Can
mammalian cells change identity within the living organism? Direct lineage
reprogramming of cells has attracted attention as a means to achieve organ
regeneration. However, it is unclear whether cells in the CNS are endowed with
the plasticity to reprogram. Neurons in particular are considered among the most 
immutable cell types, able to retain their class-specific traits for the lifespan
of the organism. Here we focus on two experimental paradigms, glia-to-neuron and 
neuron-to-neuron conversion, to consider how lineage reprogramming has challenged
the notion of CNS immutability, paving the way for the application of
reprogramming strategies to reshape neurons and circuits in vivo.

Single axon transection by laser surgery has made Caenorhabditis elegans a new
model for axon regeneration. Multiple conserved molecular signaling modules have 
been discovered through powerful genetic screening. In vivo imaging with single
cell and axon resolution has revealed unprecedented cellular dynamics in
regenerating axons. Information from C. elegans has greatly expanded our
knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon regeneration.

Pruning, a process by which neurons selectively remove exuberant or unnecessary
processes without causing cell death, is crucial for the establishment of mature 
neural circuits during animal development. Yet relatively little is known about
molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern neuronal pruning. Holometabolous
insects, such as Drosophila, undergo complete metamorphosis and their larval
nervous systems are replaced with adult-specific ones, thus providing attractive 
models for studying neuronal pruning. Drosophila mushroom body and dendritic
arborization neurons have been utilized as two appealing systems to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms of axon and dendrite pruning, respectively. In this review 
we highlight recent developments and discuss some similarities and differences in
the mechanisms that regulate these two distinct modes of neuronal pruning in
Drosophila.

Adult corticospinal tract axons do not regenerate because they have low intrinsic
growth ability, and are exposed to inhibitory molecules after injury. PNS axons
have a better regenerative capacity, mediated in part by integrins (extracellular
matrix receptors). These are subject to complex regulation by signalling and
trafficking. Recent studies have found that integrin mediated axon growth relies 
on signalling via focal adhesion molecules, and that integrins are inactivated by
inhibitory molecules in the CNS. Forced activation of integrins can overcome
inhibition and increase axon regeneration, however integrins are not transported 
into some CNS axons. Studies of PNS integrin traffic have identified molecules
that can be manipulated to increase axonal integrin expression, suggesting
strategies for repairing the injured spinal cord.

In contrast to mammals, fish and amphibia functionally regenerate axons in the
central nervous system (CNS). The strengths of the zebrafish model, that is,
transgenics and mutant availability, ease of gene expression analysis and
manipulation and optical transparency of larvae lend themselves to the analysis
of successful axonal regeneration. Analyses in larval and adult zebrafish suggest
a high intrinsic capacity for axon regrowth, yet signaling pathways employed in
axonal growth and pathfinding are similar to those in mammals. However, the
lesioned CNS environment in zebrafish shows remarkably little scarring or
expression of inhibitory molecules and regenerating axons use molecular cues in
the environment to successfully navigate to their targets. Future zebrafish
research, including screening techniques, will complete our picture of the
mechanisms behind successful CNS axon regeneration in this vertebrate model
organism.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a diverse family of extracellular
matrix (ECM) molecules that make significant contributions to the patterning and 
routing of migrating neural cells and extending axons. Three distinct modes of
migration mediation result from the relative abundance and positioning of
expressed CSPGs, the profile of CSPG receptors expressed by the motile cell
types, and the overall way in which the CSPGs integrate into and stabilize the
neural ECM. Here we discuss recent findings that help to clarify the molecular
mechanisms that underlie these distinct migration-regulating properties as they
pertain to neural development, CNS injury, and gliomagenesis.

Neuronal trafficking is crucial to the formation and dynamics of presynaptic and 
postsynaptic structures and the development and maintenance of axonal and
dendritic processes. The mechanism for delivering specific organelles and
synaptic molecules in axons and dendrites primarily depends on molecular motor
proteins that move along the cytoskeleton. Adaptor proteins, regulatory molecules
and local signaling pathways provide additional layers of specificity and control
over bidirectional movement, polarized transport and cargo delivery. Here we
review recent advances and emerging concepts related to the transport machinery
of crucial neuronal components, such as mitochondria and presynaptic cargoes, and
the mechanisms that modulate their polarized axo-dendritic sorting and synaptic
delivery.

Signaling pathways and cellular processes that regulate neural development are
used post-developmentally for proper function and maintenance of the nervous
system. Genes that have been studied in the context of the development of
Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) have 
been identified as players in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative
diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and
spinal muscular atrophy. Hence, by unraveling the molecular mechanisms that
underlie proneural induction, cell fate determination, axonal targeting,
dendritic branching, and synapse formation in Drosophila, novel features related 
to these disorders have been revealed. In this review, we summarize and discuss
how studies of Drosophila PNS and NMJ development have provided guidance in
experimental approaches for these diseases.

The cerebral cortex contains dozens of neuronal subtypes grouped in specific
layers and areas. Recent studies have revealed how embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells (PSC) can differentiate into a wide diversity of cortical 
neurons in vitro, while recapitulating many of the temporal and spatial features 
that characterize corticogenesis. PSC-derived neurons can integrate into the
brain following in vivo transplantation and display patterns of morphology and
connectivity specific of cortical neurons. PSC-corticogenesis thus emerges as a
robust model that provides new ways to link cortical development, evolution, and 
disease.

Our understanding of axon pathfinding mechanisms has dramatically advanced thanks
to the identification of guidance cues and receptors, and has been forged by the 
study of a limited number of model systems. Thalamocortical axons, which are
essential for sensory processing and neocortical functioning, convey sensory
information to the neocortex through a tightly controlled topographical
interconnectivity between distinct thalamic neurons and cortical areas. Recent
studies on this projection have provided mechanistic insights onto integrated
processes controlling brain wiring: axons/guidepost cells interactions, building 
of reciprocal connections and the combinatorial activity of guidance cues. This
review provides a selective overview of these novel features and stresses the
interest of thalamocortical axons as an emerging model for studying axonal
guidance and plasticity.

Different from physiological axon growth during development, a major limiting
factor for successful axon regeneration is the poor intrinsic regenerative
capacity in mature neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS).
Recent studies identified several molecular pathways, including PTEN/mTOR,
Jak/STAT, DLK/JNK, providing important probes in investigating the mechanisms by 
which the regenerative ability is regulated. This review will summarize these
recent findings and speculate their implications.

The development and repair of the nervous system requires the coordinated
expression of a large number of specific genes. Epigenetic modifications of
histones represent an essential principle by which neurons regulate
transcriptional responses and adapt to environmental cues. The post-translational
modification of histones by chromatin-modifying enzymes histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) shapes chromatin to
adjust transcriptional profiles during neuronal development. Recent observations 
also point to a critical role for histone acetylation and deacetylation in the
response of neurons to injury. While HDACs are mostly known to attenuate
transcription through their deacetylase activity and their interaction with
co-repressors, these enzymes are also found in the cytoplasm where they display
transcription-independent activities by regulating the function of diverse
proteins. Here we discuss recent studies that go beyond the traditional use of
HDAC inhibitors and have begun to dissect the roles of individual HDAC isoforms
in neuronal development and repair after injury.

Neuronal competence to re-extend axons and a permissive environment that allows
growth cone navigation are two major determinants for successful axon
regeneration. Here, we review the roles of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling in mediating both neuronal and glial injury responses after CNS injury.
BMPs can activate a pro-regenerative transcription program in neurons through
Smad-mediated canonical pathway, or act locally on cytoskeleton assembly at
distal axons via non-canonical pathways. Emerging evidence implicates retrograde 
BMP signalosomes in connecting the cytoskeletal and nuclear responses. In
addition, BMP/Smad signaling modulates neurotrophin-mediated axonal outgrowth,
and interacts with the epigenetic machinery to initiate epigenetic reprogramming 
for axon regeneration. Besides their influences on neurons, BMPs also regulate
astrogliosis, inflammatory processes, and neural progenitor cell differentiation 
at the injury site, all of which can either positively or negatively modify the
injury microenvironment. Lastly, an increasing number of BMP signaling partners, 
sensitizers, and downstream effectors collectively fine-tune the signaling
intensity and spatiotemporal dynamics of BMP activity in an integrated signaling 
network during axon regeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, affecting more 
than 25 million people worldwide. Current models of the pathophysiological
mechanisms of AD suggest that the accumulation of soluble oligomeric forms of
amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides causes early loss of excitatory synapses and impairs
synaptic plasticity. The signaling pathways mediating Aβ oligomer-induced
impairment of synaptic plasticity and loss of excitatory synapses are only
beginning to be unraveled. Here, we review recent evidence supporting the
critical contribution of conserved 'stress-response' kinase pathways in AD
progression.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) damages both gray matter and white matter, but white
matter damage is responsible for the vast majority of the subsequent functional
loss. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been investigated as a means of improving
outcomes after SCI, either through neuroprotective properties that limit
secondary damage or by direct cell replacement. This review will focus on cell
replacement strategies, and the ability of multipotent NSCs to form new
functional synaptic relays across sites of even severe SCI. The ability of these 
early stage neurons to extend axons from the lesion site in large numbers and
over long distances constitutes an important mechanism underlying their potential
to promote neural repair.

The axon initial segment (AIS) is a structurally and molecularly unique neuronal 
compartment of the proximal axon that functions as both a physiological and
physical bridge between the somatodendritic and axonal domains. The AIS has two
main functions: to initiate action potentials and to maintain neuronal polarity. 
The cytoskeletal scaffold ankyrinG is responsible for these functions and
clusters ion channels at the AIS. Recent studies reveal how the AIS forms and
remarkable diversity in its structure, function, and composition that may be
modulated by neuronal activity and posttranslational modifications of AIS
proteins. Furthermore, AIS proteins have been implicated in a variety of human
diseases. Here, we discuss these findings and what they teach us about the
dynamic AIS.

During the development and maturation of the adult nervous system, several
consecutive events, from neural induction to axon-dendrite arborization and
synapse formation, contribute to the final exquisite specificity of neuronal
networks. To accomplish this precise and healthy brain architecture, a
coordinated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in response to extracellular cues
is essential. In this review, we propose focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a key
intracellular component for this command, and summarize different studies that
support this hypothesis. We will discuss how FAK interacts with different
extracellular molecules and the cytoskeleton and how FAK functions as a sort of

Slit repulsion, mediated by Robo receptors, is known to play a major role in axon
guidance in the nervous system. However, recent studies have revealed that in the
mammalian cortex these molecules are highly versatile and that their function
extends far beyond axon guidance. They act at all phases of development to
control neurogenesis, neuronal migration, axon patterning, dendritic outgrowth
and spinogenesis. The expression of Robo receptors in cortical and
thalamocortical axons (TCAs) is tightly regulated by a combination of
transcription factors (TFs), proteases and activity. These findings also suggest 
that Slit and Robos have influenced the evolution of cortical circuits. Last,
novel genetic evidence associates various neurological disorders, such as autism,
to abnormal Slit/Robo signaling.

The development of functional neural circuits relies upon the coordination of
various cell types. In particular, astrocytes play a crucial role in
orchestrating neural development by powerfully coordinating synapse formation and
function, neuronal survival, and axon guidance. While astrocytes help to shape
neural circuits in the developing brain, the mechanisms underlying their own
development may play an equally crucial role in nervous system function. The
onset of astrogenesis is a temporally regulated phenomenon that relies upon
exogenously secreted cues and intrinsic chromatin changes. Defects in the
mechanisms underlying astrogenesis or in astrocyte function during early
development may contribute to the progression of a variety of neurodevelopmental 
disorders.

Recent advances suggest that there is a stochastic contribution to the
proliferation and fate choice of retinal progenitors. How does this stochasticity
fit with the progression of temporal competence and the transcriptional
hierarchies that also influence cell division and cell fate in the developing
retina? Where may stochasticity arise in the system and how do we make progress
in this field when we may never fully explain the behavior of individual
progenitor cells?

The long history of probing the role of neuronal activity in the development of
nervous system circuitry has recently taken an interesting turn. Although
undoubtedly activity plays a critical part in the maintenance and refinement of
synaptic connections, often via competitive mechanisms, evidence is building that
it also drives the process of synapse formation itself. Perhaps predictably, this
turns out not to be a uniform process. It seems that different circuits, indeed
specific synaptic connections, are differentially sensitive to the effects of
activity. We examine possible ways in which neurotransmitter may drive synapse
formation, and speculate on how the environment of the developing brain may allow
a different spatiotemporal range for neuronal activity to operate in the
generation of connectivity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly.
Research in the AD field has been mostly focused on the biology of the Aβ peptide
but increasing evidence is shifting attention toward the physiological role of
APP as key to understanding AD pathology. It is becoming apparent that APP plays 
a central role in the mechanisms that guarantee the accuracy and the robustness
of brain wiring. In the present review we explore APP functions with focus on
some of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

The expression of Nogo-A and the receptor NgR1 limits the recovery of adult
mammals from central nervous system injury. Multiple studies have demonstrated
efficacy from targeting this pathway for functional recovery and neural repair
after spinal cord trauma, ischemic stroke, optic nerve injury and models of
multiple sclerosis. Recent molecular studies have added S1PR2 as a receptor for
the amino terminal domain of Nogo-A, and have demonstrated shared components for 
Nogo-A and CSPG signaling as well as novel Nogo antagonists. It has been
recognized that neural repair involves plasticity, sprouting and regeneration. A 
physiologic role for Nogo-A and NgR1 has been documented in the restriction of
experience-dependent plasticity with maturity, and the stability of synaptic,
dendritic and axonal anatomy.

Radial glial cells play key roles during cerebral cortex development, as primary 
stem and progenitor cells giving rise-directly or indirectly-to neurons and glia,
but also acting as scaffold for the cerebral cortex architecture and migrating
neurons. Recent work led to the discovery of novel types of radial glial cells
with key roles in gyrification, the folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex in
phylogeny and ontogeny. Here we summarize the cellular and molecular basis of
this fascinating process allowing the expansion of the mammalian cerebral cortex 
with all its functional consequences.

There are multiple barriers to axonal growth after CNS injury. Myelin-associated 
inhibitors represent one group of barriers extrinsic to the injured neurons.
Nogo, MAG and OMgp are three prototypical myelin inhibitors that signal through
multiple neuronal receptors to exert growth inhibition. Targeting myelin
inhibition alone modulates the compensatory sprouting of uninjured axons but the 
effect on the regeneration of injured axons is limited. Meanwhile, modulating
sprouting, a naturally occurring repair mechanism, may be a more attainable
therapeutic goal for promoting functional repair after CNS injury in the near
term.

The formation of neuronal circuits is driven by complex developmental programs. A
key feature of such programs is the precise spatiotemporal control of cell
surface recognition molecules in genetically defined cells. Moreover, epigenetic 
modifications and alternative splicing processes have emerged that are not
genetically predetermined but stochastic in nature. Recent studies have
highlighted critical functions of such stochastic processes in neuronal wiring
and neuronal self-recognition. In this review, we will illustrate recently
identified principles that control the molecular diversity of neuronal cell
surface receptors, and the function of such receptors in encoding a dynamic or
stable neuronal identity.

Ephrin ligands and their Eph receptors hold our attention since their link to
axon guidance almost twenty years ago. Since then, they have been shown to be
critical for short distance cell-cell interactions in the nervous system. The
interest in their function has not abated, leading to ever-more sophisticated
studies generating as many surprising answers about their function as new
questions. We discuss recent insights into their functions in the developing
nervous system, including neuronal progenitor sorting, stochastic cell migration,
guidance of neuronal growth cones, topographic map formation, as well as synaptic
plasticity.

The developing brain employs multi-step processes to construct neural circuitry. 
Recent studies have highlighted that microglia, traditionally known to be the
resident immune cells in the brain, have essential roles in these processes,
which range from neurogenesis to establishing synaptic connections. Microglia
play bidirectional roles for maintaining proper circuitry: eliminating
unnecessary cells, axons, and synapses, while supporting the neighboring ones.
Although these processes are performed in different parts of the neuron, similar 
molecular mechanisms are possibly involved. This paper reviews recent progress on
the knowledge of the roles of microglia in brain development, and further
discusses the application of this knowledge in therapies for brain disorders and 
injuries.

Semaphorins are phylogenetically conserved proteins expressed in most organ
systems, including the nervous system. Following their description as axon
guidance cues, semaphorins have been implicated in multiple aspects of nervous
system development. Semaphorins are key regulators of neural circuit assembly,
neuronal morphogenesis, assembly of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and
synaptic refinement. Semaphorins contribute to the balance between excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic transmission, and electrical activity can modulate semaphorin
signaling in neurons. This interplay between guidance cue signaling and
electrical activity has the potential to sculpt the wiring of neural circuits and
to modulate their function.

Inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord perform dedicated roles in processing
somatosensory information and shaping motor behaviors that range from simple
protective reflexes to more complex motor tasks such as locomotion, reaching and 
grasping. Recent efforts examining inhibition in the spinal cord have been
directed toward determining how inhibitory cell types are specified and
incorporated into the sensorimotor circuitry, identifying and characterizing
molecularly defined cohorts of inhibitory neurons and interrogating the
functional contribution these cells make to sensory processing and motor
behaviors. Rapid progress is being made on all these fronts, driven in large part
by molecular genetic and optogenetic approaches that are being creatively
combined with neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral techniques.

About 20% of the total number of neurons in the brain are interneurons (INs) that
utilize GABA as their neurotransmitter. The receptors for GABA have been well
studied in principal cells, but INs also express GABA receptors, in particular
the GABAA type (GABAARs), which may also be activated in an autocrine manner by
the transmitter released by the INs themselves. As more and more neurological and
psychiatric disorders are being discovered to be linked to malfunction or
deficits of INs, this review will cover how INs communicate with each other
through the activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs. The properties of
GABAARs specific to INs may differ significantly from those found on principal
cells to open the prospect of developing IN-specific drugs.

GABAergic microcircuits structure the activation of neuronal ensembles that
support most cortical computations. Because of the heterogeneous nature of the
GABAergic cell community, a full understanding of structure-function
relationships in these microcircuits may be hampered by a reductionist approach
that consists of classifying them according to an exhaustive collection of
parameters. It therefore could be beneficial to our understanding of these
complex cells to also consider other approaches. Thus, graph theory has recently 
taught us that biological networks often include hub nodes that are essential for
information flow, and ensuing experimental evidence has demonstrated the
existence of 'operational' hub neurons. So far, only GABAergic neurons have been 
identified as 'operational hubs', further emphasizing their critical function in 
controlling cortical network dynamics.

Significant progress has been made in our understanding of how endogenous
cannabinoids (eCBs) signal at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the central
nervous system (CNS). This review discusses how eCBs regulate inhibitory
interneurons, their synapses, and the networks in which they are embedded. eCB
signaling plays a pivotal role in brain physiology by means of their synaptic
signal transduction, spatiotemporal signaling profile, routing of information
through inhibitory microcircuits, and experience-dependent plasticity.
Understanding the normal processes underlying eCB signaling is beginning to shed 
light on how their dysregulation contributes to disease.

Concepts of epilepsy, based on a simple change in neuronal excitation/inhibition 
balance, have subsided in face of recent insights into the large diversity and
context-dependence of signaling mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and
neuronal network level. GABAergic transmission exerts both seizure-suppressing
and seizure-promoting actions. These two roles are prone to short-term and
long-term alterations, evident both during epileptogenesis and during individual 
epileptiform events. The driving force of GABAergic currents is controlled by
ion-regulatory molecules such as the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 and
cytosolic carbonic anhydrases. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal ion
regulation is highly plastic, thereby contributing to the multiple roles ascribed
to GABAergic signaling during epileptogenesis and epilepsy.

The majority of cellular diversity in the hippocampus and neocortex derives from 
a relatively small population of local inhibitory interneurons. Recent
technological advances have facilitated the recording and manipulation of defined
inhibitory cell classes in awake rodents, revealing new and surprising roles for 
these cells in local circuit function and behavior. Here we review recent
progress in the analysis of inhibitory interneuron subtypes in neocortex and
hippocampus during behavior, and suggest opportunities and considerations for
extending this research program.

Schizophrenia is a disorder of cognitive neurodevelopment. At least some of the
core cognitive deficits of the illness appear to be the product of impaired gamma
frequency oscillations which depend, in part, on the inhibitory actions of a
subpopulation of cortical GABA neurons that express the calcium binding protein
parvalbumin (PV). Recent studies have revealed new facets of the development of
PV neurons in primate neocortex and of the nature of their molecular alterations 
in individuals with schizophrenia. Other recent studies in model systems provide 
insight into how these alterations may arise in the course of cortical circuitry 
development.

Convention holds that ionotropic receptors mediate fast neurotransmission and
that 'slow' G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors have a secondary, modulatory
role in the control of neuronal networks. Here, we discuss recent evidence
showing that activation of metabotropic GABAB receptors in cortical layer 1 can
powerfully inhibit principal cell activity and that their activation can rapidly 
halt ongoing network activity. Inputs from both within and without the cortex
converge upon layer 1 where they target various populations of interneurons,
including neurogliaform cells. We argue that neurogliaform cells are the main
effector of a powerful inhibitory circuit that, acting through GABAB receptors,
can be differentially recruited by long-range connections to serve in roles as
diverse as conscious perception and memory consolidation.

The cerebral cortical microcircuit is composed of pyramidal and non-pyramidal
cells and subcortical and cortico-cortical afferents. These constitute a complex 
wiring structure that remains poorly understood. At least ten non-pyramidal cell 
subtypes are known. These innervate different target neuronal domains, and have a
key role in regulating cortical neuronal activity. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex, and most cortical 
inhibitory synapses originate from non-pyramidal cells. Therefore, investigating 
the morphological and functional wiring properties of GABAergic non-pyramidal
cells is critical to understanding the functional architecture of the cortical
microcircuitry. This review focuses on current understanding of the different
roles of inhibitory GABAergic non-pyramidal cell subtypes in cortical functions.

GABAergic neurons are a minor fraction of the neocortical neuronal population,
but they are highly diverse in their features. The GABAergic neurons can be
divided into three largely non-overlapping groups, defined through the expression
of ionotropic serotonin receptors, parvalbumin or somatostatin. Membrane
potential recordings from these genetically defined GABAergic neurons in layers 2
and 3 of mouse barrel cortex reveal that they are differentially modulated by
whisker behavior. As a mouse begins to explore its environment by actively moving
its whiskers, motor-related signals drive different activity patterns in specific
types of GABAergic neurons, thereby promoting sensorimotor integration. The
neural circuit mechanisms underlying such cell-type specific activity of
GABAergic neurons are now being unraveled.

Cholinergic actions are critical for normal cortical cognitive functions. The
release of acetylcholine (ACh) in neocortex and the impact of this neuromodulator
on cortical computations exhibit remarkable spatiotemporal precision, as required
for the regulation of behavioral processes underlying attention and learning. We 
discuss how the organization of the cholinergic projections to the cortex and
their release properties might contribute to this specificity. We also review
recent studies suggesting that the modulatory influences of ACh on the properties
of cortical neurons can have the necessary temporal dynamic range, emphasizing
evidence of powerful interneuron subtype-specific effects. We discuss areas that 
require further investigation and point to technical advances in molecular and
genetic manipulations that promise to make headway in understanding the neural
bases of cholinergic modulation of cortical cognitive operations.

Among γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons, the chandelier cell (ChC) has
captured the interest of neuroscientists for a very long time as a subtype not
described by Ramon y Cajal. ChCs feature an axonal arborization that selectively 
innervates the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells. Recent studies involving
transgenic mice have identified intriguing features of ChCs, including a
remarkably specific spatial and temporal origins, their capacity to have either
excitatory or inhibitory influences on pyramidal neurons, and their synaptic
alterations in schizophrenia. This review explores these and other developmental 
and functional aspects of this fascinating cortical neuronal subtype.

Neocortical circuits are assembled from subtypes of glutamatergic excitatory and 
GABAergic inhibitory neurons with divergent anatomical and molecular signatures
and unique physiological properties. Excitatory neurons derive from progenitors
in the pallium, whereas inhibitory neurons originate from progenitors in the
subpallium. Both classes of neurons subsequently migrate along well-defined
routes to their final target area, where they integrate into common neuronal
circuits. Recent findings show that neuronal diversity within the lineages of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons is in part already established at the level of 
progenitor cells before migration. This poses challenges for our understanding of
how radial units of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons are
assembled from progenitors that are spatially segregated and diverse in nature.

Once referred to as 'short-axon' neurons by Cajal, GABA (gamma-amino butyric
acid)-ergic interneurons are essential components of the neocortex. They are
distributed throughout the cortical laminae and are responsible for shaping
circuit output through a rich array of inhibitory mechanisms. Numerous
fate-mapping and transplantation studies have examined the embryonic origins of
the diversity of interneurons that are defined along various parameters such as
morphology, neurochemical marker expression and physiological properties, and
have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. Here, we focus on discussing two recent
studies that have, for the first time, examined the production and organization
of neocortical interneurons originated from individual progenitors, that is, with
clonal resolution, and provided important new insights into the cellular
processes underlying the development of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.

The exquisite architecture of cortex incorporates a myriad of inhibitory
interneuron types. Until recently, the dearth of techniques for cell type
identification in awake animals has made it difficult to link interneuron
activity with circuit function, computation and behavior. This situation has
changed dramatically in recent years with the advent of novel tools for targeting
genetically distinct interneuron types so their activity can be observed and
manipulated. The association of different interneuron subtypes with specific
circuit functions, such as gain modulation or disinhibition, is starting to
reveal canonical circuit motifs conserved across neocortical regions. Moreover,
it appears that some interneuron types are recruited at specific behavioral
events and likely control the flow of information among and within brain areas at
behavioral time scales. Based on these results we propose that interneuron
function goes beyond network coordination and interneurons should be viewed as
integral elements of cortical computations serving behavior.

Here I review the diversity of GABAergic neurons in the rodent basolateral
amygdala (BLA). In spite of the recent identification of the role played by
certain neurons of BLA in learning and memory of fear, the diversity of GABAergic

GABAergic neurons in BLA and cerebral cortex. Emphasis is given to a
comprehensive functional, neurochemical and anatomical classification of
GABAergic neuron types.

Vertebrate locomotion relies on oscillatory activity along the spinal cord.
Inhibition is involved in controlling the alternation of activity between each
side and contributes in modulating propagation and termination of locomotor
activity. Spinal inhibitory neurons are thought to regulate these mechanisms but 
the exact contribution of specific cell types remains difficult to tackle during 
active locomotion. In the past two decades, use of the transparent zebrafish
larva has enabled morphological, functional, and genetic characterization of
specific inhibitory spinal neurons. A wide range of new optical tools has been
developed to monitor and to manipulate the activity of genetically targeted
spinal populations. Combining these techniques with conventional
electrophysiology will provide a better understanding of the contribution of
inhibitory spinal interneurons in regulating essential features of locomotor
patterns.

The function of neocortical interneurons is still unclear, and, as often happens,
one may be able to draw functional insights from considering the structure. In
this spirit we describe recent structural results and discuss their potential
functional implications. Most GABAergic interneurons innervate nearby pyramidal
neurons very densely and without any apparent specificity, as if they were
extending a 'blanket of inhibition', contacting pyramidal neurons often in an
overlapping fashion. While subtypes of interneurons specifically target
subcellular compartments of pyramidal cells, and they also target different
layers selectively, they appear to treat all neighboring pyramidal cells the same
and innervate them massively. We explore the functional implications and temporal
properties of dense, overlapping inhibition by four interneuron populations.

Identification and manipulation of different GABAergic interneuron classes in the
behaving animal are important to understand their role in circuit dynamics and
behavior. The combination of optogenetics and large-scale neuronal recordings
allows specific interneuron populations to be identified and perturbed for
circuit analysis in intact animals. A crucial aspect of this approach is coupling
electrophysiological recording with spatially and temporally precise light
delivery. Focal multisite illumination of neuronal activators and silencers in
predetermined temporal configurations or a closed loop manner opens the door to
addressing many novel questions. Recent progress demonstrates the utility and
power of this novel technique for interneuron research.

The origins of cortical interneurons in rodents have been localized to the
embryonic subcortical telencephalon where distinct neuroepithelial precursors
generate defined interneuron subsets. A swathe of research activity aimed at
identifying molecular determinants of subtype identity has uncovered a number of 
transcription factors that function at different stages of interneuron
development. Pathways that lead to the acquisition of mature interneuron traits
are therefore beginning to emerge. As genetic programs are influenced by external
factors the search continues not only into genetic determinants but also
extrinsic influences and the interplay between the two in cell fate
specification.

In the cerebral cortex GABAergic signaling plays an important role in regulating 
early developmental processes, for example, neurogenesis, migration and
differentiation. Transient cell populations, namely Cajal-Retzius in the marginal
zone and thalamic input receiving subplate neurons, are integrated as active
elements in transitory GABAergic circuits. Although immature pyramidal neurons
receive GABAergic synaptic inputs already at fetal stages, they are integrated
into functional GABAergic circuits only several days later. In consequence,
GABAergic synaptic transmission has only a minor influence on spontaneous network
activity during early corticogenesis. Concurrent with the gradual developmental
shift of GABA action from excitatory to inhibitory and the maturation of cortical
synaptic connections, GABA becomes more important in synchronizing neuronal
network activity.

Fast synaptic inhibition sculpts all forms of cortical activity by means of a
specialized connectivity pattern between highly heterogeneous inhibitory
interneurons and principal excitatory cells. Importantly, inhibitory neurons
connect also to each other extensively, following a detailed blueprint, and,
indeed, specific forms of disinhibition affect important behavioral functions.
Here we discuss a peculiar form of cortical disinhibition: the massive autaptic
self-inhibition of parvalbumin-(PV) positive basket cells. Despite being
described long ago, autaptic inhibition onto PV basket cells is rarely included
in cortical circuit diagrams, perhaps because of its still elusive function. We
propose here a potential dual role of autaptic feedback inhibition in temporally 
coordinating PV basket cells during cortical network activity.

With a fully reconstructed and extensively characterized neural circuit, the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a promising model system for integrating our
understanding of neuronal, circuit and whole-animal dynamics. Fundamental to
addressing this challenge is the need to consider the tight
neuronal-environmental coupling that allows the animal to survive and adapt to
changing conditions. Locomotion behaviors are affected by environmental variables
both at the biomechanical level and via adaptive sensory responses that drive and
modulate premotor and motor circuits. Here we review significant advances in our 
understanding of proprioceptive control of locomotion, and more abstract models
of spatial orientation and navigation. The growing evidence of the complexity of 
the underlying circuits suggests that the intuition gained is but the first step 
in elucidating the secrets of neural computation in this relatively simple
system.

The dominant computational approach to model operant learning and its underlying 
neural activity is model-free reinforcement learning (RL). However, there is
accumulating behavioral and neuronal-related evidence that human (and animal)
operant learning is far more multifaceted. Theoretical advances in RL, such as
hierarchical and model-based RL extend the explanatory power of RL to account for
some of these findings. Nevertheless, some other aspects of human behavior remain
inexplicable even in the simplest tasks. Here we review developments and
remaining challenges in relating RL models to human operant learning. In
particular, we emphasize that learning a model of the world is an essential step 
before or in parallel to learning the policy in RL and discuss alternative models
that directly learn a policy without an explicit world model in terms of
state-action pairs.

A major reason for disappointing progress of psychiatric diagnostics and nosology
is the lack of tests which enable mechanistic inference on disease processes
within individual patients. The resulting inability to pursue formal differential
diagnosis has forced the field to stick to symptom-based diagnostic schemes with 
limited predictive validity concerning treatment response and clinical outcome. A
promising new approach is the use of computational modeling for inferring
mechanisms which generate observed behavior and brain activity in psychiatric
patients. However, while this computational approach to psychiatry is rapidly
gaining attention, much work remains to be done to finesse existing computational
models, making them 'fit for practice' in a clinical setting and proving their
validity in longitudinal studies. This review outlines recent methodological
advances and strategies in this regard, focusing on generative models which infer
mechanistically interpretable parameters (of computational or physiological
processes) from measured behavior and brain activity.

The study of the mechanisms of conscious processing has become a productive area 
of cognitive neuroscience. Here we review some of the recent behavioral and
neuroscience data, with the specific goal of constraining present and future
theories of the computations underlying conscious processing. Experimental
findings imply that most of the brain's computations can be performed in a
non-conscious mode, but that conscious perception is characterized by an
amplification, global propagation and integration of brain signals. A comparison 
of these data with major theoretical proposals suggests that firstly, conscious
access must be carefully distinguished from selective attention; secondly,
conscious perception may be likened to a non-linear decision that 'ignites' a
network of distributed areas; thirdly, information which is selected for
conscious perception gains access to additional computations, including temporary
maintenance, global sharing, and flexible routing; and finally, measures of the
complexity, long-distance correlation and integration of brain signals provide
reliable indices of conscious processing, clinically relevant to patients
recovering from coma.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that record from the nervous system,
provide input directly to the nervous system, or do both. Sensory BCIs such as
cochlear implants have already had notable clinical success and motor BCIs have
shown great promise for helping patients with severe motor deficits. Clinical and
engineering outcomes aside, BCIs can also be tremendously powerful tools for
scientific inquiry into the workings of the nervous system. They allow
researchers to inject and record information at various stages of the system,
permitting investigation of the brain in vivo and facilitating the reverse
engineering of brain function. Most notably, BCIs are emerging as a novel
experimental tool for investigating the tremendous adaptive capacity of the
nervous system.

The retina performs a diverse set of complex, nonlinear, computations, beyond the
simple linear photoreceptor weighting assumed in the classical understanding of
ganglion cell receptive fields. Here we attempt to organize these computations
and extract rules that correspond to three distinct goals of early sensory
systems. First, the retina acts efficiently to transmit information to the higher
brain for further processing. We observe that although the retina adapts to a
number of complex statistics, many of these may be explained by local adaptation 
to the mean signal strength at that stage. Second, ganglion cells signal the
detection of a diverse set of features. Recent results indicate that feature
selectivity arises through the action of specific inhibition, rather than through
the convergence of excitation as in classical cortical models. Finally, the
retina conveys predictions about the stimulus, a function usually attributed only
to the higher brain. We expect that computational and mechanistic rules
associated with these classes of functions will be an important guide in the
study of other neural circuits.

Neural computation is inescapably closed-loop: the nervous system processes
sensory signals to shape motor output, and motor output consequently shapes
sensory input. Technological advances have enabled neuroscientists to close,
open, and alter feedback loops in a wide range of experimental preparations. The 
experimental capability of manipulating the topology-that is, how information can
flow between subsystems-provides new opportunities to understand the mechanisms
and computations underlying behavior. These experiments encompass a spectrum of
approaches from fully open-loop, restrained preparations to the fully closed-loop
character of free behavior. Control theory and system identification provide a
clear computational framework for relating these experimental approaches. We
describe recent progress and new directions for translating experiments at one
level in this spectrum to predictions at another level. Operating across this
spectrum can reveal new understanding of how low-level neural mechanisms relate
to high-level function during closed-loop behavior.

The ability to make accurate predictions of future stimuli and consequences of
one's actions are crucial for the survival and appropriate decision-making. These
predictions are constantly being made at different levels of the nervous system. 
This is evidenced by adaptation to stimulus parameters in sensory coding, and in 
learning of an up-to-date model of the environment at the behavioral level. This 
review will discuss recent findings that actions of neurons and animals are
selected based on detailed stimulus history in such a way as to maximize
information for achieving the task at hand. Information maximization dictates not
only how sensory coding should adapt to various statistical aspects of stimuli,
but also that reward function should adapt to match the predictive information
from past to future.

Fundamental to our perception of a unified and stable environment is the capacity
to combine information across the senses. Although this process appears seamless 
as an adult, the brain's ability to successfully perform multisensory cue
combination takes years to develop and relies on a number of complex processes
including cue integration, cue calibration, causal inference, and reference frame
transformations. Further complexities exist because multisensory cue combination 
is implemented across time by populations of noisy neurons. In this review, we
discuss recent behavioral studies exploring how the brain combines information
from different sensory systems, neurophysiological studies relating behavior to
neuronal activity, and a theory of neural sensory encoding that can account for
many of these experimental findings.

Neurons perform far more computations than the conventional framework of
summation and propagation of electrical signals from dendrite to soma to axon.
There is an enormous and largely hidden layer of molecular computation, and many 
aspects of neuronal plasticity have been modeled in chemical terms. Memorable
events impinge on a neuron as special input patterns, and the neuron has to
decide if it should 'remember' this event. This pattern-decoding decision is
mediated by kinase cascades and signaling networks over millisecond to hour-long 
timescales. The process of cellular memory itself is rooted in molecular changes 
that give rise to life-long, stable physiological changes. Modeling studies show 
how cascades of synaptic molecular switches can achieve this, despite
stochasticity and molecular turnover. Such biochemically detailed models form a
valuable conceptual framework to assimilate the complexities of chemical
signaling in neuronal computation.

Most computational neuroscientists assume that nervous systems compute and
process information. We discuss foundational issues such as what we mean by
'computation' and 'information processing' in nervous systems; whether
computation and information processing are matters of objective fact or of
conventional, observer-dependent description; and how computational descriptions 
and explanations are related to other levels of analysis and organization.

Working memory is a system that maintains and manipulates information for several
seconds during the planning and execution of many cognitive tasks. Traditionally,
it was believed that the neuronal underpinning of working memory is stationary
persistent firing of selective neuronal populations. Recent advances introduced
new ideas regarding possible mechanisms of working memory, such as short-term
synaptic facilitation, precise tuning of recurrent excitation and inhibition, and
intrinsic network dynamics. These ideas are motivated by computational
considerations and careful analysis of experimental data. Taken together, they
may indicate the plethora of different processes underlying working memory in the
brain.

At present there is no generally accepted theory of how cognitive phenomena arise
from computations in cortex. Further, there is no consensus on how the search for
one should be refocussed so as to make it more fruitful. In this short piece we
observe that research in computer science over the last several decades has shown
that significant computational phenomena need to circumvent significant inherent 
quantitative impediments, such as of computational complexity. We argue that
computational neuroscience has to be informed by the same quantitative concerns
for it to succeed. It is conceivable that the brain is the one computation that
does not need to circumvent any such obstacles, but if that were the case then
quantitatively plausible theories of cortex would now surely abound and be
driving experimental investigations.

Brain injury profoundly affects global brain dynamics, and these changes are
manifest in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Despite the heterogeneity of injury
mechanisms and the modularity of brain function, there is a commonality of
dynamical features that characterize the EEG along the gamut from coma to
recovery. After severest injury, EEG activity is concentrated below 1 Hz. In
minimally conscious state during wakefulness, there is a peak of activity in the 
3-7 Hz range, often coherent across the brain, and often also activity in the
beta (15-30 Hz) range. These spectral changes likely result from varying degrees 
of functional deafferentation at thalamic and cortical levels. EEG-based indices 
of brain dynamics that go beyond these simple spectral measures may provide
further diagnostic information and physiologic insights.

We provide an overview and comparison of several recent large-scale brain models.
In addition to discussing challenges involved with building large neural models, 
we identify several expected benefits of pursuing such a research program. We
argue that these benefits are only likely to be realized if two basic guidelines 
are made central to the pursuit. The first is that such models need to be
intimately tied to behavior. The second is that models, and more importantly
their underlying methods, should provide mechanisms for varying the level of
simulated detail. Consequently, we express concerns with models that insist on a 
'correct' amount of detail while expecting interesting behavior to simply emerge.

Cortical neurons operate within recurrent neuronal circuits. Dissecting their
operation is key to understanding information processing in the cortex and
requires transparent and adequate dynamical models of circuit function.
Convergent evidence from experimental and theoretical studies indicates that
strong feedback inhibition shapes the operating regime of cortical circuits. For 
circuits operating in inhibition-dominated regimes, mathematical and
computational studies over the past several years achieved substantial advances
in understanding response modulation and heterogeneity, emergent stimulus
selectivity, inter-neuron correlations, and microstate dynamics. The latter
indicate a surprisingly strong dependence of the collective circuit dynamics on
the features of single neuron action potential generation. New approaches are
needed to definitely characterize the cortical operating regime.

Perceptual and control systems are tasked with the challenge of accurately and
efficiently estimating the dynamic states of objects in the environment. To
properly account for uncertainty, it is necessary to maintain a dynamical belief 
state representation rather than a single state vector. In this review, canonical
algorithms for computing and updating belief states in robotic applications are
delineated, and connections to biological systems are highlighted. A navigation
example is used to illustrate the importance of properly accounting for
correlations between belief state components, and to motivate the need for
further investigations in psychophysics and neurobiology.

Neural activity and behavior in laboratory experiments are surprisingly variable 
across trials. This variability and its potential causes have been the focus of a
spirited debate. Here we review recent research that has shed light on the
sources of neural variability and its impact on behavior. We explain how
variability may arise from incomplete knowledge about an animal's internal states
and its environment. We discuss the problem of incomplete knowledge both from the
experimenter's point of view and from the animal's point of view. Both view
points are illustrated through several examples from the literature. We
furthermore consider both mechanistic and normative models that explain how
neural and behavioral variability may be linked. Finally, we review why
variability may confer an adaptive advantage to organisms.

Advances in experimental techniques, including behavioral paradigms using rich
stimuli under closed loop conditions and the interfacing of neural systems with
external inputs and outputs, reveal complex dynamics in the neural code and
require a revisiting of standard concepts of representation. High-throughput
recording and imaging methods along with the ability to observe and control
neuronal subpopulations allow increasingly detailed access to the neural
circuitry that subserves neural representations and the computations they
support. How do we harness theory to build biologically grounded models of
complex neural function?

Computational neuroscience has focused largely on the dynamics and function of
local circuits of neuronal populations dedicated to a common task, such as
processing a common sensory input, storing its features in working memory,
choosing between a set of options dictated by controlled experimental settings or
generating the appropriate actions. Most of current circuit models suggest
mechanisms for computations that can be captured by networks of simplified
neurons connected via simple synaptic weights. In this article I review the
progress of this approach and its limitations. It is argued that new experimental
techniques will yield data that might challenge the present paradigms in that
they will (1) demonstrate the computational importance of microscopic structural 
and physiological complexity and specificity; (2) highlight the importance of
models of large brain structures engaged in a variety of tasks; and (3) reveal
the necessity of coupling the neuronal networks to chemical and environmental
variables.

Recent results have shown the possibility of both reconstructing connectomes of
small but biologically interesting circuits and extracting from these connectomes
insights into their function. However, these reconstructions were heroic
proof-of-concept experiments, requiring person-months of effort per neuron
reconstructed, and will not scale to larger circuits, much less the brains of
entire animals. In this paper we examine what will be required to generate and
use substantially larger connectomes, finding five areas that need increased
attention: firstly, imaging better suited to automatic reconstruction, with
excellent z-resolution; secondly, automatic detection, validation, and
measurement of synapses; thirdly, reconstruction methods that keep and use
uncertainty metrics for every object, from initial images, through segmentation, 
reconstruction, and connectome queries; fourthly, processes that are fully
incremental, so that the connectome may be used before it is fully complete; and 
finally, better tools for analysis of connectomes, once they are obtained.

Reinforcement learning requires the convergence of signals representing context, 
action, and reward. While models of basal ganglia function have well-founded
hypotheses about the neural origin of signals representing context and reward,
the function and origin of signals representing action are less clear. Recent
findings suggest that exploratory or variable behaviors are initiated by a wide
array of 'action-generating' circuits in the midbrain, brainstem, and cortex.
Thus, in order to learn, the striatum must incorporate an efference copy of
action decisions made in these action-generating circuits. Here we review several
recent neural models of reinforcement learning that emphasize the role of
efference copy signals. Also described are ideas about how these signals might be
integrated with inputs signaling context and reward.

Recent experiments support the theoretical hypothesis that recurrent connectivity
plays a central role within the medial entorhinal cortex, by shaping activity of 
large neural populations, such that their joint activity lies within a continuous
attractor. This conjecture involves dynamics within each population (module) of
cells that share the same grid spacing. In addition, recent theoretical works
raise a hypothesis that, taken together, grid cells from all modules maintain a
sophisticated representation of position with uniquely large dynamical range,
when compared with other known neural codes in the brain. To maintain such a
code, activity in different modules must be coupled, within the entorhinal cortex
or through the hippocampus.

'High-level' vision lacks a single, agreed upon definition, but it might usefully
be defined as those stages of visual processing that transition from analyzing
local image structure to analyzing structure of the external world that produced 
those images. Much work in the last several decades has focused on object
recognition as a framing problem for the study of high-level visual cortex, and
much progress has been made in this direction. This approach presumes that the
operational goal of the visual system is to read-out the identity of an object
(or objects) in a scene, in spite of variation in the position, size, lighting
and the presence of other nearby objects. However, while object recognition as a 
operational framing of high-level is intuitive appealing, it is by no means the
only task that visual cortex might do, and the study of object recognition is
beset by challenges in building stimulus sets that adequately sample the infinite
space of possible stimuli. Here I review the successes and limitations of this
work, and ask whether we should reframe our approaches to understanding
high-level vision.

Comparison of the functional organization of sensory modalities can reveal the
specialized mechanisms unique to each modality as well as processing algorithms
that are common across modalities. Here we examine the rodent whisker system. The
whisker's mechanical properties shape the forces transmitted to specialized
receptors. The sensory and motor systems are intimately interconnected, giving
rise to two forms of sensation: generative and receptive. The sensory pathway is 
a test bed for fundamental concepts in computation and coding: hierarchical
feature detection, sparseness, adaptive representations, and population coding.
The central processing of signals can be considered a sequence of filters. At the
level of cortex, neurons represent object features by a coordinated population
code which encompasses cells with heterogeneous properties.

The auditory system analyses acoustic signals, extracting their perceptual
attributes, and exploiting them to navigate complex auditory environments. While 
many of the basic transformations that give rise to the early auditory
representations are well studied and understood, little is known about the latter
cognitive functions that bind, organize, and give meaning to them. They include
the ability to attend to, segregate, and track one of many sound sources, to
learn its identity, commit it to memory, robustly recognize it, and utilize it to
make decisions. This review hints at the profound adaptive influences and
contextual effects induced by cognitive functions during these behaviors, and the
need for robust tractable mathematical models to understand them.

Many recent studies of neurons recorded from cortex reveal complex temporal
dynamics. How such dynamics embody the computations that ultimately lead to
behavior remains a mystery. Approaching this issue requires developing plausible 
hypotheses couched in terms of neural dynamics. A tool ideally suited to aid in
this question is the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs straddle the fields of 
nonlinear dynamical systems and machine learning and have recently seen great
advances in both theory and application. I summarize recent theoretical and
technological advances and highlight an example of how RNNs helped to explain
perplexing high-dimensional neurophysiological data in the prefrontal cortex.

At the single neuron level, information processing involves the transformation of
input spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Building upon the
classical view of a neuron as a threshold device, models have been developed in
recent years that take into account the diverse electrophysiological make-up of
neurons and accurately describe their input-output relations. Here, we review
these recent advances and survey the computational roles that they have uncovered
for various electrophysiological properties, for dendritic arbor anatomy as well 
as for short-term synaptic plasticity.

Population coding theory aims to provide quantitative tests for hypotheses
concerning the neural code. Over the last two decades theory has focused on
analyzing the ways in which various parameters that characterize neuronal
responses to external stimuli affect the information content of these responses. 
This article reviews and provides an intuitive explanation for the major effects 
of noise correlations and neuronal heterogeneity, and discusses their
implications for our ability to investigate the neural code. It is argued that to
test neural code hypotheses further, additional constraints are required,
including relating trial-to-trial variation in neuronal population responses to
behavioral decisions and specifying how information is decoded by downstream
networks.

Recent experimental reports have suggested that cortical networks can operate in 
regimes were sensory information is encoded by relatively small populations of
spikes and their precise relative timing. Combined with the discovery of spike
timing dependent plasticity, these findings have sparked growing interest in the 
capabilities of neurons to encode and decode spike timing based neural
representations. To address these questions, a novel family of methodologically
diverse supervised learning algorithms for spiking neuron models has been
developed. These models have demonstrated the high capacity of simple neural
architectures to operate also beyond the regime of the well established
independent rate codes and to utilize theoretical advantages of spike timing as
an additional coding dimension.

Analyzing data from experiments involves variables that we neuroscientists are
uncertain about. Efficiently calculating with such variables usually requires
Bayesian statistics. As it is crucial when analyzing complex data, it seems
natural that the brain would "use" such statistics to analyze data from the
world. And indeed, recent studies in the areas of perception, action, and
cognition suggest that Bayesian behavior is widespread, in many modalities and
species. Consequently, many models have suggested that the brain is built on
simple Bayesian principles. While the brain's code is probably not actually
simple, I believe that Bayesian principles will facilitate the construction of
faithful models of the brain.

A fundamental challenge for computational and cognitive neuroscience is to
understand how reward-based learning and decision-making are made and how accrued
knowledge and internal models of the environment are incorporated. Remarkable
progress has been made in the field, guided by the midbrain dopamine reward
prediction error hypothesis and the underlying reinforcement learning framework, 
which does not involve internal models ('model-free'). Recent studies, however,
have begun not only to address more complex decision-making processes that are
integrated with model-free decision-making, but also to include internal models
about environmental reward structures and the minds of other agents, including
model-based reinforcement learning and using generalized prediction errors. Even 
dopamine, a classic model-free signal, may work as multiplexed signals using
model-based information and contribute to representational learning of reward
structure.

General anesthesia is a neurophysiological state that consists of
unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility along with maintenance of
physiological stability. General anesthesia has been used in the United States
for more than 167 years. Now, using systems neuroscience paradigms how
anesthetics act in the brain and central nervous system to create the states of
general anesthesia is being understood. Propofol is one of the most widely used
and the most widely studied anesthetics. When administered for general anesthesia
or sedation, the electroencephalogram (EEG) under propofol shows highly
structured, rhythmic activity that is strongly associated with changes in the
patient's level of arousal. These highly structured oscillations lend themselves 
readily to mathematical descriptions using dynamical systems models. We review
recent model descriptions of the commonly observed EEG patterns associated with
propofol: paradoxical excitation, strong frontal alpha oscillations,
anteriorization and burst suppression. Our analysis suggests that propofol's
actions at GABAergic networks in the cortex, thalamus and brainstem induce
profound brain dynamics that are one of the likely mechanisms through which this 
anesthetic induces altered arousal states from sedation to unconsciousness.
Because these dynamical effects are readily observed in the EEG, the mathematical
descriptions of how propofol's EEG signatures relate to its mechanisms of action 
in neural circuits provide anesthesiologists with a neurophysiologically based
approach to monitoring the brain states of patients receiving anesthesia care.

Mammals have ∼1000 different olfactory receptor subtypes, each responding to a
number of different odorants, and each odorant activating a number of different
receptor subtypes. These molecular and anatomical underpinnings of olfaction
imply a perceptual structure of very high dimensionality that relies on
combinatorial coding. In contrast to this expectation, the study of olfactory
perception reveals a structure of much lower dimensionality. Moreover, a
low-dimensionality approach to olfaction enabled derivation of perception-based
structural metrics for smell. These metrics provided meaningful predictions of
odorant-induced neural activity and perception from odorant structure alone.
Based on this low functional dimensionality, we speculate that olfaction likely
does not functionally rely on 1000 different receptor subtypes, and their
persistence in evolution may imply that they have additional roles in
non-olfactory functions such as in guidance of embryogenesis and development.

The initial structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles,
birds, and mammals happens independent of sensory experience. After eye opening, 
visual experience further refines and elaborates circuits that are critical for
normal visual function. Innate genetic programs that code for gradients of
molecules provide gross positional information for developing nerve cells, yet
much of the cytoarchitectural complexity and synaptogenesis of neurons depends on
calcium influx, neurotransmitter release, and neural activity before the onset of
vision. In fact, specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, or 'retinal
waves', emerge amidst the development of the earliest connections made between
excitable cells in the developing eye. These patterns of spontaneous activity,
which have been observed in all amniote retinae examined to date, may be an
evolved adaptation for species with long gestational periods before the onset of 
functional vision, imparting an informational robustness and redundancy to guide 
development of visual maps across the nervous system. Recent experiments indicate
that retinal waves play a crucial role in the development of interconnections
between different parts of the visual system, suggesting that these spontaneous
patterns serve as a template-matching mechanism to prepare higher-order visually 
associative circuits for the onset of visuomotor learning and behavior. Key
questions for future studies include determining the exact sources and nature of 
spontaneous activity during development, characterizing the interactions between 
neural activity and transcriptional gene regulation, and understanding the extent
of circuit connectivity governed by retinal waves within and between
sensory-motor systems.

The neocortex is a defining feature of the mammalian brain and its expansion is
one of the hallmarks of human evolution. Given the complexity of human behavior, 
it is tempting to think that as a species humans are exclusive compared to other 
animals. However, comparative studies indicate that human brains follow the same 
rules of construction and that alterations to the human neocortex take a similar 
form as in other mammals. Studies from a number of disciplines indicate that many
of the morphological specializations associated with the vocal tract, ear and
hand were present in early hominins and thus our ancestors had the capacity for
speech, language and sophisticated manual abilities, yet much of modern human
behavior evolved very recently. In this review, we discuss the possibility that
phenotypic changes in modern human brains and behavior may have been mediated by 
epigenetic mechanisms that allowed for context dependent changes to the cortical 
phenotype. Further, we consider whether these epigenetic mechanisms may be more
readily engaged in humans than in other species in order to rapidly meet the
demands of a dynamic environment. We suggest that perhaps it is the extent to
which the neocortex incorporates these context dependent alterations that
distinguishes humans from other mammals.

Auditory cortical maps have been a long-standing focus of studies that assess the
expression, mechanisms, and consequences of sensory plasticity. Here we discuss
recent progress in understanding how auditory experience transforms spatially
organized sound representations at higher levels of the central auditory
pathways. New insights into the mechanisms underlying map changes have been
achieved and more refined interpretations of various map plasticity effects and
their consequences in terms of behavioral corollaries and learning as well as
other cognitive aspects have been offered. The systematic organizational
principles of cortical sound processing remain a key aspect in studying and
interpreting the role of plasticity in hearing.

Everything the brain knows about the content of the visual world is built from
the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). As the output neurons of
the eye, RGCs include ∼20 different subtypes, each responding best to a specific 
feature in the visual scene. Here we discuss recent advances in identifying where
different RGC subtypes route visual information in the brain, including which
targets they connect to and how their organization within those targets
influences visual processing. We also highlight examples where causal links have 
been established between specific RGC subtypes, their maps of central connections
and defined aspects of light-mediated behavior and we suggest the use of
techniques that stand to extend these sorts of analyses to circuits underlying
visual perception.

Sensory information in the visual, auditory and somatosensory systems is
organized topographically, with key sensory features ordered in space across
neural sheets. Despite the existence of a spatially stereotyped map of odor
identity within the olfactory bulb, it is unclear whether the higher olfactory
cortex uses topography to organize information about smells. Here, we review
recent work on the anatomy, microcircuitry and neuromodulation of two
higher-order olfactory areas: the piriform cortex and the olfactory tubercle. The
piriform is an archicortical region with an extensive local associational network
that constructs representations of odor identity. The olfactory tubercle is an
extension of the ventral striatum that may use reward-based learning rules to
encode odor valence. We argue that in contrast to brain circuits for other
sensory modalities, both the piriform and the olfactory tubercle largely discard 
any topography present in the bulb and instead use distributive afferent
connectivity, local learning rules and input from neuromodulatory centers to
build behaviorally relevant representations of olfactory stimuli.

The hippocampal formation (HF) contains a neural representation of the
environment, based on the activity of several classes of neurons whose firing is 
tuned to an animal's position and orientation in space. Recently, work has begun 
on understanding when and how this neural map of space emerges during
development. Different classes of spatially tuned neurons emerge at different
ages, some of them very early during development, before animals have started
exploring their environment. The developmental timeline thus far uncovered has
yielded insights into both the mechanisms of the ontogeny of the neural code for 
space, as well as how this system functions in the adult.

The auditory system drives behavior using information extracted from sounds.
Early in the auditory hierarchy, circuits are highly specialized for detecting
basic sound features. However, already at the level of the auditory cortex the
functional organization of the circuits and the underlying coding principles
become different. Here, we review some recent progress in our understanding of
single neuron and population coding in primary auditory cortex, focusing on
natural sounds. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining why single neuron
responses to simple sounds cannot predict responses to natural stimuli. We
describe recent work suggesting that structural features like local subnetworks
rather than smoothly mapped tonotopy are essential components of population
coding. Finally, we suggest a synthesis of how single neurons and subnetworks may
be involved in coding natural sounds.

Theoretical neuroscientists have long been intrigued by the spatial patterns of
neuronal selectivities observed in the visual cortices of many mammals, including
primates. While theoretical studies have contributed significantly to our
understanding of how the brain learns to see, recent experimental discoveries of 
the spatial irregularity of visual response properties in the rodent visual
cortex have prompted new questions about the origin and functional significance
of cortical maps. Characterizing the marked differences of cortical design
principles among species and comparing them may provide us with a deeper
understanding of primate and non-primate vision.

The brain's cortical maps serve as a macroscopic framework upon which additional 
levels of detail can be overlaid. Unlike sensory maps generated by measuring the 
brain's responses to incoming stimuli, motor maps are made by directly
stimulating the brain itself. To understand the significance of motor maps and
the functions they represent, it is necessary to consider the relationship
between the natural operation of the motor system and the pattern of activity
evoked in it by artificial stimulation. We review recent findings from the study 
of the cortical motor system and new insights into the control of movement based 
on its mapping within cortical space.

The convergent evolution of hearing in insects and vertebrates raises the
question about similarity of the central representation of sound in these distant
animal groups. Topographic representations of spectral, spatial and temporal cues
have been widely described in mammals, but evidence for such maps is scarce in
insects. Recent data on insect sound encoding provides evidence for an early
integration of sound parameters to form highly-specific representation that
predict behavioral output. In mammals, new studies investigating neural
representation of perceptual features in behaving animals allow asking similar
questions. A comparative approach may help in understanding principles underlying
the formation of perceptual categories and behavioral plasticity.

Functional reorganization of the whisker map in rodent barrel cortex has long
served as a model for cortical plasticity following changes in sensory
experience. Given the heterogeneity of neuronal response properties in neocortex,
it has remained unclear how individual neurons in the cortical microcircuit are
affected. Novel in vivo imaging and electrophysiology methods allow longitudinal 
recording of the same neurons' functional properties and therefore have the
critical ability to resolve the direction and dynamics of change as plasticity
progresses. Tracking sensory responsiveness before and after whisker trimming has
uncovered diverse effects in individual neurons, suggesting that longitudinal
recording will be essential for elucidating plasticity mechanisms within cortical
microcircuits.

Computational brain maps as opposed to maps of receptor surfaces strongly reflect
functional neuronal design principles. In echolocating bats, computational maps
are established that topographically represent the distance of objects. These
target range maps are derived from the temporal delay between emitted call and
returning echo and constitute a regular representation of time (chronotopy).
Basic features of these maps are innate, and in different bat species the map
size and precision varies. An inherent advantage of target range maps is the
implementation of mechanisms for lateral inhibition and excitatory feedback. Both
can help to focus target ranging depending on the actual echolocation situation. 
However, these maps are not absolutely necessary for bat echolocation since there
are bat species without cortical target-distance maps, which use alternative
ensemble computation mechanisms.

The study of spatial maps of the ventral sensory-motor cortex (vSMC) dates back
to the earliest cortical stimulation studies. This review surveys a number of
recent and historical reports of the features and function of spatial maps within
vSMC towards the human behavior of speaking. Representations of the vocal tract, 
like other body parts, are arranged in a somatotopic fashion within ventral SMC. 
This region has unique features and connectivity that may give insight into its
specialized function in speech production. New methods allow us to probe further 
into the functional role of this organization by studying the spatial dynamics of
vSMC during natural speaking in humans.

A map of sound direction was found in the owl's midbrain more than three decades 
ago. This finding suggested that the brain reconstructs spatial coordinates to
represent them. Subsequent research elucidated the variables used to compute the 
map. Here we provide a review of the processes leading to its emergence and an
updated perspective on how and what information is represented.

Spatial discharge patterns in medial entorhinal cortex consist of grid, head
direction, border and spatial-band cells. These firing patterns differ from the
single-peaked fields of hippocampal place cells, in that they have well-defined
geometries and extend throughout the available space. Such discharge properties
could contribute to a metric representation of space. Both functional and
anatomical evidence point to principal cell diversity, modularity and columnar
organization, but linking entorhinal anatomy and physiology remains challenging. 
Layer 2 microcircuits consist of pyramidal neurons and a stellate cell network,
which lacks recurrent excitation and is coupled by disynaptic inhibition.
Intracellular recordings showed that periodic, grid-like firing emerges from
depolarization ramps, whereas theta-oscillations determine spike timing.
Interference with various inputs to entorhinal cortex abolishes grid activity,
often without concomitant loss of hippocampal place activity.

Parietal cortex has long been known to be a site of sensorimotor integration.
Recent findings in humans have shown that it is divided up into a number of small
areas somewhat specialized for eye movements, reaching, and hand movements, but
also face-related movements (avoidance, eating), lower body movements, and
movements coordinating multiple body parts. The majority of these areas contain
rough sensory (receptotopic) maps, including a substantial multisensory
representation of the lower body and lower visual field immediately medial to
face VIP. There is strong evidence for retinotopic remapping in LIP and
face-centered remapping in VIP, and weaker evidence for hand-centered remapping. 
The larger size of the functionally distinct inferior parietal default mode
network in humans compared to monkeys results in a superior and medial
displacement of middle parietal areas (e.g., the saccade-related LIP's).
Multisensory superior parietal areas located anterior to the angular gyrus such
as AIP and VIP are less medially displaced relative to macaque monkeys, so that
human LIP paradoxically ends up medial to human VIP.

Why are some odors perceived as pleasant while others are not? We review current 
research on how pleasant and unpleasant odors, that is, odors with positive or
negative valence, are processed in the brain of flies and mice. We conclude that 
in mice pleasant and unpleasant odors are detected via three olfactory subsystems
with only one being fully dedicated to unpleasant odors, while the others detect 
both good and bad odors. Correspondingly, so far no clear segmentation into
regions processing exclusively pleasant or unpleasant odors has been identified
in the mouse brain. The situation is different in flies, where most odors are
sensed via the antenna. Already at the antennal lobe level, that is, the first
processing center for olfactory input, odorants seem to be categorized as
pleasant or unpleasant. We furthermore discuss why animals at all should make a
decision based on olfaction, and why a straightforward and fast processing of
odorant valence might be important for survival and reproduction.

During sensory experience, the retina transmits a diverse array of signals to the
brain, which must be parsed to generate meaningful percepts that can guide
decisions and actions. Decades of anatomical and physiological studies in
primates and carnivores have revealed a complex parallel and hierarchical
organization by which distinct visual features are distributed to, and processed 
by, different brain regions. However, these studies have been limited in their
ability to dissect the circuit mechanisms involved in the transformation of
sensory inputs into complex cortical representations and action patterns.
Multiple groups have therefore pushed to explore the organization and function of
higher visual areas in the mouse. Here we review the anatomical and physiological
findings of these recent explorations in mouse visual cortex. These studies find 
that sensory input is processed in a diverse set of higher areas that are each
interconnected with specific limbic and motor systems. This hierarchical and
parallel organization is consistent with the multiple streams that have been
found in the higher visual areas of primates. We therefore propose that the mouse
visual system is a useful model to explore the circuits underlying the
transformation of sensory inputs into goal-directed perceptions and actions.

Many sensory features are topographically mapped in the mammalian cortex. In each
case, features of the external world are systematically represented across the
cortical area in a topographic manner, providing a complete representation of
stimulus space. The cortex in turn utilizes sets of functionally specific,
connected neurons to extract behaviorally relevant features from the incoming
sensory information. This organization is perhaps best exemplified by the
classical cortical column. The degree to which such networks also exist in
high-end association cortices has been unclear. Recently it was shown that the
grid map of the entorhinal cortex is organized in a modular fashion. Here, we
review the key features of the grid modules and the extent to which the grid
modules resemble functional arrangements in other areas of cortex.

The active electrosense of weakly electric fish is evolutionarily and
developmentally related to passive electrosensation and the lateral line system. 
It shows the most highly differentiated topographic maps of the receptor array of
all these senses. It is organized into three maps in the hindbrain that are, in
turn, composed of columns, each consisting of six pyramidal cell classes. The
cells in each column have different spatiotemporal processing properties yielding
a total of 18 topographic representations of the body surface. The differential
filtering by the hindbrain maps is used by superimposed maps in the multi-layered
midbrain electrosensory region to extract specific stimulus features related to
communication and foraging. At levels beyond the midbrain, topographic mapping of
the body surface appears to be lost.

Topographic maps are utilized in many sensory and motor systems to efficiently
transfer information between brain regions. The retina's projection to the
superior colliculus has served as a model for the identification of molecular
cues and mechanistic strategies by which topographic maps are formed. Evidence
from both in vitro and in vivo studies points to graded cell surface cues playing
a central role, but support for axon-axon competition and selective degeneration 
have also been advanced recently. In combination with mathematical models, these 
studies suggest that topographic maps are established using a complex combination
of strategies to ensure precise connectivity.

Neurons in the visual system respond to more complex and holistic features at
each new stage of processing. Often, these features are organized into continuous
maps. Could there be a fundamental link between continuous maps and functional
hierarchies? Here, we review recent studies regarding V1 maps providing some of
the most noteworthy advances in our understanding of how and why maps exist. In
particular, we focus on the common theme that some maps are inherited from the
input of parallel pathways, which are then intimately linked to the emergence of 
new functional properties and their corresponding maps. These results on V1 maps 
may prove to be a unifying framework for hierarchical representations in the
visual cortex.

Astrocytes are a multifunctional cell type in the nervous system that can
influence neurons and synapses in numerous ways. Astrocytes have been suggested
to play important roles in synapse formation during development, as well as in
multiple forms of synaptic plasticity in the developing and adult brain.
Astrocytes respond to nearby neural activity with elevations in cytosolic calcium
concentration, and in sensory cortex these calcium responses have been shown to
be topographically aligned to neuronal sensory maps. Here, we review recent
evidence for astrocyte interactions with neural circuits, with particular
emphasis on how these interactions may shape the development, arrangement and
plasticity of cortical sensory maps.

During nervous system development, axons, led by the growth cone, must navigate
to their destinations. Axon guidance cues are molecules in the extracellular
environment that attract or repel axons to guide them along their correct
trajectory. The non-conventional axon guidance cues include morphogens of the
Hedgehog, TGF-β/BMP, and Wnt/Wgl families. Canonical signaling by morphogens
regulates transcription in the nucleus to specify cell fate. Recent studies have 
begun to elucidate how these morphogens can also direct growth cone turning,
using signaling mechanisms that diverge from their canonical signaling pathways. 
Furthermore, in addition to directly guiding axons, some non-conventional
guidance cues such as Sonic hedgehog also modulate the response of axons to other
guidance cues, adding another level of regulation to axon guidance.

In the developing nervous system, synaptic connections are formed in excess and
must remodel to achieve the precise synaptic connectivity characteristic of the
mature organism. Synaptic pruning is a developmental process in which subsets of 
synapses are eliminated while the remaining synapses are preserved and
strengthened. Recent findings have demonstrated unexpected roles for glial cells 
in this developmental process. These data demonstrate that phagocytic glia engulf
synaptic and/or axonal elements in the developing nervous system and disruptions 
in this process result in sustained deficits in synaptic connectivity. These new 
findings highlight the importance of glia for nervous system development and
function and may shed new light on mechanisms underlying nervous system disease.

The role of myelin and oligodendrocytes in axonal energy metabolism.

Göttingen, Germany.

In vertebrates, the myelination of long axons by oligodendrocytes and Schwann
cells enables rapid impulse propagation. However, myelin sheaths are not only
passive insulators. Oligodendrocytes are also known to support axonal functions
and long-term integrity. Some of the underlying mechanisms have now been
identified. It could be shown that oligodendrocytes can survive in vivo by
aerobic glycolysis. Myelinating oligodendrocytes release lactate through the
monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. Lactate is then utilized by axons for
mitochondrial ATP generation. Studying axo-glial signalling and energy metabolism
will lead to a better understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, in which
axonal energy metabolism fails. These include neurological disorders as diverse
as multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Several features make the chromatin environment of neurons likely to be different
than any other cell type. These include the fact that several hundred types of
neurons exist, each requiring specialized patterns of gene expression and in turn
specialized chromatin landscapes. In addition, neurons have the most stable
morphology of any cell type, a unique feature essential for memory. Yet these
stable morphologies must allow the emergence of new stable morphologies in
response to environmental influences permitting learning to occur by altered
morphology and new synapse formation. Several years ago we found that neurons
have specific chromatin remodeling mechanisms not present in any other cell type 
that are produced by combinatorial assembly of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes. The neural specific subunits are essential for normal neural
development, learning and memory. Remarkably, recreating these neural specific
complexes in fibroblasts leads to their conversion to neurons. Recently, the
subunits of these complexes have been found to have genetically dominant roles in
several human neurologic diseases. The genetic dominance of these mutations
suggests that less severe mutations will contribute to phenotypic variation in
human neuronally derived traits.

During development, the migration of specific neuronal subtypes is required for
the correct establishment of neural circuits. In mice and zebrafish, facial
branchiomotor (FBM) neurons undergo a tangential migration from rhombomere 4
caudally through the hindbrain. Recent advances in the field have capitalized on 
genetic studies in zebrafish and mouse, and high-resolution time-lapse imaging in
zebrafish. Planar cell polarity signaling has emerged as a critical conserved
factor in FBM neuron migration, functioning both within the neurons and their
environment. In zebrafish, migration depends on specialized 'pioneer' neurons to 
lead follower FBM neurons through the hindbrain, and on interactions with
structural components including pre-laid axon tracts and the basement membrane.
Despite fundamental conservation, species-specific differences in migration
mechanisms are being uncovered.

Stem cells persist in specialized niches in the adult mammalian brain. Emerging
findings highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of different compartments in 
the niche, as well as the presence of local signaling microdomains. Stem cell
quiescence and activation are regulated not only by anchorage to the niche and
diffusible signals, but also by biophysical properties, including fluid dynamics.
Importantly, the adult neural stem cell niche integrates both local and systemic 
changes, reflecting the physiological state of the organism. Moreover niche
signaling is bidirectional, with stem cells and their progeny and niche cells
dynamically interacting with each other during homeostasis, regeneration and
aging.

The insect, annelid and vertebrate forebrains harbour two major centres of output
control, a sensory-neurosecretory centre releasing hormones and a primordial
locomotor centre that controls the initiation of muscular body movements. In
vertebrates, both reside in the hypothalamus. Here, we review recent comparative 
neurodevelopmental evidence indicating that these centres evolved from separate
condensations of neurons on opposite body sides ('apical nervous system' versus
'blastoporal nervous system') and that their developmental specification involved
distinct regulatory networks (apical six3 and rx versus mediolateral nk and pax
gene-dependent patterning). In bilaterian ancestors, both systems approached each
other and became closely intermingled, physically, functionally and
developmentally. Our 'chimeric brain hypothesis' sheds new light on the vast
success and rapid diversification of bilaterian animals in the Cambrian and
revises our understanding of brain architecture.

Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular signaling in
the brain without requiring direct contact between cells. Although exosomes have 
been shown to play a role in neurological diseases and in response to nerve
trauma, a role for exosome-mediated signaling in brain development and function
has not yet been demonstrated. Here we review data building a case for exosome
function in the brain.

College, 1300 York Avenue, Box 60, New York, NY 10065, United States.

The proper function of the nervous system depends on precise production and
connection of distinct neurons and glia. Cell fate determination of neurons and
glia is tightly controlled by complex gene expression regulation in the
developing and adult nervous system. Emerging evidence has demonstrated the
importance of noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) in neural development and function.
This review highlights current discoveries of miRNA functions in specifying
neuronal and glial cell fate. We summarize the roles of miRNAs in expansion and
differentiation of neural stem cells, specification of neuronal subtypes and
glial cells, reprogramming of functional neurons from embryonic stem cells and
fibroblasts, and left-right asymmetric organization of neuronal subtypes.
Investigating the network of interactions between miRNAs and target genes will
reveal new gene regulation machinery involved in tuning the cell fate decisions
of neurons and glia.

During mammalian CNS development, when the neural precursor cells commit to the
neuronal fate they must delaminate and migrate toward the pial surface in order
to reach the appropriate final location. Thus, the coordination of delamination
and fate commitment is important in creating the correct structure. Although
previous studies have proposed that spindle orientation during mitosis plays a
role in both delamination and fate commitment, thus coordinating these events,
subsequent studies have challenged this model. Recent work has identified several
transcriptional mechanisms associated with neurogenesis that inhibit cell
adhesion of newborn neurons and intermediate neuronal progenitors, thereby
triggering delamination and linking it with fate commitment.

What axons tell each other: axon-axon signaling in nerve and circuit assembly.

Grisebachstraße 5, 37077 Göttingen, Germany.

A remarkable feature of nervous system development is the ability of axons
emerging from newly formed neurons to traverse, by cellular scale, colossal
distances to appropriate targets. The earliest axons achieve this in an
essentially axon-free environment, but the vast majority of axons eventually grow
along a scaffold of nerve tracts created by earlier extending axons. Signal
exchange between sequentially or simultaneously extending axons may well
represent the predominant mode of axonal navigation, but proportionally few
efforts have so far been directed at deciphering the underlying mechanisms. This 
review intends to provide a conceptual update on the cellular and molecular
principles driving axon-axon interactions, with emphasis on those contributing to
the fidelity of axonal navigation, sorting and connectivity during nerve and
circuit assembly.

LIS1, the first gene to be identified as involved in a neuronal migration
disease, is a dosage-sensitive gene whose proper levels are required for multiple
aspects of cortical development. Deletions in LIS1 result in a severe brain
malformation, known as lissencephaly, whereas duplications delay brain
development. LIS1 affects the proliferation of progenitors, spindle orientation
and interkinetic nuclear movement in the ventricular zone, as well as
nucleokinesis and migration of neurons. LIS1 regulatory interaction with the
minus end directed molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein is the key for
understanding its complex cellular functions. LIS1-dynein interaction decreases
the average velocity of the molecular motor in vitro, shows more complex effects 
in vivo, and may be of importance in high-load transport especially in neurons.

Cell Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.

Proper circuit connectivity is critical for nervous system function. Connectivity
derives from the interaction of two interdependent modules: synaptic specificity 
and synaptic assembly. Specificity involves both targeting of neurons to specific
laminar regions and the formation of synapses onto defined subcellular areas. In 
this review, we focus discussion on recently elucidated molecular mechanisms that
control synaptic specificity and link them to synapse assembly. We use these
molecular pathways to underscore fundamental cell biological concepts that
underpin, and help explain, the rules governing synaptic specificity.

In peripheral nerves, Schwann cells form myelin, which facilitates the rapid
conduction of action potentials along axons in the vertebrate nervous system.
Myelinating Schwann cells are derived from neural crest progenitors in a
step-wise process that is regulated by extracellular signals and transcription
factors. In addition to forming the myelin sheath, Schwann cells orchestrate much
of the regenerative response that occurs after injury to peripheral nerves. In
response to injury, myelinating Schwann cells dedifferentiate into repair cells
that are essential for axonal regeneration, and then redifferentiate into
myelinating Schwann cells to restore nerve function. Although this remarkable
plasticity has long been recognized, many questions remain unanswered regarding
the signaling pathways regulating both myelination and the Schwann cell response 
to injury.

Despite their predominance in the nervous system, the precise ways in which glial
cells develop and contribute to overall neural function remain poorly defined in 
any organism. Investigations in simple model organisms have identified remarkable
morphological, molecular, and functional similarities between invertebrate and
vertebrate glial subtypes. Invertebrates like Drosophila and Caenorhabditis
elegans offer an abundance of tools for in vivo genetic manipulation of single
cells or whole populations of glia, ease of access to neural tissues throughout
development, and the opportunity for forward genetic analysis of fundamental
aspects of glial cell biology. These features suggest that invertebrate model
systems have high potential for vastly improving the understanding of glial
biology. This review highlights recent work in Drosophila and other invertebrates
that reveal new insights into basic mechanisms involved in glial development.

The ciliated receptive endings of sensory cells and the dendrites of other
neurons are shaped by adhesive interactions, many of which depend on machinery
also present in epithelia. Sensory cells are shaped by interactions with support 
cells through adhesion junctions via the Crumbs complex, tight junction
components such as claudins, as well as interactions with apical extracellular
matrix composed of zona pellucida domain proteins. Neuronal dendrites are shaped 
by adhesion machinery that includes cadherins, catenins, afadin, L1CAM, CHL1,
Sidekicks, Contactin and Caspr, many of which are shared with epithelia. This
review highlights this shared machinery, and suggests that mechanisms of
epithelial morphogenesis may thus provide a guide to understanding dendrite
morphogenesis.

Neuronal synapse formation and maturation in the developing brain is a complex
multi-step process, and it is now clear that glial cells, in particular
astrocytes, are key regulators of neuronal synaptogenesis. This article reviews
the progress made in the past few years in identifying molecular mechanisms that 
glial cells use to regulate neuronal synaptogenesis. The focus is on novel glial 
molecules that induce synapse formation, inhibit synapse formation, or control
synaptic levels of glutamate receptors. A role for glial cells in the pathology
of neurodevelopmental disorders is discussed.

Neurite pruning and neuronal cell death: spatial regulation of shared destruction
programs.

During development, neurons are initially overproduced and excess neurons are
eliminated later on by programmed cell death. In a more refined developmental
process termed pruning, excess axons and dendritic branches are removed while the
cell body remains intact. In mature animals, axons that become disconnected as a 
result of injury are eliminated through a series of events collectively known as 
Wallerian degeneration. Recent evidence points to unexpected similarities between
these three types of obliterative processes, as they share common regulators.
These findings provide new ideas on how cellular destruction programs are
spatially regulated in neurons.

From their initial ingression into the neural tube to the established, adult
vascular plexus, blood vessels within the CNS are truly unique. Covered by a
virtually continuous layer of perivascular cells and astrocytic endfeet and
connected by specialized cell-cell junctional contacts, mature CNS blood vessels 
simultaneously provide nutritive blood flow and protect the neural milieu from
potentially disruptive or harmful molecules and cells flowing through the vessel 
lumen. In this review we will discuss how the CNS vasculature acquires
blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties with a specific focus on recent work
identifying the cell types and molecular pathways that orchestrate
barriergenesis.

Injury to mature neurites triggers a series of events that have both growth
promoting and inhibitory roles. Recent evidence from a variety of experimental
models has revealed new neuronal re-growth modulators. The action of these
modulators must be precisely regulated both in time and space, and involves
multiple cellular processes including retrograde signaling and local translation 
in the injured neurite. New genetic techniques, in combination with
pharmacological approaches, have served to advance mechanistic dissection of
neuronal response to injury. Better understanding of the spatio-temporal cues
would greatly aid in the development of effective regenerative therapies.

Nodes of Ranvier are specialized axonal domains formed in response to a glial
signal. Recent research advances have revealed that both CNS and PNS nodes form
by several overlapping molecular mechanisms. However, the precise nature of these
mechanisms and the hierarchy existing between them is considerably different in
CNS versus PNS nodes. Namely, the Schwann cells of the PNS, which directly
contact the nodal axolemma, secrete proteins that cluster axonodal components at 
the edges of the growing myelin segment. In contrast, the formation of CNS nodes,
which are not contacted by the myelinating glia, is surprisingly similar to the
assembly of the axon initial segment and depends largely on axonal diffusion
barriers.

Over the past decade, developmental neuroscience has been transformed by the
widespread application of confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. Even
greater progress is imminent, as recent innovations in microscopy now enable
imaging with increased depth, speed, and spatial resolution; reduced
phototoxicity; and in some cases without external fluorescent probes. We discuss 
these new techniques and emphasize their dramatic impact on neurobiology,
including the ability to image neurons at depths exceeding 1mm, to observe
neurodevelopment noninvasively throughout embryogenesis, and to visualize
neuronal processes or structures that were previously too small or too difficult 
to target with conventional microscopy.

Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system.
Myelin is essential for the rapid propagation of action potentials as well as for
metabolic support of axons, and its loss in demyelinating diseases like multiple 
sclerosis has profound pathological consequences. The many steps in the
development of OLs - from the specification of oligodendrocyte precursor cells
(OPCs) during embryonic development to their differentiation into OLs that
myelinate axons - are under tight regulation. Here we discuss recent advances in 
understanding how these steps of OL development are controlled intrinsically by
transcription factors and chromatin remodeling and extrinsically by signaling
molecules and neuronal activity. We also discuss how knowledge of these pathways 
is now allowing us to take steps toward generating patient-specific OPCs for
disease modeling and myelin repair.

In the mammalian central nervous system, astrocytes are the most abundant cell
type and play crucial roles in brain development and function. Astrocytes are
known to be produced from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) at the late
gestational stage during brain development, and accumulating evidence indicates
that this stage-dependent generation of astrocytes from NSCs is achieved by
systematic cooperation between environmental cues and cell-intrinsic programs.
Exemplifying the former is cytokine signaling through the gp130-Janus
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, and
exemplifying the latter is epigenetic modification of astrocyte-specific genes.
Here, we introduce recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that
coordinate astrocytogenesis from NSCs by modulating signaling pathways and
epigenetic programs, with a particular focus on the developing mammalian
forebrain.

The molecular basis of restless legs syndrome.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) disrupts sleep in a substantial proportion of the
population and is associated with higher cross-sectional rates of affective
illness and cardiovascular disease. While dopamine and iron availability in the
brain modulate emergence of symptoms, and dopamine agonists and iron alleviate
the sensory symptoms and motor signs of RLS, the biology of the disorder is
incompletely understood. Genetic factors, as opposed to environmental ones,
account for most of the disease variance. The at-risk allelic variants exist in
non-coding regions of at least six genes rendering it a complex genetic disease. 
Nonetheless, these provide the first hypothesis independent clues that advance a 
better understanding of RLS pathophysiology.

Brain circuitry mediating arousal from obstructive sleep apnea.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder of repetitive sleep disruption caused
by reduced or blocked respiratory airflow. Although an anatomically compromised
airway accounts for the major predisposition to OSA, a patient's arousal
threshold and factors related to the central control of breathing (ventilatory
control stability) are also important. Arousal from sleep (defined by EEG
desynchronization) may be the only mechanism that allows airway re-opening
following an obstructive event. However, in many cases arousal is unnecessary and
even worsens the severity of OSA. Mechanisms for arousal are poorly understood.
However, accumulating data are elucidating the relevant neural pathways and
neurotransmitters. For example, serotonin is critically required, but its site of
action is unknown. Important neural substrates for arousal have been recently
identified in the parabrachial complex (PB), a visceral sensory nucleus in the
rostral pons. Moreover, glutamatergic signaling from the PB contributes to
arousal caused by hypercapnia, one of the arousal-promoting stimuli in OSA. A
major current focus of OSA research is to find means to maintain airway patency
during sleep, without sleep interruption.

The major neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by a disabling loss of the
daily pattern of sleep and wakefulness, which may be reflective of a compromise
to the underlying circadian clock that times the sleep cycle. At a molecular
level, the canonical property of neurodegenerative diseases is aberrant
aggregation of otherwise soluble neuronal proteins. They can thus be viewed as
disturbances of proteostasis, raising the question whether the two features -
altered daily rhythms and molecular aggregation - are related. Recent discoveries
have highlighted the fundamental contribution of circadian clocks to the correct 
ordering of daily cellular metabolic cycles, imposing on peripheral organs such
as the liver a strict programme that alternates between anabolic and catabolic
states. The discovery that circadian mechanisms are active in local brain regions
suggests that they may impinge upon physiological and pathological elements that 
influence pro-neurodegenerative aggregation. This review explores how introducing
the dimension of circadian time and the circadian clock might refine the analysis
of aberrant aggregation, thus expanding our perspective on the cell biology
common to neurodegenerative diseases.

A role for clock genes in sleep homeostasis.

The timing and quality of both sleep and wakefulness are thought to be regulated 
by the interaction of two processes. One of these two processes keeps track of
the prior sleep-wake history and controls the homeostatic need for sleep while
the other sets the time-of-day that sleep preferably occurs. The molecular
pathways underlying the latter, circadian process have been studied in detail and
their key role in physiological time-keeping has been well established. Analyses 
of sleep in mice and flies lacking core circadian clock gene proteins have
demonstrated, however, that besides disrupting circadian rhythms, also sleep
homeostatic processes were affected. Subsequent studies revealed that sleep loss 
alters both the mRNA levels and the specific DNA-binding of the key circadian
transcriptional regulators to their target sequences in the mouse brain. The fact
that sleep loss impinges on the very core of the molecular circadian circuitry
might explain why both inadequate sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms can
similarly lead to metabolic pathology. The evidence for a role for clock genes in
sleep homeostasis will be reviewed here.

Neuromodulatory control of sleep in Drosophila melanogaster: integration of

The transition between wake and sleep states is characterized by rapid and
generalized changes in both sensory and motor processing. Sleep is antagonistic
to the expression of important behaviors, like feeding, reproduction and learning
whose relative importance to an individual will depend on its circumstances at
that moment. An understanding of how the decision to sleep is affected by these
other drives and how this process is coordinated across the entire brain remains 
elusive. Neuromodulation is an important regulatory feature of many behavioral
circuits and the reconfiguring of these circuits by modulators can have both
long-term and short-term consequences. Drosophila melanogaster has become an
important model system for understanding the molecular and genetic bases of
behaviors and in recent years neuromodulatory systems have been shown to play a
major role in regulation of sleep and other behaviors in this organism. The fly, 
with its increasingly well-defined behavioral circuitry and powerful genetic
tools, is a system poised to provide new insight into the complex issue of how
neuromodulation can coordinate situation-specific behavioral needs with the
brain's arousal state.

Daily rhythms in animal behavior, physiology and metabolism are driven by
cell-autonomous clocks that are synchronized by environmental cycles, but
maintain ∼24 hours rhythms even in the absence of environmental cues. These
clocks keep time and control overt rhythms via interlocked transcriptional
feedback loops, making it imperative to define the mechanisms that drive rhythmic
transcription within these loops and on a genome-wide scale. Recent work
identifies novel post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that
govern progression through these feedback loops to maintain a period of ∼24
hours. Likewise, new microarray and deep sequencing studies reveal interplay
among clock activators, chromatin remodeling and RNA Pol II binding to set the
phase of gene transcription and drive post-transcriptional regulatory systems
that may greatly increase the proportion of genes that are under clock control.
Despite great progress, gaps in our understanding of how feedback loop
transcriptional programs maintain ∼24 hours cycles and drive overt rhythms
remain.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime
sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagonic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed 
nocturnal sleep patterns. Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin
(orexin)-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Evidence, such as a
strong association with HLA DQB1*06:02, strongly suggests an autoimmune basis
targeting hypocretin neurons. Genome-wide association studies have strengthened
the association between narcolepsy and immune system gene polymorphisms,
including the identification of polymorphisms in the T cell receptor alpha locus,
TNFSF4 (also called OX40L), Cathepsin H (CTSH) the purinergic receptor P2RY11,
and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Recently, attention has been raised
regarding a spike in cases of childhood narcolepsy in 2010 following the 2009
H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) in China and vaccination with Pandemrix, an adjuvanted H1N1
vaccine that was used in Europe. How the immune system may be involved in disease
initiation and/or progression remains a challenge to researchers. Potential
immunological pathways that could lead to the specific elimination of hypocretin 
producing neurons include molecular mimicry or bystander activation, and are
likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as upper airway
infections.

Small molecules have been used since antiquity to regulate our sleep. Despite the
explosion of diverse drugs to treat problems of too much or too little sleep, the
detailed mechanisms of action and especially the neuronal targets by which these 
compounds alter human behavioural states are not well understood. Research
efforts in model systems such as mouse, zebrafish and fruit fly are combining
conditional genetics and optogenetics with pharmacology to map the effects of
sleep-promoting drugs onto neural circuits. Recent studies raise the possibility 
that many small molecules alter sleep and wake via specific sets of critical
neurons rather than through the global modulation of multiple brain targets.
These findings also uncover novel brain areas as sleep/wake regulators and
indicate that the development of circuit-selective drugs might alleviate sleep
disorders with fewer side effects.

It has been known since the 1970s that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the
brain's main biological clock, and since the 1990s that it uses a genetic clock
based on transcriptional-translational loops to tell time. However, the recent
demonstration that many other cells in the brain and the body also make use of
the same genetic clock raises the question of how the SCN synchronizes all of the
other clocks to arrive at a coherent circadian profile of physiology and
behavior. In this review, we re-examine the evidence that the SCN clock is
necessary for bringing order to the body's biological rhythms, and the circuitry 
of the circadian timing system by which it accomplishes this goal. Finally, we
review the evidence that under conditions of restricted food availability, other 
clocks may be able to take over from the SCN to determine rhythms of behavior and
physiology.

Why do we need to sleep? What regulates when we sleep? And what dictates the
number of hours we require? These are often viewed as three separate biological
questions. Here, we propose they share molecular etiologies, whereby regulators
of sleep schedules and sleep duration also govern the physiological purposes of
sleep. To support our hypothesis, we review Mendelian human genetic variants
sufficient to advance sleep-wake onset (PER2) and shorten sleep length (DEC2),
and evaluate their emerging roles in immune responses that may rely on a sound
night of slumber.

The orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus play an essential role
in promoting arousal and maintaining wakefulness. These neurons receive a broad
variety of signals related to environmental, physiological and emotional stimuli;
they project to almost every brain region involved in the regulation of
wakefulness; and they fire most strongly during active wakefulness, high motor
activation, and sustained attention. This review focuses on the specific neuronal
pathways through which the orexin neurons promote wakefulness and maintain high
level of arousal, and how recent studies using optogenetic and pharmacogenetic
methods have demonstrated that the locus coeruleus, the tuberomammillary nucleus,
and the basal forebrain are some of the key sites mediating the arousing actions 
of orexins.

Orexin deficiency results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy in many mammalian
species, including mice, dogs, and humans, suggesting that the orexin system is
particularly important for normal regulation of sleep/wakefulness states, and
especially for maintenance of wakefulness. This review discusses animal models of
narcolepsy; the contribution of each orexin receptor subtype to the narcoleptic
phenotypes; and the etiology of orexin neuronal death. It also raises the
possibility of novel therapies targeting the orexin system for sleep disorders
including insomia and narcolepsy-cataplexy.

Several recent studies, using molecular, electrophysiological, or structural
approaches, have investigated how synapses are affected by sleep, spontaneous
wake, chronic sleep restriction, and acute sleep deprivation. Overall, the
results have found that even a few hours of sleep or wake can modify the
molecular composition of excitatory synapses, change their efficacy, and make
synapses grow or shrink. Moreover, partial and total loss of sleep affect the
ability of synapses to undergo long-term potentiation, an effect that may
underlie some of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation on memory and
other cognitive functions.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a common feature in many
neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
depression. Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, recent evidence
suggests that this comorbidity is not simply a product of medication or an
absence of social routine, but instead reflects commonly affected underlying
pathways and mechanisms. For example, several genes intimately involved in the
generation and regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep have been linked to
psychiatric illness. Further, several genes linked to mental illness have
recently been shown to also play a role in normal sleep and circadian behaviour. 
Here we describe some of the emerging common mechanisms that link circadian
rhythms, sleep and SCRD in severe mental illnesses. A deeper understanding of
these links will provide not only a greater understanding of disease mechanisms, 
but also holds the promise of novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.

It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only
one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep
and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through
multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.
Finally, sleep stages per se do not affect memories. Rather, the neuromodulatory 
and electrophysiological events that characterize these sleep stages must mediate
sleep-dependent memory processing. In this review, we attempt to parse out the
relative contributions and interactions of these often frustratingly complex
systems.

The biochemical basis of circadian timekeeping is best characterized in
cyanobacteria. The structures of its key molecular players, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC 
are known and these proteins can reconstitute a remarkable circadian oscillation 
in a test tube. KaiC is rhythmically phosphorylated and its phospho-status is a
marker of circadian phase that regulates ATPase activity and the oscillating
assembly of a nanomachine. Analyses of the nanomachines have revealed how their
timing circuit is ratcheted to be unidirectional and how they stay in synch to
ensure a robust oscillator. These insights are likely to elucidate circadian
timekeeping in higher organisms, including how transcription and translation
could appear to be a core circadian timer when the true pacemaker is an embedded 
biochemical oscillator.

Caenorhabditis elegans is the simplest animal shown to sleep. It sleeps during
lethargus, a larval transition stage. Behavior during lethargus has the sleep
properties of a specific quiescent posture and elevated arousal threshold that
are reversible to strong stimulation and of increased sleep drive following sleep
deprivation. Genetic similarities between sleep regulation during C. elegans
lethargus and sleep regulation in other animals point to a sleep state that was
an evolutionarily ancestor to sleep both in C. elegans and other animals. Recent 
publications have shed light on key questions in sleep biology: First, How is
sleep regulated? Second, How is sensory information gated during sleep? Third,
How is sleep homeostasis mediated? Fourth, What is the core function of sleep?

The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and at least two other
unidentified central pacemakers regulate the temporal structure of a circadian
network that involves almost every organ in the body. Phase control is central to
the efficient function of this system. Individual circadian oscillators in
tissues and organs in the periphery bear adaptive phase relationships to the
external light cycle, the central pacemakers and to each other. The known signals
that regulate and maintain these phase relationships come from the autonomic
nervous system, the pineal and adrenal glands, behavioral cycles of feeding and
activity and the rhythm of body temperature. It is likely that there are many
unknown signals as well. Disrupting the network can produce severe pathology.

Lifestyles involving sleep deprivation are common, despite mounting evidence that
both acute total sleep deprivation and chronically restricted sleep degrade
neurobehavioral functions associated with arousal, attention, memory and state
stability. Current research suggests dynamic differences in the way the central
nervous system responds to acute versus chronic sleep restriction, which is
reflected in new models of sleep-wake regulation. Chronic sleep restriction
likely induces long-term neuromodulatory changes in brain physiology that could
explain why recovery from it may require more time than from acute sleep loss.
High intraclass correlations in neurobehavioral responses to sleep loss suggest
that these trait-like differences are phenotypic and may include genetic
components. Sleep deprivation induces changes in brain metabolism and neural
activation that involve distributed networks and connectivity.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.

Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a failure of the
circuitry regulating motor atonia during REM sleep. In REM sleep, neurons of the 
sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) project to interneurons in the
ventromedial medulla (VMM) and spinal cord that in turn inhibit spinal
motoneurons. In RBD, degeneration of this circuitry disinhibits phasic motor
commands originating from motor generators. The resulting behavior ranges from
simple twitches or jerks to complex behavior. Simple behaviors in RBD may
originate from cortical, brainstem and spinal cord motor generators, while
complex behavior may originate from cortical motor generators, possibly related
to dream content in REM sleep. While RBD can occur idiopathically, it is usually 
comorbid with or a precursor to a synucleinopathy such as Parkinson's disease
(PD). RBD can precede the onset of PD by decades, suggesting an underlying
pathology that can progressively afflict REM atonia and midbrain dopaminergic
centers. The relative recovery of motor function during REM sleep in some of the 
cases of PD with RBD emphasizes the complexity of motor pathway control during
wakefulness and REM sleep.

Mammalian sleep is regulated by two distinct mechanisms. A circadian oscillator
provides timing signals that organize sleep and wake across the 24 hour day. A
homeostatic mechanism increases sleep drive and sleep amounts (or intensity) as a
function of prior time awake. The cellular mechanisms of sleep homeostasis are
poorly defined, but are thought to be primarily neuronal. According to one view, 
sleep homeostasis arises from interactions between subcortical neurons that
register sleep pressure and other neurons that promote either sleep or
wakefulness. Alternatively, sleep drive may arise independently among neurons
throughout the brain in a use-dependent fashion. Implicit in both views is the
idea that sleep homeostasis is solely the product of neurons. In this article, I 
discuss an emerging view that glial astrocytes may play an essential role in
sleep homeostasis.

Research on sleep homeostasis aims to answer the question: how does the brain
measure the duration and intensity of previous wakefulness in order to increase
the duration and intensity of subsequent sleep? The search of regulatory factors 
has identified a number of potential molecules that increase their concentration 
in waking and decrease it during sleep. These factors regulate many physiological
functions, including energy metabolism, neural plasticity and immune functions
and one molecule may participate in the regulation of all these functions. The
method to study regulation of sleep homeostasis is experimental prolongation of
waking, which is used also to address the question of physiological purpose of
sleep: prolonging wakefulness provokes symptoms that tell us what goes wrong
during lack of sleep. The interpretation of the role of each identified factor in
the regulation of sleep/sleep homeostasis reflects the theoretical background
concept of the research. Presently three main concepts are being actively
studied: the energy (depletion) hypothesis, the neural plasticity hypothesis and 
the (immune) defense hypothesis.

The purpose of this review is to outline our latest hypothesis on the mechanisms 
responsible for the genesis of paradoxical (REM) sleep (PS). On the basis of
recent data, we propose that the onset and maintenance of PS are due to the
activation by intrinsic and extrinsic factors of MCH/GABAergic neurons located in
the lateral hypothalamic area. These neurons would inhibit during PS, GABAergic
PS-off neurons located in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray region. A number 
of results strongly suggest that these PS-off neurons gate the activation of the 
PS-on glutamatergic neurons located in the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus
(SLD) and responsible for cortical activation and muscle atonia via descending
projections to GABA/glycinergic neurons localized in the ventral medullary
reticular nuclei.

The basal ganglia (BG) act as a cohesive functional unit that regulates motor
function, habit formation, and reward/addictive behaviors, but the debate has

achieve all these fundamental functions of the BG. Neurotoxic lesioning,

animals revealed that the striatum and globus pallidus are important for the
control of sleep and wakefulness. Here, we discuss anatomical and molecular
mechanisms for sleep-wake regulation in the BG and propose a plausible model in
which the nucleus accumbens integrates behavioral processes with wakefulness
through adenosine and dopamine receptors.

The reciprocal interactions between sleep and immune function are well-studied.
Insufficient sleep induces innate immune responses as evidenced by increased
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the brain and periphery. Conversely, 
immune challenges upregulate immunomodulator expression, which alters central
nervous system-mediated processes and behaviors, including sleep. Recent studies 
indicate that glial cells, namely microglia and astrocytes, are active
contributors to sleep and immune system interactions. Evidence suggests glial
regulation of these interactions is mediated, in part, by adenosine and adenosine
5'-triphosphate actions at purinergic type 1 and type 2 receptors. Furthermore,
microglia and astrocytes may modulate declines in sleep-wake behavior and
immunity observed in aging.

The efficacy of medications for alcohol dependence remains modest, and there are 
no strong clinical predictors of treatment response. Approved medications include
acamprosate (an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA) modulator), disulfiram (an
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) while
nalmefene (an opioid antagonist) is currently under review for approval in
Europe. Clinical trials suggest that baclofen (a GABA-B agonist) and topiramate
(an anticonvulsant) may be promising candidates, while several other drug
candidates are currently evaluated at early clinical stages.

Drug craving has re-emerged as a relevant and important construct in the
pathophysiology of addiction with its inclusion in DSM-V as a key clinical
symptom of addictive disorders. This renewed focus has been due in part to the
recent neurobiological evidence on craving-related neural activation and clinical
evidence supporting its association with drug use, relapse, and recovery
processes. This review covers the neurobiology of drug craving and relapse risk
with a primary focus on cocaine addiction and a secondary emphasis on alcohol
addiction. A conceptualization of drug craving on the continuum of healthy desire
and compulsive seeking, and the associated neurobiological adaptations associated
with the development of an increased craving/wanting state is presented. Altered 
dopamine neurochemistry as well as disrupted prefrontal control and hyperactive
striatal-limbic responses in experiencing drug cues, stress, drug intake and in
basal relaxed states are identified as neurobiological signatures that predict
drug craving and drug use. Thus, the clinical and neurobiological features of the
craving/wanting state are presented with specific attention to alterations in
these cortico-limbic-striatal and prefrontal self-control circuits that predict
drug craving and relapse risk. The methodological challenges that need to be
addressed to further develop the evolving conceptual approach to the neuroscience
of drug craving is presented, with a focus on identification and validation of
biomarkers associated with the craving state and treatment approaches that may be
of benefit in reversing the neurobiological adaptations associated with drug
craving to improve treatment outcomes in addiction.

Drug addiction and obesity share the core feature that those afflicted by the
disorders express a desire to limit drug or food consumption yet persist despite 
negative consequences. Emerging evidence suggests that the compulsivity that
defines these disorders may arise, to some degree at least, from common
underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In particular, both disorders are
associated with diminished striatal dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) availability,
likely reflecting their decreased maturation and surface expression. In striatum,
D2Rs are expressed by approximately half of the principal medium spiny projection
neurons (MSNs), the striatopallidal neurons of the so-called 'indirect' pathway. 
D2Rs are also expressed presynaptically on dopamine terminals and on cholinergic 
interneurons. This heterogeneity of D2R expression has hindered attempts, largely
using traditional pharmacological approaches, to understand their contribution to
compulsive drug or food intake. The emergence of genetic technologies to target
discrete populations of neurons, coupled to optogenetic and chemicogenetic tools 
to manipulate their activity, have provided a means to dissect striatopallidal
and cholinergic contributions to compulsivity. Here, we review recent evidence
supporting an important role for striatal D2R signaling in compulsive drug use
and food intake. We pay particular attention to striatopallidal projection
neurons and their role in compulsive responding for food and drugs. Finally, we
identify opportunities for future obesity research using known mechanisms of
addiction as a heuristic, and leveraging new tools to manipulate activity of
specific populations of striatal neurons to understand their contributions to
addiction and obesity.

Addiction is a chronically relapsing brain disorder that insidiously affects the 
motivational and cognitive control systems of susceptible individuals. Clinical
research over the last two decades has profited from the technique of positron
emission tomography (PET), a non-invasive imaging technique that allows the
longitudinal assessment of addiction-relevant biomarkers in current and former
drug users. The vast majority of this research has unsurprisingly focused on the 
brain dopamine (DA) systems given their pivotal role in primary drug
reinforcement and the rich abundance of dopaminergic PET tracers. However, the
provocative failure of dopaminergic medications in addiction has fuelled the
search for alternative treatments. This article considers current controversies
in this field as well as prospects for elucidating neurotransmitter mechanisms in
addiction beyond DA.

Research on alcohol and drug dependence has shown that the development of
addiction depends on a complex interplay of psychological factors, genetic or
epigenetic predisposing factors, and neurobiological adaptations induced by drug 
consumption. A greater understanding of the mechanisms leading to alcohol abuse
will allow researchers to identify genetic variation that corresponds to a
specific biological vulnerability to addiction, thus defining robust
endophenotypes that might help deconstruct these complex syndromes into more
tractable components. To this end, it is critical to develop a translational
framework that links alterations at the molecular level, to changes in neuronal
function, and ultimately to changes at the behavioral and clinical levels.
Translational phenotypes can be identified by the combination of animal and human
studies designed to elucidate the neurofunctional, anatomical and pharmacological
mechanisms underlying the etiology of alcohol addiction. The present article
offers an overview of medication development in alcoholism with a focus on the
critical aspect of translational research. Moreover, significant examples of
promising targets from neuropeptidergic systems, namely nociceptin/orphanin FQ
and neuropeptide S are given.

Negative reinforcement in drug addiction: the darkness within.

Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA. gkoob@scripps.edu

Drug seeking is associated with the activation of reward neural circuitry, but I 
argue that drug addiction also involves another major source of reinforcement,
specifically negative reinforcement driven by the 'dark side' (i.e., a decrease
in the function of normal reward-related neurocircuitry and persistent
recruitment of the brain stress systems). This combination forms the antireward
system or 'darkness within.' Understanding the neuroplasticity of the
neurocircuitry that comprises the negative reinforcement associated with
addiction is the key to understanding the vulnerability to the transition to
addiction, misery of addiction, and persistence of addiction.

Substance-specific environmental influences on drug use and drug preference in
animals and humans.

Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Rome 00185, Italy. aldo.badiani@uniroma1.it

Epidemiological, clinical, and preclinical evidence indicate that the setting of 
drug use can exert a powerful modulatory influence on drug reward and that this
influence is substance-specific. When heroin and cocaine co-abusers, for example,
report on the circumstances of drug use, they indicate distinct settings for the 
two drugs: heroin being used preferentially at home and cocaine being used
preferentially outside the home. Similar results were obtained in laboratory
rats. These findings will be interpreted in the light of a novel model of drug
reward, based on the emotional appraisal of central and peripheral drug effects
as a function of environmental context. I argue here that drug addiction research
has not paid sufficient attention to the substance-specific aspects of drug abuse
and this may have contributed to the present dearth of effective treatments.
Pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example, should be tailored
so as to allow the addict to anticipate, and cope with, the risks associated, in 
a substance-specific manner, to the different settings of drug use.

Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity: beyond metaplasticity.

Creed MC(1), Lüscher C.

1211 Geneva, Switzerland.

Addictive drugs such as cocaine induce synaptic plasticity in the ventral
tegmental area and its projection areas, which may represent the cellular
correlate of an addiction trace. Cocaine induces changes in excitatory
transmission primarily in the VTA, which persists for days after a single
exposure. These initial alterations in synaptic transmission represent a
metaplasticity that is permissive for late stages of remodeling throughout the
mesocorticolimbic circuitry, specifically in the NAc. Specific synaptic and
cellular changes in the NAc persist following prolonged exposure to cocaine, and 
this remodeling may contribute to altered behavior. By manipulating synaptic
activity in the NAc, it may be possible to reverse pathological synaptic
transmission and its associated abnormal behavior following exposure to addictive
drugs.

Unraveling the neurobiology of nicotine dependence using genetically engineered
mice.

Stoker AK(1), Markou A.

Author information:

Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0603, USA.

This review article provides an overview of recent studies of nicotine dependence
and withdrawal that used genetically engineered mice. Major progress has been
made in recent years with mutant mice that have knockout and gain-of-function of 
specific neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit genes.
Nicotine exerts its actions by binding to neuronal nAChRs that consist of five
subunits. The different nAChR subunits that combine to compose a receptor
determine the distinct pharmacological and kinetic properties of the specific
nAChR. Recent findings in genetically engineered mice have indicated that while
α4-containing and β2-containing nAChRs are involved in the acquisition of
nicotine self-administration and initial stages of nicotine dependence, α7
homomeric nAChRs appear to be involved in the later stages of nicotine
dependence. In the medial habenula, α5-containing, α3-containing, and
β4-containing nAChRs were shown to be crucially important in the regulation of
the aversive aspects of nicotine. Studies of the involvement of α6 nAChR subunits
in nicotine dependence have only recently emerged. The use of genetically
engineered mice continues to vastly improve our understanding of the neurobiology
of nicotine dependence and withdrawal.

USA. marc.potenza@yale.edu

For many, gambling is a recreational activity that is performed periodically
without ill effects, but for some, gambling may interfere with life functioning. 
A diagnostic entity, pathological gambling (PG), is currently used to define a
condition marked by excessive and problematic gambling. In this review, the
current status of understanding of the neurobiologies of gambling and PG is
described. Multiple neurotransmitter systems (norepinephrine, serotonin,
dopamine, opioid and glutamate) and brain regions (ventral striatum, ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, insula, among others) have been implicated in gambling and PG.
Considerations for future directions in gambling research, with a view towards
translating neurobiological advances into more effective prevention and treatment
strategies, are discussed.

Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Most adults in Western society consume alcohol on a regular basis with few or no 
negative consequences. However, for certain individuals, alcohol use escalates,
leading to uncontrolled drinking bouts, craving, and repeated episodes of
relapse. The transition from regulated to uncontrolled and compulsive drinking is
a defining feature (i.e. an endophenotype) of alcohol addiction. This behavioral 
progression can be modeled in rodent paradigms that parallel the diagnostic
criteria for addiction in humans. Using these criteria as a framework, this
review outlines the neurobiological factors associated with increased
vulnerability to excessive, compulsive, and dysregulated alcohol intake in
rodents. We conclude by noting gaps in the literature and outline important
directions for future research.

Ascending orexinergic pathways and alcohol-seeking.

Brown RM(1), Lawrence AJ.

Author information: 
(1)Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health, University of Melbourne,
Parkville, Australia.

Orexin (hypocretin) containing neurons reside in discrete regions of the lateral 
hypothalamus from where they innervate the entire neuroaxis. Via actions upon
orexin receptors (OX1 and OX2), the orexin peptides (orexin A and orexin B) are
thought to play a role in ethanol consumption and seeking. While a role for OX1
receptors in these behaviours is established, the case for OX2 receptors is less 
clear at present, although recent data certainly support an involvement of OX2
receptors in ethanol consumption. In terms of circuitry, orexin receptors the
ventral tegmental area appear to contribute to ethanol consumption. Other loci
remain to be characterised, and we suggest prefrontal cortical orexin receptors
deserve attention in this respect.

Surgical treatment for psychiatric disorders has been revitalized for the past
ten years after deep brain stimulation (DBS) had shown its efficacy for the
treatment of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In the field of 
psychiatric disorders, DBS has been first used for obsessive compulsive disorder 
and treatment-resistant depression. Only recently it has been proposed for the
treatment of addiction. Whatever the disease, the selected target is a constant
question. In this review, we present theoretical, empirical and technical
arguments in favor of targeting the subthalamic nucleus as the best candidate
over other areas for DBS in the treatment of drug addiction.

Identifying the molecular basis of inhibitory control deficits in addictions:
neuroimaging in non-human primates.

States.

Deep insights into the structural, molecular and functional phenotypes underlying
addiction have been made possible through in vivo neuroimaging techniques
implemented in non-human and human primates. In addition to providing evidence
that many of the neural alterations detected in stimulant-dependent individuals
can emerge solely through experience with drugs, these studies have identified
potential biological phenotypes that influence addiction liability. Here, we
review recent advances that have been made in understanding the pathophysiology
of stimulant addiction using neuroimaging techniques in non-human primates.
Evidence indicates that dysfunction of the dopamine system can be both a cause
and consequence of stimulant use and that this bi-directional relationship may be
mediated by the ability of individuals to exert inhibitory control over
behaviors. Further, recent data has demonstrated an involvement of the serotonin 
system in addiction-related behaviors and neurobiology, suggesting that the
relationship between dopamine and serotonin systems may be altered in addiction. 
This approach aids in the development of novel targets that can be used in the
treatment of addiction.

Since the first study in stimulant-dependent individuals using structural MRI was
published fifteen years ago, much evidence has accumulated on brain abnormalities
associated with stimulant drug dependence. Here we conducted a voxel-based
morphometry meta-analysis of published MRI data in stimulant-dependent
individuals to clarify the most robust abnormalities underlying the disorder. We 
found that neuroimaging studies in stimulant-dependent individuals consistently
report a gray matter decline in the prefrontal cortex regions associated with
self-regulation and self-awareness. One of the next key questions that
neuroimaging research today needs to address is the question of causality, namely
to what extent these brain abnormalities are caused by the toxic effects of drug 
exposure, or the possibility that these may have predated drug-taking and even
predisposed individuals for the development of drug dependence. Although the
question of causality has not yet been answered completely, there has been
significant progress made to date.

The neurobiology of successful abstinence.

This review focuses on the neurobiological processes involved in achieving
successful abstinence from drugs of abuse. While there is clinical and public
health value in knowing if the deficits associated with drug use correct with
abstinence, studying the neurobiology that underlies successful abstinence can
also illuminate the processes that enable drug-dependent individuals to
successfully quit. Here, we review studies on human addicts that assess the
neurobiological changes that arise with abstinence and the neurobiological
predictors of successfully avoiding relapse. The literature, while modest in
size, suggests that abstinence is associated with improvement in prefrontal
structure and function, which may underscore the importance of prefrontally
mediated cognitive control processes in avoiding relapse. Given the implication
that the prefrontal cortex may be an important target for therapeutic
interventions, we also review evidence indicating the efficacy of cognitive
control training for abstinence.

The involvement of the endocannabinoid system in drug addiction was initially
studied by the use of compounds with different affinities for each cannabinoid
receptor or for the proteins involved in endocannabinoids inactivation. The
generation of genetically modified mice with selective mutations in these
endocannabinoid system components has now provided important advances in
establishing their specific contribution to drug addiction. These genetic tools
have identified the particular interest of CB1 cannabinoid receptor and
endogenous anandamide as potential targets for drug addiction treatment. Novel
genetic tools will allow determining if the modulation of CB2 cannabinoid
receptor activity and 2-arachidonoylglycerol tone can also have an important
therapeutic relevance for drug addiction.

Cannabis is the world's most widely used illicit substance, with an estimated
number of 119-224 million users worldwide. In recent years we assisted to an
increased effort aimed to individuate the brain circuits underlying cannabis
addiction and dependence. Similarly to other drugs of abuse, repeated exposure to
cannabinoids causes brain neuroadaptations that persist long after drug effects, 
contribute to the negative affective states during withdrawal, and ultimately
facilitate relapse. Recently, considerable progress has been made in
understanding the cellular and molecular consequences of prolonged cannabis use, 
among which is the identification of specific set of transcriptional regulations 
that develop differently after chronic cannabinoids and in the abstinent brain.

Drug dependence in humans is often accompanied by behavioral disturbances such as
maladaptive levels of impulsivity. In turn, there is accumulating evidence from
preclinical laboratory animal and clinical studies indicating that impulsive
behavior might be causally linked to several distinct processes in drug
addiction, including the onset, maintenance and relapsing nature of drug use.
This leads to the question as to whether pharmacological or behavioral approaches
aimed at ameliorating impulsivity might prove effective therapeutic interventions
in human drug dependence. This paper reviews evidence for an important role of
impulsivity as a determinant of drug dependence with a particular focus on
relapse vulnerability and addresses the implications of these findings for the
clinical management of relapse prevention.

Alcohol addiction is a complex, unique human disease. Breaking addiction down
into contributing endophenotypes enables its study in a variety of model systems.
The Drosophila model system has been most often used to study alcohol
sensitivity, tolerance, and physiological dependence. However, none of these
endophenotypes can account for the near-permanent quality of the addicted state. 
It has been recently discussed that addictive drugs may hijack the
learning-and-memory machinery to produce persistent behavioral changes. Learning 
and memory is amenable to experimental study, and provides us with a window into 
how alcohol affects higher-order mental functions that are likely to contribute
compulsive drug use. Here, we review the Drosophila literature that links
alcohol-related behaviors to learning and memory.

The multiple facets of opioid receptor function: implications for addiction.

Addiction is characterized by altered reward processing, disrupted emotional
responses and poor decision-making. Beyond a central role in drug reward,
increasing evidence indicate that opioid receptors are broadly involved in all
these processes. Recent studies establish the mu opioid receptor as a main player
in social reward, which attracts increasing attention in psychiatric research.
There is growing interest in blocking the kappa opioid receptor to prevent
relapse, and alleviate the negative affect of withdrawal. The delta opioid
receptor emerges as a potent mood enhancer, whose involvement in addiction is
less clear. All three opioid receptors are likely implicated in
addiction-depression comorbidity, and understanding of their roles in cognitive
deficits associated to drug abuse is only beginning.

Addiction: failure of control over maladaptive incentive habits.

Drug addiction may be associated with a loss of executive control over
maladaptive incentive habits. We hypothesize that these incentive habits result
from a pathological coupling of drug-influenced motivational states and a rigid
stimulus-response habit system by which drug-associated stimuli through automatic
processes elicit and maintain drug seeking. Neurally, incentive habits may depend
upon an interaction between the basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens core, 
together with the progressive development of a ventral-to-dorsolateral striatum
functional coupling through the recruitment of striato-nigro-striatal
dopamine-dependent loop circuitry. Recent evidence suggests that both ventral
striatal and central nucleus pathways from the amygdala may be required for the
recruitment of DLS-dependent control over habitual behavior.

Austin, TX 78712, USA.

Molecular and behavioral studies corroborate a pivotal role for the innate immune
system in mediating the acute and chronic effects of alcohol and support a
neuroimmune hypothesis of alcohol addiction. Changes in expression of neuroimmune
genes and microglial transcripts occur in postmortem brain from alcoholics and
animals exposed to alcohol, and null mutant animals lacking certain innate immune
genes show decreased alcohol-mediated responses. Many of the differentially
expressed genes are part of the toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and
culminate in an increased expression of pro-inflammatory immune genes. Compounds 
known to inhibit inflammation, microglial activation, and neuroimmune gene
expression have shown promising results in reducing alcohol-mediated behaviors in
animal models, indicating that neuroimmune signaling pathways offer unexplored
targets in the treatment of alcohol abuse.

Through sequential waves of drug-induced neurochemical stimulation, addiction
co-opts the brain's neuronal circuits that mediate reward, motivation to
behavioral inflexibility and a severe disruption of self-control and compulsive
drug intake. Brain imaging technologies have allowed neuroscientists to map out
the neural landscape of addiction in the human brain and to understand how drugs 
modify it.

Neurobiology of addiction versus drug use driven by lack of choice.

Research on the neurobiology of addiction often involves nonhuman animals that
are given ready access to drugs for self-administration but without other
choices. Here we argue using cocaine as an example that this standard setting may
no longer be sufficient and can even lead to the formulation of unrealistic views
about the neurobiology of addiction. Addiction as a psychiatric disorder is
defined as resulting from brain dysfunctions that affect normal choice-making,
not as an expectable response to lack of alternative choices. We encourage
neurobiologists involved in addiction research to increase animals' choice during
drug access, preferably by supplying alternative rewarding pursuits. Only animals
that continue to take and prefer drugs despite and at the expense of other
available choices may be considered as having developed an addiction-like
behavior in comparison to those that remain able to stop drug use for other
pursuits, even after extended drug use. The systematic comparison of these two
individual behaviors should reveal new insights about the neurobiology of drug
choice and addiction. More generally, this research should also shed a unique
light on how the brain 'chooses' among qualitatively different kinds of pursuits.

Cocaine-induced adaptations in D1 and D2 accumbens projection neurons (a
dichotomy not necessarily synonymous with direct and indirect pathways).

Cocaine exposure causes enduring neuroadaptations in ventral striatum, or nucleus
accumbens (NAc), an area critically involved in reward learning and relapse of
drug seeking. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in striatum are dichotomous in their
expression of either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors, along with other receptors and 
neuropeptides. In dorsal striatum, these two subpopulations show non-overlapping 
innervation of distinct terminal fields via the direct or indirect pathways.
However, NAc D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs are not fully segregated in this manner, with
both cell types innervating ventral pallidum. Recent studies show that D1-MSNs
and D2-MSNs play opposing roles in cocaine-associated behaviors. Further, cocaine
induces differential adaptations in these two subpopulations in NAc, including
changes to synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic signaling, and spine morphology.

Neurons rely on their cytoskeleton to give them shape and stability, and on
cytoskeletal dynamics for growth and synaptic plasticity. Because drug addiction 
is increasingly seen as the inappropriate learning of strongly reinforcing
stimuli, the role of the cytoskeleton in shaping drug memories has been of
increasing interest in recent years. Does the cytoskeleton have an active role in
shaping these memories, and to what extent do alterations in the cytoskeleton
reflect the acute actions of drug exposure, or homeostatic reactions to the
chronic exposure to drugs of abuse? Here we will review recent advances in
understanding the role of the cytoskeleton in the development of drug addiction, 
with a focus on actin filaments, as they have been studied in greater detail.

Addiction: a drug-induced disorder of memory reconsolidation.

Persistent maladaptive memories that maintain drug seeking and are resistant to
extinction are a hallmark of addiction. As such, disruption of memory
reconsolidation after retrieval has received attention for its therapeutic
potential. Unrestrained reconsolidation may have the opposite effect, leading to 
reiterative and cumulative strengthening of memory over long periods of time.
Here we review the molecular mechanisms underlying reconsolidation of appetitive 
and drug-rewarded memories, and discuss how these findings contribute to our
understanding of the nature of this process. Finally, we suggest that
drug-induced alterations to signal transduction might lead to dysregulation of
reconsolidation, causing enhancements of drug-related memory after retrieval, and
significantly contribute to the compulsive drug seeking that is a core component 
of addiction.

Recent concepts of addiction to drugs (e.g. cocaine) and non-drugs (e.g.
gambling) have proposed that these behaviors are the product of an imbalance
between three separate, but interacting, neural systems: an impulsive, largely
amygdala-striatum dependent, neural system that promotes automatic, habitual and 
salient behaviors; a reflective, mainly prefrontal cortex dependent, neural
system for decision-making, forecasting the future consequences of a behavior,
and inhibitory control; and the insula that integrates interoception states into 
conscious feelings and into decision-making processes that are involved in
uncertain risk and reward. These systems account for poor decision-making (i.e.
prioritizing short-term consequences of a decisional option) leading to more
elevated addiction risk and relapse. This article provides neural evidence for
this three-systems neural model of addiction.

Using metabotropic glutamate receptors to modulate cocaine's synaptic and
behavioral effects: mGluR1 finds a niche.

Loweth JA(1), Tseng KY, Wolf ME.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine, USA.

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are important modulators of
excitatory synaptic transmission and therefore potential targets for drug
development. In several brain regions (ventral tegmental area (VTA), cerebellum, 
and amygdala), stimulation of mGluR1 selectively inhibits synaptic transmission
mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and thus produces
synaptic depression. The same relationship has now been demonstrated in the
nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that is critical for cocaine craving. CP-AMPAR 
levels in NAc synapses are normally low, but they increase after prolonged
withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration (SA). These CP-AMPARs
mediate the intensified ('incubated') cue-induced cocaine craving observed under 
these conditions. Therefore, activation of mGluR1 with positive allosteric
modulators (PAM) may reduce cue-induced relapse in abstinent cocaine addicts.

Developments in psychiatry have ratified the existence of behavioral addictions, 
that certain activities such as gambling or video-game play may be considered
addictive in the absence of exogenous (i.e. drug-induced) stimulation of brain
reinforcement circuitry. This article describes recent advances in understanding 
the neurobiological basis of behavioral addiction, with a focus on pathological
gambling as the prototypical disorder. We describe positron emission tomography
(PET) studies characterizing dopaminergic transmission, and functional imaging
studies of reward processing and gambling-related cognitive distortions. The
current evidence not only indicates changes in pathological gamblers in core
circuitry implicated in drug addiction, but also highlights some subtle
differences. Behavioral addictions can also provide experimental traction on
distinguishing vulnerability markers for addictions from the active detrimental
effects of chronic drug use.

Exposure to addictive drugs can result in maladaptive alterations in neural
circuit function. This review highlights recent progress made in identifying the 
organization, function, and cellular plasticity of the ventral tegmental area
(VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), two brain regions strongly implicated in
substance use disorders. Emphasis is given to advances made with new research
methodologies, particularly optogenetics, which have provided scientists with an 
unprecedented ability to map neural circuitry and pinpoint drug-induced synaptic 
modifications. A better understanding of these adaptive events will aid the
development of pharmacological treatments for drug addiction and, more generally,
further our understanding of motivated behaviors.

Epigenetic regulation can mediate long-lasting changes in gene expression, which 
makes it an attractive mechanism for the stable behavioral abnormalities that
characterize drug addiction. Recent research has unveiled numerous types of
epigenetic modifications within the brain's reward circuitry in animal models of 
drug addiction. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the field,
focusing on histone modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs. We also
highlight several areas for future research. Unraveling the highly complex
epigenetic mechanisms of addiction is adding to our understanding of this
syndrome and has the potential to trigger novel approaches for better diagnosis
and therapy.

Drug craving and relapse to drug use during abstinence are defining features of
addiction. Evidence indicates that drug craving and relapse in humans are often
provoked by acute exposure to the self-administered drug, drug-associated cues,
or stress. During the last two decades, this clinical scenario has been primarily
studied at the preclinical level using the classical reinstatement model.
However, a single preclinical model cannot capture the complicated nature of
human drug relapse. Therefore, more recently, we and others have developed
several other models to study different facets of human drug relapse. In this
review, we introduce and discuss recent findings from these other relapse models,
including incubation of drug craving, reacquisition and resurgence models, and
punishment-based and conflict-based relapse models.

Drink, drugs and disruption: memory manipulation for the treatment of addiction.

Addiction is a complex disorder, and one characterised by the acquisition of
maladaptive instrumental (drug-seeking and drug-taking) and pavlovian (cue-drug
associations) memories. These memories markedly contribute to the long-term risk 
of relapse, so reduction of the impact of these memories on behaviour could
potentially be an important addition to current therapies for addiction. Memory
reconsolidation may provide such a target for disrupting well-consolidated
pavlovian cue-drug memories following an extensive drug history. Reconsolidation 
can be disrupted either by administering amnestic drugs in conjunction with a
memory reactivation session, or by updating the memory adaptively through the
induction of 'superextinction'. More work is needed before these therapies are
ready for translation to the clinic, but if found clinically effective memory
manipulation promises a radical new way of treating addiction.

All sexually reproducing animals exhibit gender differences in behavior. Such
sexual dimorphisms in behavior are most obvious in stereotyped displays that
enhance reproductive success such as mating, aggression, and parental care.
Sexually dimorphic behaviors are a consequence of a sexually differentiated
nervous system, and recent studies in fruit flies and mice reveal novel insights 
into the neural mechanisms that control these behaviors. In the main, these
include a diverse array of novel sex differences in the nervous system,
surprisingly modular control of various stereotyped dimorphic behavioral
routines, and unanticipated sensory and central modulation of mating. We start
with a brief overview to provide the appropriate conceptual framework so that the
advances made by the newer studies discussed subsequently can be fully
appreciated. We restrict our review to reporting progress in understanding the
basis of mating and aggression in fruit flies and mice.

How does an organism's internal state direct its actions? At one moment an animal
forages for food with acrobatic feats such as tree climbing and jumping between
branches. At another time, it travels along the ground to find water or a mate,
exposing itself to predators along the way. These behaviors are costly in terms
of energy or physical risk, and the likelihood of performing one set of actions
relative to another is strongly modulated by internal state. For example, an
animal in energy deficit searches for food and a dehydrated animal looks for
water. The crosstalk between physiological state and motivational processes
influences behavioral intensity and intent, but the underlying neural circuits
are poorly understood. Molecular genetics along with optogenetic and
pharmacogenetic tools for perturbing neuron function have enabled cell
type-selective dissection of circuits that mediate behavioral responses to
physiological state changes. Here, we review recent progress into neural circuit 
analysis of hunger in the mouse by focusing on a starvation-sensitive neuron
population in the hypothalamus that is sufficient to promote voracious eating. We
also consider research into the motivational processes that are thought to
underlie hunger in order to outline considerations for bridging the gap between
homeostatic and motivational neural circuits.

Optogenetic tools have revolutionized the field of neuroscience, and brought the 
study of neural circuits to a higher level. Optogenetics has significantly
improved our understanding not only of the neuronal connections and function of
the healthy brain, but also of the neuronal changes that lead to psychiatric
disorders. In this review, we summarize recent optogenetic studies that explored 
different brain circuits involved in natural behaviors, such as sleep and
arousal, reward, fear, and social and aggressive behavior. In addition, we
describe how alterations in these circuits may lead to psychiatric disorders such
as addiction, anxiety, depression, or schizophrenia.

Human attitudes and preferences are susceptible to social influence. Recent
social neuroscience studies, using theories and experimental paradigms from
social psychology, have begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying how
others influence our attitudes through processes such as social conformity,
cognitive inconsistency and persuasion. The currently available evidence
highlights the role of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in social
conformity and cognitive inconsistency, which represents the discrepancy between 
one's own and another person's opinion, or, more broadly, between currently
inconsistent and ideally consistent states. Research on persuasion has revealed
that people's susceptibility to persuasive messages is related to activation in a
nearby but more anterior part of the medial frontal cortex. Future progress in
this field will depend upon the ability of researchers to dissociate underlying
motivations for attitude change in different paradigms, and to utilize
neuroimaging methods to advance social psychological theories of social
influence.

Aggression is a highly plastic behaviour, shaped by numerous experiences, and
potential costs and benefits of competing, to optimize fitness and survival.
Recent studies on crickets provide insights into how nervous systems achieve
this. Their fighting behaviour is promoted by physical exertion, winning disputes
and possession of resources. These effects are each mediated by octopamine, the
invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline. Submissive behaviour, in less well
understood. It is induced when the accumulated sum of the opponent's agonistic
signals surpass some critical level, and probably mediated by nitric oxide,
serotonin and other neuromodulators. We propose that animals can make the
decision to fight or flee by modulating the respective behavioural thresholds in 
response to potentially rewarding and aversive attributes of experiences.

Insights from the application of computational neuroimaging to social
neuroscience.

Dunne S(1), O'Doherty JP.

Author information: 
(1)California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.

A recent approach in social neuroscience has been the application of formal
computational models for a particular social-cognitive process to neuroimaging
data. Here we review preliminary findings from this nascent subfield, focusing on
observational learning and strategic interactions. We present evidence consistent
with the existence of three distinct learning systems that may contribute to
social cognition: an observational-reward-learning system involved in updating
expectations of future reward based on observing rewards obtained by others, an
action-observational learning system involved in learning about the action
tendencies of others, and a third system engaged when it is necessary to learn
about the hidden mental-states or traits of another. These three systems appear
to map onto distinct neuroanatomical substrates, and depend on unique
computational signals.

Neuroscience, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. stowers@scripps.edu

Aggression and fear are often thought to be distinct behavioral states, yet they 
share several common output responses. In the mouse, both can be initiated by
specialized odor cues. How these cues signal through the olfactory system to
promote behavior is largely unknown. Recent experiments have started to uncover
the relevant signaling ligands, chemosensory receptors, and responsive sensory
neurons that together enable the precise manipulation of behaviorally relevant
neural circuits. Moreover, the use of molecular genetics and new experimental
strategies has begun to reveal how the central nervous system processes olfactory
information to initiate aggression and fear. A sensory-initiated comparative
study of these two fundamental threat reactions promises to offer new mechanistic
insight.

Evolution of the brain and social behavior in chimpanzees.

The comparison of humans and chimpanzees is a unique way to highlight the
evolutionary origins of human nature. This paper summarizes the most recent
advances in the study of chimpanzee brains, cognition, and behavior. It covers
the topics such as eye-tracking study, helping behavior, prefrontal WM volume
increase during infancy, and fetal brain development. Based on the facts, the
paper proposed the "social brain hypothesis". Chimpanzees are good at capturing
images as a whole, while humans are better at understanding the meaning of what
they see. Chimpanzees apparently focus on the salient objects, neglecting the
social context. In contrast, humans always recognize things within the social
context, paying preferential attention to people, as agents. This is consistent
with the fact that humans are highly altruistic and collaborative from a very
young age. Thus, humans have evolved towards increased collaboration and mutual
support. This kind of evolutionary pressure may have provided the basis for the
development of the human brain with its unique functions.

Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.

Fear and anxiety are debilitating conditions that affect a significant number of 
individuals in their lifetimes. Understanding underlying mechanisms of these
disorders affords us the possibility of therapeutic intervention. Such clarity in
terms of mechanism and intervention can only come from an amalgamation of
research from human to animal studies that attempt to mimic the human condition, 
both of which are discussed in this review. We begin by presenting an outline of 
our current understanding of the neurobiological basis of fear and anxiety. This 
outline spans various levels of organization that include the circuitry,
molecular pathways, genetic and epigenetic components of fear and anxiety. Using 
these organizational levels as a scaffold, we then discuss strategies that are
currently used to ameliorate these disorders, and forecast future interventions
that hold therapeutic promise. Among these newer promising treatments, we
include, optogenetic, pharmacological, and extinction-based approaches, as well
as lifestyle modifications, with combinatorial treatment regimens of these
holding the most promise.

Social ties and health: a social neuroscience perspective.

Research over the last several decades has shown that the health of the body is
intimately tied to the strength of our social connections, but why? This article 
reviews evidence from affective and social neuroscience suggesting that, because 
of the importance of social ties for mammalian survival, threats to social
connection are processed by some of the same neural regions that process basic
threats to survival and consequently trigger physiological threat responses that 
have negative health implications. Likewise, social support is processed by some 
of the same neural regions that process safety or protection from basic threats
and inhibit these same health-relevant physiological threat responses.

Classical experiments have demonstrated that the amygdala facilitates synaptic
plasticity in other brain structures (e.g. hippocampus, basal ganglia) believed
to constitute the storage sites for various types of memory. Here, we summarize
new developments in our understanding of how the amygdala facilitates the
formation of emotional memories. Recent insights into this question have come
from studies relying on simultaneous recording of neurons in multiple brain
regions during learning. This approach has revealed that in emotionally arousing 
conditions, whether positively or negatively valenced, the amygdala allows
incoming information to be processed more efficiently in distributed cerebral
networks. This review also highlights the need to understand how different brain 
regions act in parallel to efficiently achieve one goal.

Reinforcement signalling in Drosophila; dopamine does it all after all.

Building, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3SR, UK. scott.waddell@cncb.ox.ac.uk

Reinforcement systems are believed to drive synaptic plasticity within neural
circuits that store memories. Recent evidence from the fruit fly suggests that
anatomically distinct dopaminergic neurons ultimately provide the key instructive
signals for both appetitive and aversive learning. This dual role for dopamine
overturns the previous model that octopamine signalled reward and dopamine
punishment. More importantly, this anatomically segregated double role for
dopamine in reward and aversion mirrors that emerging in mammals. Therefore, an
antagonistic organization of distinct reinforcing dopaminegic neurons is a
conserved feature of brains. It now seems crucial to understand how the
dopaminergic neurons are controlled and what the released dopamine does to the
underlying circuits to convey opposite valence.

Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) refers to face recognition deficits in the
absence of brain damage. DP affects ∼2% of the population, and it often runs in
families. DP studies have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive
and neural characteristics of the disorder. A key challenge is to develop a valid
taxonomy of DP that will facilitate many aspects of research.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is an ancient signaling molecule that has a
conserved role in modulating mood and behavior. Integral to its pleiotropic
actions is the existence of multiple receptors, expressed in distinct but often
overlapping patterns within the brain and the periphery. The existence of ∼14
mammalian receptor subtypes, many of which possess similar pharmacological
profiles, has made assigning functional roles for these receptors challenging.
This challenge has been further compounded by the revelation that a single
receptor can have several different functions depending upon where and when it is
expressed and activated, that is, in brain versus periphery, or at different
developmental time points. This review highlights the contribution of genetic
techniques to dissect the specific function of distinct serotonin receptor
populations across the life course, with an emphasis on the contribution of
different serotonin 1A receptor populations to mood and behavior. Similar
approaches hold the promise to elucidate the functional roles of other receptors,
as well as the interaction of serotonin with other neuroendocrine modulators of
mood and behavior.

Neuroscience of affect: brain mechanisms of pleasure and displeasure.

Affective neuroscience aims to understand how affect (pleasure or displeasure) is
created by brains. Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both
objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective
reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on
their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for
neural representation of pleasure in the brain (gained largely from neuroimaging 
studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (gained largely from
brain manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may
actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation 
reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal 
cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core
pleasure or 'liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes
surprisingly localized. Pleasure 'liking' is especially generated by restricted
hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another
example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective
keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either
positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread.

Ethotransmission: communication of emotional states through ultrasonic
vocalization in rats.

Brudzynski SM(1).

Canada. sbrudzyn@brocku.ca

Adult rats emit two categories of ultrasonic vocalizations, 22 kHz calls and 50
kHz calls. These vocalizations communicate animal's emotional state to other
members of the social group. Production of social vocalizations is an
evolutionary old activity in vertebrates, and is regulated by well-preserved
brain circuitries. The 22 kHz calls express negative, aversive state and are
initiated by activity of the mesolimbic cholinergic system originating from
laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. The 50 kHz calls express positive, appetitive
state and are initiated by activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system
originating from the ventral tegmental area. The 22 kHz calls serve as warning
and alarm calls, while the 50 kHz calls serve as affiliative and
social-cooperating calls. These specie-specific vocalizations play role of
ethological transmitters, termed ethotransmitters, that is, they are
species-specific signals that are selectively recognized by receivers and have
capability of changing emotional state of the receivers.

Emotions: form follows function.

Farb NA(1), Chapman HA, Anderson AK.

Author information: 
(1)Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, Canada. nfarb@research.baycrest.org

Emotion research has been divided by debate as to whether emotions are universal 
in form or cognitively constructed. We review an emerging approach that focuses
on function rather than form. Functional affective science suggests that the
particular origin of an emotion is relatively unimportant; instead, emotions can 
be understood in terms of a rapidly deployed set of mechanisms that structure
perception, cognition and behavior to facilitate goal fulfillment. Evidence from 
this approach suggests at least three major functions of emotion: sensory gating,
embodying affect, and integrating knowledge toward goal resolution. These
functions appear to be universal and automatically activated, yet also moderated 
by conscious representation and regulatory efforts.

Understanding how a human brain creates a human mind ultimately depends on
mapping psychological categories and concepts to physical measurements of neural 
response. Although it has long been assumed that emotional, social, and cognitive
phenomena are realized in the operations of separate brain regions or brain
networks, we demonstrate that it is possible to understand the body of
neuroimaging evidence using a framework that relies on domain general,
distributed structure-function mappings. We review current research in affective 
and social neuroscience and argue that the emerging science of large-scale
intrinsic brain networks provides a coherent framework for a domain-general
functional architecture of the human brain.

Social judgments from faces.

Todorov A(1), Mende-Siedlecki P, Dotsch R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychology, Princeton University, USA. atodorov@princeton.edu

People make rapid and consequential social judgments from minimal (non-emotional)
facial cues. There has been rapid progress in identifying the perceptual basis of
these judgments using data-driven, computational models. In contrast, our
understanding of the neural underpinnings of these judgments is rather limited.
Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies find a wide range of seemingly inconsistent
responses in the amygdala that co-vary with social judgments from faces. Guided
by computational models of social judgments, these responses can be accounted by 
positing that the amygdala (and posterior face selective regions) tracks face
typicality. Atypical faces, whether positively or negatively evaluated, elicit
stronger responses in the amygdala. We conclude with the promise of data-driven
methods for modeling neural responses to social judgments from faces.

Williams syndrome (WS) offers an exciting model for social neuroscience because
its genetic basis is well-defined, and the unique phenotype reflects dimensions
of prosocial behaviors. WS is associated with a strong drive to approach
strangers, a gregarious personality, heightened social engagement yet difficult
peer interactions, high nonsocial anxiety, unusual bias toward positive affect,
and diminished sensitivity to fear. New neurobiological evidence points toward
alterations in structure, function, and connectivity of the social brain
(amygdala, fusiform face area, orbital-frontal regions). Recent genetic studies
implicate gene networks in the WS region with the dysregulation of prosocial
neuropeptides. The study of WS has implications for understanding human social
development, and may provide insight for translating genetic and neuroendocrine
evidence into treatments for disorders of social behavior.

The lesion method provides unique insight into how the human brain generates
emotion and feeling. Recent work has explored a number of interesting topics
including the dissociation of emotional experience from memory in patients with
amnesia, the reliability of specific emotional deficits following focal brain
damage (including fear and the amygdala), and the investigation of compensatory
neural mechanisms in lesion patients. Several detailed case studies have
challenged the necessary role of the insular cortex in both awareness and feeling
by showing that even in rare instances of complete bilateral insula destruction, 
the patient remains fully sentient and capable of expressing and feeling emotion.
These findings highlight the distributed nature of emotion processing in the
human brain and emphasize the importance of utilizing the lesion method for
elucidating brain-behavior relationships.

Discussions of the neural underpinnings of social cognition frequently emphasize 
the distinctiveness of human social cognition. Here, however, we review the
discovery of similar correlations between neural networks and social networks in 
humans and other primates. We suggest that component parts of these neural
networks in dorsal frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and superior 
temporal sulcus (STS) are linked to basic social cognitive processes common to
several primate species including monitoring the actions of others, assigning
importance to others, and orienting behavior toward or away from others. Changes 
in activity in other brain regions occur in tandem with changes in social status 
and may be related to the different types of behaviors associated with variation 
in social status.

Humans are highly sensitive to another's gaze direction, and use this information
to support a range of social cognitive functions. Here we review recent studies
that have begun to delineate a neural system for gaze perception. We focus in
particular on a set of core gaze processes: perceptual coding of another's eye
gaze direction, which may involve anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS);
gaze-cued attentional orienting, which may be mediated by lateral parietal
regions; and the experience of joint attention with another individual, which
recruits medial prefrontal cortex. We conclude that understanding this gaze
processing system will require a combination of multivariate pattern analysis
approaches to characterise the role of individual nodes as well as
connectivity-based methods to study interactions at the systems level.

The visual cortical network consists of a number of specialized areas that are
connected in a highly structured way. Understanding the function of this network 
is a milestone goal of visual neuroscience. This goal is pursued at different
levels of description, including large-scale neuroanatomical as well as molecular
and cellular perspectives. As a consequence, visual cortical networks are studied
with a diverse set of methods across the order of mammalian species, ranging from
the human all the way down to the mouse. Remarkable progress has been made at
both ends of the spectrum. On the basis of work in humans, the last decade has
seen ongoing refinements of the intricate functional organization of the cortical
visual network. Neuroimaging studies have opened up the possibility to map
individual visual areas, characterize their function and, search for an
overarching organizational principle. Meanwhile, the mouse has become a valuable 
model system for early visual processing. A number of studies have demonstrated
that basic response properties observed in higher-order mammals are also present 
in the mouse, making it possible to apply genetic tools to study visual network
function. Here, we discuss the progress in these two fields side-by-side. We
summarize new findings that have shaped our current understanding of the human
cortical network. In addition, we review recent work that has laid the foundation
for a mouse model of visual cortical processing. Although their brains are
different, the visual cortical networks of mice and men share structural and
functional principles.

Network interactions: non-geniculate input to V1.

The strongest connections to V1 are fed back from neighbouring area V2 and from a
network of higher cortical areas (e.g. V3, V5, LOC, IPS and A1), transmitting the
results of cognitive operations such as prediction, attention and imagination. V1
is therefore at the receiving end of a complex cortical processing cascade and
not only at the entrance stage of cortical processing of retinal input. One
elegant strategy to investigate this information-rich feedback to V1 is to
eliminate feedforward input, that is, exploit V1's retinotopic organisation to
isolate subregions receiving no direct bottom-up stimulation. We highlight the
diverse mechanisms of cortical feedback, ranging from gain control to predictive 
coding, and conclude that V1 is involved in rich internal communication
processes.

GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
adult brain. Studies on GABAergic cells have focused almost exclusively on local 
interneurons neglecting those inhibitory neurons projecting to different brain
areas, the 'long-range GABAergic cells'. This review focuses on some common
features and peculiarities of 'corticofugal' and 'corticopetal' GABAergic cells. 
Similarly to their local counterpart, long-range GABAergic cells show
immunohistochemical diversity and contact locally both excitatory and inhibitory 
cells. Distally, long-range GABAergic cells often target other inhibitory
neurons. This feature endows them with the ability to control remote target areas
via disinhibition. On the basis of few functional studies that investigated their
participation in synchronous network activity, we propose that long-range
GABAergic neurons play a critical role in the temporal coordination of neuronal
activity in distant brain areas.

A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is how the human brain
self-organizes to perform tasks. Multiple accounts of this self-organization are 
currently influential and in this article we survey one of these accounts. We
begin by introducing a psychological model of task control and several
neuroimaging signals it predicts. We then discuss where such signals are found
across tasks with emphasis on brain regions where multiple control signals are
present. We then present results derived from spontaneous task-free functional
connectivity between control-related regions that dovetail with distinctions made
by control signals present in these regions, leading to a proposal that there are
at least two task control systems in the brain. This prompts consideration of
whether and how such control systems distinguish themselves from other brain
regions in a whole-brain context. We present evidence from whole-brain networks
that such distinctions do occur and that control systems comprise some of the
basic system-level organizational elements of the human brain. We close with
observations from the whole-brain networks that may suggest parsimony between
multiple accounts of cognitive control.

Our understanding of cortical electrophysiology and anatomy at the single-cell
level has led to the present day insight in to the function of connections
linking cortical areas. This made it possible to elaborate the cortical hierarchy
in the early 1990s and was a prerequisite for the development of present day
generative models of perception. These computational hierarchical models make
strong predictions concerning the roles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB)
pathways, including their segregation and topographical precision in both
directions. This shows that instead of a single stream in the upper and lower
compartments of the cortex there is in fact a bi-directional counter-stream in
each compartment of the cortex. A significant advance in this field will require 
more detailed anatomy hand in hand with a network analysis of the directed and
weighted cortical matrix.

Human neuroimaging is expanding our understanding of the biological processes
that are essential for healthy brain function. Methods such as diffusion weighted
imaging provide insights into white matter fascicles, growth and pruning of
dendritic arbors and axons, and properties of glia. This review focuses on what
we have learned from diffusion imaging about these processes and the development 
of reading circuitry in the human brain. Understanding reading circuitry
development may suggest ways to improve how we teach children to read.

Central to macro-connectomics and much of systems neuroscience is the idea that
we can summarise macroscopic brain connectivity using a network of 'nodes' and
'edges'--functionally distinct brain regions and the connections between them.
This is an approach that allows a deep understanding of brain dynamics and how
they relate to brain circuitry. This approach, however, ignores key features of
anatomical connections, such as spatial arrangement and topographic mappings. In 
this article, we suggest an alternative to this paradigm. We propose that
connection topographies can inform us about brain networks in ways that are
complementary to the concepts of 'nodes' and 'edges'. We also show that current
neuroimaging technology is capable of revealing details of connection
topographies in vivo. These advances, we hope, will allow us to explore brain
connectivity in novel ways in the immediate future.

Network studies of large-scale brain connectivity have begun to reveal attributes
that promote the segregation and integration of neural information: communities
and hubs. Network communities are sets of regions that are strongly
interconnected among each other while connections between members of different
communities are less dense. The clustered connectivity of network communities
supports functional segregation and specialization. Network hubs link communities
to one another and ensure efficient communication and information integration.
This review surveys a number of recent reports on network communities and hubs,
and their role in integrative processes. An emerging focus is the shifting
balance between segregation and integration over time, which manifest in
continuously changing patterns of functional interactions between regions,
circuits and systems.

A major challenge in systems neuroscience is to unravel the complex matrix of
connections that characterize functional circuits within the central nervous
system. Retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus has proven to be
especially useful for this purpose. Here we provide specific examples in which
transneuronal transport of rabies virus has been used to unravel multi-synaptic
pathways within motor, cognitive and autonomic circuits. Tracing with rabies
virus defined: first, the closed-loop organization of cerebellar and basal
ganglia circuits with the cerebral cortex; second, the presence of bidirectional 
communication between the cerebellum and basal ganglia; third, the specific
cortical areas that have monosynaptic and/or disynaptic connections to spinal
motoneurons in non-human primates; and fourth, the areas in the cerebral cortex
with the most direct influence on the sympathetic innervation of the kidney.
These examples demonstrate the power of transneuronal tracing with rabies virus
to identify the macroarchitecture of complex neural circuits.

Functional neuroimaging shows that patients with disorders of consciousness
exhibit disrupted system-level functional connectivity. Unresponsive/"vegetative 
state" patients preserve wakefulness networks of brainstem and basal forebrain
but the cerebral networks accounting for external perceptual awareness and
internal self-related mentation are disrupted. Specifically, the 'external
awareness' network encompassing lateral fronto-temporo-parietal cortices
bilaterally, and the 'internal awareness' network including midline anterior
cingulate/mesiofrontal and posterior cingulate/precuneal cortices, are
functionally disconnected. By contrast, patients in minimally conscious state
'minus', who show non-reflex behaviors, are characterized by right-lateralized
recovery of the external awareness network. Similarly, patients who evolve to
minimally conscious state 'plus' and respond to commands recover the dominant
left-lateralized language network. Now, the use of active experimental paradigms 
targeting at detecting motor-independent signs of awareness or even establishing 
communication with these patients, challenge these two clinical boundaries. Such 
advances are naturally accompanied by legitimate neuroscientific and ethical
queries demanding our attention on the medical implementations of this new
knowledge.

Recent work has advanced our knowledge of phasic dopamine reward prediction error
signals. The error signal is bidirectional, reflects well the higher order
prediction error described by temporal difference learning models, is compatible 
with model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, reports the subjective
rather than physical reward value during temporal discounting and reflects
subjective stimulus perception rather than physical stimulus aspects. Dopamine
activations are primarily driven by reward, and to some extent risk, whereas
punishment and salience have only limited activating effects when appropriate
controls are respected. The signal is homogeneous in terms of time course but
heterogeneous in many other aspects. It is essential for synaptic plasticity and 
a range of behavioural learning situations.

This review considers state-of-the-art analyses of functional integration in
neuronal macrocircuits. We focus on detecting and estimating directed
connectivity in neuronal networks using Granger causality (GC) and dynamic causal
modelling (DCM). These approaches are considered in the context of functional
segregation and integration and--within functional integration--the distinction
between functional and effective connectivity. We review recent developments that
have enjoyed a rapid uptake in the discovery and quantification of functional
brain architectures. GC and DCM have distinct and complementary ambitions that
are usefully considered in relation to the detection of functional connectivity
and the identification of models of effective connectivity. We highlight the
basic ideas upon which they are grounded, provide a comparative evaluation and
point to some outstanding issues.

How are some thoughts favored over others? A wealth of data at the level of
single neurons has yielded candidate brain areas and mechanisms for our
best-understood model: visual attention. Recent work has naturally evolved toward
efforts at a more integrative, network, understanding. It suggests that focusing 
attention arises from interactions between widespread cortical and subcortical
networks that may be regulated via their rhythmic synchronization.

Dysconnectivity, large-scale networks and neuronal dynamics in schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia remains a daunting challenge for efforts aimed at identifying
fundamental pathophysiological processes and to develop evidence-based effective 
treatments and interventions. One reason for the lack of progress lies in the
fact that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been predominantly conceived
in terms of circumscribed alterations in cellular and anatomical variables. In
the current review, it is proposed that this approach needs to be complemented by
a focus on the neuronal dynamics in large-scale networks which is compatible with
the notion of dysconnectivity, highlighting the involvement of both reduced and
increased interactions in extended cortical circuits in schizophrenia. Neural
synchrony is one candidate mechanisms for achieving functional connectivity in
large-scale networks and has been found to be impaired in schizophrenia.
Importantly, alterations in the synchronization of neural oscillations can be
related to dysfunctions in the excitation-inhibition (E/I)-balance and
developmental modifications with important implications for translational
research.

Empathy circuits.

and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany.

The social neuroscientific investigation of empathy has revealed that the same
neural networks engaged during first-hand experience of affect subserve empathic 
responses. Recent meta-analyses focusing on empathy for pain for example reliably
identified a network comprising anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex.
Moreover, recent studies suggest that the generation of empathy is flexibly
supported by networks involved in action simulation and mentalizing depending on 
the information available in the environment. Further, empathic responses are
modulated by many factors including the context they occur in. Recent work shows 
how this modulation can be afforded by the engagement of antagonistic
motivational systems or by cognitive control circuits, and these modulatory
systems can also be employed in efforts to regulate one's empathic responses.

The importance of the medial temporal lobe to episodic memory has been recognized
for decades. Recent human fMRI findings have begun to delineate the functional
roles of different MTL regions, most notably the hippocampus, for the retrieval
of episodic memories. Importantly, these studies have also identified a network
of cortical regions--each interconnected with the MTL--that are also consistently
engaged during successful episodic retrieval. Along with the MTL these regions
appear to constitute a content-independent network that acts in concert with
cortical regions representing the contents of retrieval to support consciously
accessible representations of prior experiences.

Language processing is supported by different regions located in separate parts
of the brain. A crucial condition for these regions to function as a network is
the information transfer between them. This is guaranteed by dorsal and ventral
pathways connecting prefrontal and temporal language-relevant regions. Based on
functional brain imaging studies, these pathways' language functions can be
assigned indirectly. Dorsally, one pathway connecting the temporal cortex (TC)
and premotor cortex supports speech repetition, another one connecting the TC and
posterior Broca's area supports complex syntactic processes. Ventrally, the
uncinate fascile and the inferior fronto-occipital fascile subserve semantic and 
basic syntactic processes. Thus, the available evidence points towards a neural
language network with at least two dorsal and two ventral pathways.

Optogenetic tools can be used to manipulate neuronal activity in a reversible and
specific manner. In recent years, such methods have been applied to uncover
causal relationships between activity in specified neuronal circuits and behavior
in the larval zebrafish. In this small, transparent, genetic model organism,
noninvasive manipulation and monitoring of neuronal activity with light is
possible throughout the nervous system. Here we review recent work in which these
new tools have been applied to zebrafish, and discuss some of the existing
challenges of these approaches.

Researchers are beginning to uncover the neurogenetic pathways that underlie our 
unparalleled capacity for spoken language. Initial clues come from identification
of genetic risk factors implicated in developmental language disorders. The
underlying genetic architecture is complex, involving a range of molecular
mechanisms. For example, rare protein-coding mutations of the FOXP2 transcription
factor cause severe problems with sequencing of speech sounds, while common
genetic risk variants of small effect size in genes like CNTNAP2, ATP2C2 and CMIP
are associated with typical forms of language impairment. In this article, we
describe how investigations of these and other candidate genes, in humans,
animals and cellular models, are unravelling the connections between genes and
cognition. This depends on interdisciplinary research at multiple levels, from
determining molecular interactions and functional roles in neural cell-biology
all the way through to effects on brain structure and activity.

Pain is a complex consciousness that emerges from the brain, and is commonly a
result of nociception; the physiological process initiated by activation of
specialised high-threshold peripheral sensory neurons. When pain is persistent,
its affective aspects can dominate and cause considerable suffering. This chronic
pain state is not an inevitable consequence of physical injury or disease.
Instead, susceptibility to chronic pain results from complex interactions between
multiple genes and the environment that influence nociception and regulate the
consciousness of pain. The biological bases for chronic pain can now be defined
and measured by brain neuroimaging at a systems level, where penetrance of
genetic variation should be higher when compared to syndromal phenotypes. To
date, very few neuroimaging studies have attempted to connect brain activity
associated with pain to genes. We review these together with other pertinent
studies here, and suggest how neuroimaging endophenotypes might prove useful for 
the development of treatments for chronic pain.

Mitochondrial quality control turns out to be the principal suspect in parkin and
PINK1-related autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been suspected to play a key role in
neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 and Parkin, the products of two
genes responsible for autosomal recessive Parkinsonian syndromes with early
onset, act as a quality control system on the outer mitochondrial membrane to
preserve mitochondrial integrity. While doing so, they interact with multiple
molecular actors in processes regulating mitochondrial biology and cell survival.
The physiological conditions that mobilize these processes in neurons, and the
mechanisms underlying their integration and spatiotemporal coordination, remain
to be elucidated. Understanding how dysfunction of these house-keeping pathways
leads to the preferential degeneration of a specific neuronal population in
Parkinson's disease is a major challenge for future research.

Songbirds are a productive model organism to study the neural basis of
auditory-guided vocal motor learning. Like human babies, juvenile songbirds learn
many of their vocalizations by imitating an adult conspecific. This process is a 
product of genetic predispositions and the individual's life experience and has
been investigated mainly by neuroanatomical, physiological and behavioral
methods. Results have revealed general principles governing vertebrate motor
behavior, sensitive periods, sexual dimorphism, social behavior regulation and
adult neurogenesis. More recently, the emerging field of birdsong neurogenetics
has advanced the way we think about genetic contributions to communication,
mechanistically and conceptually.

From an information processing perspective, memories need to be acquired,
encoded, stored, maintained and retrieved. As time passes after training,
memories become less easily retrieved, but also become progressively more stable 
in the face of experimental perturbations. This process is referred to as
consolidation. But the term has been used to describe two different biological
processes whose relationship is poorly understood [1,2]. The first, which we
refer to as biochemical consolidation, involves cell-signaling events within a
neuron. The second, which we call systems consolidation, involves ongoing
communication between brain regions or cell types. Although systems consolidation
was first thought to be at play only in complex brains, a number of recent
studies reveal its importance in Drosophila. The ease of cell type specific
genetic manipulations in flies provides a unique opportunity to forge an
integrated mechanistic understanding of biochemical and systems consolidation.

Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits behavior plasticity that appears to correspond to
non-associative and associative learning, and short-term and long-term memory.
Recent finding revealed that evolutionally conserved molecules such as insulin,
monoamines, and neuropeptides are required for the plasticity. We propose the
concept of human brain operation from the C. elegans studies.

The neuropeptide oxytocin has had key roles throughout mammalian evolution in the
regulation of complex social cognition and behaviors, such as attachment,
parental care, pair-bonding, as well as social exploration and recognition.
Recently, studies have begun to provide evidence that the function of this
neuropeptide is impaired in mental disorders associated with social deficits. In 
this review, we focus on the genetic mechanisms of inter-individual variation in 
the social neuropeptide signaling. We discuss molecular genetic studies which
identified variations in specific genes contributing to individual differences in
social behavior and cognition, with a focus on the gene coding for the oxytocin
receptor (OXTR) emerging as a particularly promising candidate. We conclude that 
molecular studies are warranted to elucidate functional consequences of variants 
that have shown stable associations with sociobehavioral phenotypes. With regard 
to the variability in individual responses to oxytocin administration, we
advocate the need for pharmacogenetic approaches in order to test how the
efficacy of oxytocin administration is modulated by genetic variation of OXTR or 
other genes involved in oxytocin signaling.

The construction of a comprehensive structural, and importantly functional map of
the network of elements and connections forming the brain represents the Holy
Grail for research groups working in disparate disciplines. Although technical
limitations have restricted the mapping of human and mouse 'connectomes' to the
level of brain regions, a finer degree of functional resolution is attainable in 
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, due to the armamentarium of genetic tools
available for this model organism. Currently, one of the most amenable approaches
employed by Drosophila neurobiologists involves mapping neuronal circuitry
underlying complex innate behaviors - courtship being a classic paradigm. We
discuss recent studies aimed at identifying the cellular components of courtship 
neural circuits, mapping function in these circuits and defining causal
relationships between neural activity and behavior.

Learning is widespread in the animal kingdom. From the small nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, learning appears to play a central role in
adaptation to local spatial and temporal environmental conditions. Though the
neurobiological mechanisms of learning and memory have been intensively studied, 
the function and adaptive significance of learning has only recently received
interest. Using learning, animals may progressively adjust their behavior in
response to new environmental conditions, suggesting benefits of learning on
animal performance, at least in the short term. How does learning affect the
overall fitness of an animal? What are the fitness benefits and costs of
learning? How can we explain the natural variation in learning ability observed
between individuals, between populations of the same species or between closely
related species? What are the ecological circumstances that favor the evolution
of learning? There are all emerging questions that are central to a better
understanding of the evolution of cognition and animal adaptation. Here I review 
the recent evidence showing that learning and memory are molded by an animal's
lifestyle within its ecological niche.

The inability to discriminate friend from foe or the 'one' among many potential
mates can have immediate life-threatening consequences or a long-term
evolutionary impact. Successful social interactions depend on the ability to
recognize and identify individuals within a social context. Once recognition
occurs, a repertoire of behavioral responses becomes available and choices are
made as interactions between individuals unfold. The vinegar fly, Drosophila
melanogaster, displays a wide range of social activities and patterns of social
interaction. If a male fly is unable to recognize other males or distinguish them
from females, he may attempt to court both males and females alike, wasting
energy and reducing his fitness. We review recent studies on the mechanisms of
social recognition in this organism that pertain to both sides of an interaction:
the generation of signals by one individual and the receiving and processing of
these signals by others.

Elucidating the molecular and neural basis of complex social behaviors such as
communal living, division of labor and warfare requires model organisms that
exhibit these multi-faceted behavioral phenotypes. Social insects, such as ants, 
bees, wasps and termites, are attractive models to address this problem, with
rich ecological and ethological foundations. However, their atypical systems of
reproduction have hindered application of classical genetic approaches. In this
review, we discuss how recent advances in social insect genomics,
transcriptomics, and functional manipulations have enhanced our ability to
observe and perturb gene expression, physiology and behavior in these species.
Such developments begin to provide an integrated view of the molecular and
cellular underpinnings of complex social behavior.

Depression, conceptualized as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a complex
psychiatric disorder with multiple behavioral changes and alterations in various 
brain regions. Biochemically, serotonin and others substances like GABA,
glutamate, norepinephrin, adrenaline/noradrenaline play an essential role in the 
pathogenesis of MDD. The paper reviews recent human neuroimaging findings on how 
the genes underlying these biochemical substances modulate neural activity,
behavior, and ultimately clinical symptoms. Current data provide solid evidence
that genes related to serotonin impact emotion-related neural activity in the
amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, evidence is not as
strong for genes related to biochemical substances other than serotonin and other
regions of the brain. The review concludes with discussing future genetic,
neural, and clinical challenges that point out the central role of gene ×
environment and brain × environment interactions as genetic and neural
predispositions of depression.

Gene expression can be modulated in two opposite directions, towards higher or
lower amounts of product. How do diametric changes in gene dosage influence
neurological development and function? Recent studies of transgenic and knockout 
mouse models, genomic copy-number variants, imprinted-gene expression
alterations, and sex-chromosome aneuploidies are revealing examples of
'mirror-extreme' brain and behavior phenotypes, which provide unique insights
into neurodevelopmental architecture. These convergent studies quantitatively
connect gene dosages with specific trajectories and outcomes, with important
implications for the experimental dissection of normal neurological functions,
the genetic analysis of psychiatric disorders, the development of pharmacological
therapies, and mechanisms for the evolution of human brain and behavior.

Lateralization of motor control in the human nervous system: genetics of mirror
movements.

Peng J(1), Charron F.

Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada.

Mirror movements (MM) are a peculiar motor defect in humans where the intended
unilateral movement of a body part results in involuntary movement of the same
body part on the opposite side. This loss in the lateralization of motor control 
can be caused by genetic mutations that result in an aberrant projection of the
corticospinal tract. However, recent evidence suggests that the same genes
controlling corticospinal tract development also play roles in the development of
other circuits involved in motor control, including local spinal circuits and the
corpus callosum. These recent studies in humans and mouse models of MM will be
discussed to provide an overview of the basis of MM and the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the lateralization of motor control.

Behavior is flexible at different timescales, modifiable by experience in the
short term and by evolution in the long term. In order to understand how behavior
evolves, we must both understand how trait differences between individuals are
inherited and how a subset of these differences get fixed within a species'
lineage. Work over the past few decades has shown that this will not be easy; the
genetic basis of heritable behavioral differences between two individuals is
typically complex, caused by multiple genetic variants of small effect. Here I
describe how the underlying genetic networks impact the types of genetic variants
that can be selected for by evolution.

In contrast to physiology and morphology, our understanding of how behaviors
evolve is limited. This is a challenging task, as it involves the identification 
of both the underlying genetic basis and the resultant physiological changes that
lead to behavioral divergence. In this review, we focus on chemosensory systems, 
mostly in Drosophila, as they are one of the best-characterized components of the
nervous system in model organisms, and evolve rapidly between species. We examine
the hypothesis that changes at the level of chemosensory systems contribute to
the diversification of behaviors. In particular, we review recent progress in
understanding how genetic changes between species affect chemosensory systems and
translate into divergent behaviors. A major evolutionary trend is the rapid
diversification of the chemoreceptor repertoire among species. We focus mostly on
functional comparative studies involving model species, highlighting examples
where changes in chemoreceptor identity and expression are sufficient to provoke 
changes in neural circuit activity and thus behavior. We conclude that while we
are beginning to understand the role that the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
plays in behavioral evolution, how the central nervous system (CNS) evolves to
produce behavioral changes is largely unknown, and we advocate the need to expand
functional comparative studies to address these questions.

Understanding how unique signaling outputs are generated in neurons using a
limited set of intracellular signaling mechanisms has been a challenge. A
combination of genetics and cell imaging, with tools developed to measure
signaling outputs, has shown that the restricted presence of a signaling
attenuator visibly alters the axonal range of the output and can be correlated
with different behavioral outputs. Another question of interest is regarding the 
extent of genetic plasticity possible in the context of a single behavioral
change. Recent molecular and genetic studies support the presence of parallel
pathways that can compensate for the primary defect both at the level of
physiology and behavior.

In this review we discuss recent developments in psychiatric genetics: on the one
hand, studies using whole genome approaches (genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) and exome sequencing) are coming close to finding genes and molecular
variants that contribute to disease susceptibility; on the other candidate genes,
such as the serotonin transporter, continue to dominate in genetic studies of
brain imaging phenotypes and in protracted searches for gene by environment
interactions. These two areas intersect, in that new information about genetic
effects from whole genome approaches, should (but does not always) inform the
single locus analyses.

In this review, I briefly summarize current neurobiological studies of
decision-making that bear on two general themes. The first focuses on the nature 
of neural representation and dynamics in a decision circuit. Experimental and
computational results suggest that ramping-to-threshold in the temporal domain
and trajectory of population activity in the state space represent a duality of
perspectives on a decision process. Moreover, a decision circuit can display
several different dynamical regimes, such as the ramping mode and the jumping
mode with distinct defining properties. The second is concerned with the
relationship between biologically-based mechanistic models and normative-type
models. A fruitful interplay between experiments and these models at different
levels of abstraction have enabled investigators to pose increasingly refined
questions and gain new insights into the neural basis of decision-making. In
particular, recent work on multi-alternative decisions suggests that deviations
from rational models of choice behavior can be explained by established neural
mechanisms.

The ubiquity of model-based reinforcement learning.

The reward prediction error (RPE) theory of dopamine (DA) function has enjoyed
great success in the neuroscience of learning and decision-making. This theory is
derived from model-free reinforcement learning (RL), in which choices are made
simply on the basis of previously realized rewards. Recently, attention has
turned to correlates of more flexible, albeit computationally complex,
model-based methods in the brain. These methods are distinguished from model-free
learning by their evaluation of candidate actions using expected future outcomes 
according to a world model. Puzzlingly, signatures from these computations seem
to be pervasive in the very same regions previously thought to support model-free
learning. Here, we review recent behavioral and neural evidence about these two
systems, in attempt to reconcile their enigmatic cohabitation in the brain.

Conscious motor intention emerges in the inferior parietal lobule.

Willed actions are characterized by the subjective experience of 'conscious
intention'. During the last decade the neural bases of this experience have been 
widely investigated. Previous findings have suggested that conscious intention
emerges in the mesial precentral area (MPA) including the supplementary and
pre-supplementary motor area. However, this assumption was later challenged by
evidence indicating a key contribution of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in
this process. In this review we show that this second hypothesis is the most
plausible. We provide behavioral, clinical and electrophysiological evidence that
IPL, rather than MPA, mediates the early subjective experience of 'wanting to
move'. We argue that MPA generates a feeling of 'motor urge', near movement
onset, when the inhibitory control exerted on the low-level motor areas is
released. We propose that goal directed actions trigger two forms of motor
intention: the first, 'wanting to move' intention is under the control of the
inferior parietal regions and specifies a general goal to be reached before
movement planning; the second, the 'urge to move' intention, is controlled by
mesial precentral areas and signals the time when the planned movement is about
to start. The time locked activation of these two forms of intention is at the
basis of movement control.

A sizable body of evidence has shown that the brain computes several types of
value-related signals to guide decision making, such as stimulus values, outcome 
values, and prediction errors. A critical question for understanding
decision-making mechanisms is whether these value signals are computed using an
absolute or a normalized code. Under an absolute code, the neural response used
to represent the value of a given stimulus does not depend on what other values
might have been encountered. By contrast, under a normalized code, the neural
response associated with a given value depends on its relative position in the
distribution of values. This review provides a simple framework for thinking
about value normalization, and uses it to evaluate the existing experimental
evidence.

The brain constructs representations of objects and concepts based in sensory
information combined with experience. This mental process, that we call
perception, is the result of a chain of events consisting of phenomena such as
detection, memory, discrimination, categorization and decision-making. Although
the phenomenon of perception is not necessarily dependent on a given sensory
modality (e.g. visual perception, auditory, tactile), single sensory models are
indispensable for studying the neural mechanisms that generate it. The
somatosensory system is a suitable model for studying the manner in which
presentation of a single physical variable (e.g. vibration) triggers a perceptual
process. Here, we discuss some recent studies in the somatosensory system that in
our view, constitute a breakthrough to understanding decision making.

A neuroethological approach to decision-making considers the effect of
evolutionary pressures on neural circuits mediating choice. In this view,
decision systems are expected to enhance fitness with respect to the local
environment, and particularly efficient solutions to specific problems should be 
conserved, expanded, and repurposed to solve other problems. Here, we discuss
basic prerequisites for a variety of decision systems from this viewpoint. We
focus on two of the best-studied and most widely represented decision problems.
First, we examine patch leaving, a prototype of environmentally based switching
between action patterns. Second, we consider social information seeking, a
process resembling foraging with search costs. We argue that while the specific
neural solutions to these problems sometimes differ across species, both the
problems themselves and the algorithms instantiated by biological hardware are
repeated widely throughout nature. The behavioral and mathematical study of
ubiquitous decision processes like patch leaving and social information seeking
thus provides a powerful new approach to uncovering the fundamental design
structure of nervous systems.

Optimal binary perceptual decision making requires accumulation of evidence in
the form of a probability distribution that specifies the probability of the
choices being correct given the evidence so far. Reward rates can then be
maximized by stopping the accumulation when the confidence about either option
reaches a threshold. Behavioral and neuronal evidence suggests that humans and
animals follow such a probabilitistic decision strategy, although its neural
implementation has yet to be fully characterized. Here we show that that
diffusion decision models and attractor network models provide an approximation
to the optimal strategy only under certain circumstances. In particular, neither 
model type is sufficiently flexible to encode the reliability of both the
momentary and the accumulated evidence, which is a pre-requisite to accumulate
evidence of time-varying reliability. Probabilistic population codes, by
contrast, can encode these quantities and, as a consequence, have the potential
to implement the optimal strategy accurately.

How do humans make choices between different types of rewards? Economists have
long argued on theoretical grounds that humans typically make these choices as if
the values of the options they consider have been mapped to a single common scale
for comparison. Neuroimaging studies in humans have recently begun to suggest the
existence of a small group of specific brain sites that appear to encode the
subjective values of different types of rewards on a neural common scale, almost 
exactly as predicted by theory. We have conducted a meta analysis using data from
thirteen different functional magnetic resonance imaging studies published in
recent years and we show that the principle brain area associated with this
common representation is a subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The data available today suggest that this
common valuation path is a core system that participates in day-to-day decision
making suggesting both a neurobiological foundation for standard economic theory 
and a tool for measuring preferences neurobiologically. Perhaps even more
exciting is the possibility that our emerging understanding of the neural
mechanisms for valuation and choice may provide fundamental insights into
pathological choice behaviors like addiction, obesity and gambling.

The stop-signal task probes agents' ability to inhibit responding. A well-known
race model affords estimation of the duration of the inhibition process. This
powerful approach has yielded numerous insights into the neural circuitry
underlying response control, the specificity of inhibition across effectors and
response strategies, and executive processes such as performance monitoring.
Translational research between human and non-human primates has been particularly
useful in this venture. Continued progress with the stop-signal paradigm is
contingent upon appreciating the dynamics of entire cortical and subcortical
neural circuits and obtaining neurophysiological data from each node in the
circuit. Progress can also be anticipated on extensions of the race model to
account for selective stopping; we expect this will entail embedding behavioral
inhibition in the broader context of executive control.

Environmental stimuli guide value-based decision making, but can do so through
cognitive representation of outcomes or through general-incentive properties
attributed to the cues themselves. We assert that these differences are conferred
through the use of alternative associative structures differing in computational 
intensity. Using this framework, we review scientific evidence to discern the
neural substrates of these assumed separable processes. We suggest that the
contribution of the mesolimbic dopamine system to Pavlovian valuation is
restricted to an affective system that is only updated through experiential
feedback of stimulus-outcome pairing, whereas the orbitofrontal cortex
contributes to an alternative system capable of inferential reasoning. Finally we
discuss the interactions and convergence of these systems and their implications 
for decision making and its pathology.

Over the past decade, neuroeconomics studies utilizing neurophysiology methods
(fMRI or EEG) have flourished, revealing the neural basis of 'boundedly rational'
or 'irrational' decision-making that violates normative theory. The next question
is how modulatory neurotransmission is involved in these central processes. Here 
I focused on recent efforts to understand how central monoamine transmission is
related to nonlinear probability weighting and loss aversion, central features of
prospect theory, which is a leading alternative to normative theory for
decision-making under risk. Circumstantial evidence suggests that dopamine tone
might be related to distortion of subjective reward probability and noradrenaline
and serotonin tone might influence aversive emotional reaction to potential loss.

This review considers recent work in neuroscience that has been thought to
challenge views of free will. I argue that these experiments do little to
directly undermine the belief that we have free will. However, evidence for
mechanism and automatic behaviors may cause us to rethink some commonsensical

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominant computational paradigm for
modeling psychological and neural aspects of affectively charged decision-making 
tasks. RL is normally construed in terms of the interaction between a subject and
its environment, with the former emitting actions, and the latter providing
stimuli, and appetitive and aversive reinforcement. However, there is recent
emphasis on redrawing the boundary between the two, with the organism
constructing its own notion of reward, punishment and state, and with internal
actions, such as the gating of working memory, being treated on an equal footing 
with external manipulation of the environment. We review recent work in this
area, focusing on cognitive control.

Social decision-making is arguably the most complex cognitive function performed 
by the human brain. This is due to two unique features of social decision-making.
First, predicting the behaviors of others is extremely difficult. Second, humans 
often take into consideration the well-beings of others during decision-making,
but this is influenced by many contextual factors. Despite such complexity,
studies on the neural basis of social decision-making have made substantial
progress in the last several years. They demonstrated that the core brain areas
involved in reinforcement learning and valuation, such as the ventral striatum
and orbitofrontal cortex, make important contribution to social decision-making. 
Furthermore, the contribution of brain systems implicated for theory of mind
during decision-making is being elucidated. Future studies are expected to
provide additional details about the nature of information channeled through
these brain areas.

23×74. However, this comes at a cost: flexible computations are slow and
effortful. We argue that this competence involves serial chains of successive
decisions, each based on the accumulation of evidence up to a threshold and
forwarding the result to the subsequent step. Such serial 'programs' require a
specific neurobiological architecture, approximating the operation of a slow
serial Turing machine. We review recent progress in understanding how the brain
implements such multi-step decisions and briefly examine how they might be
realized in models of primate cortex.

The hierarchical structure of human and animal behavior has been of critical
interest in neuroscience for many years. Yet understanding the neural processes
that give rise to such structure remains an open challenge. In recent research, a
new perspective on hierarchical behavior has begun to take shape, inspired by
ideas from machine learning, and in particular the framework of hierarchical
reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning builds on traditional
reinforcement learning mechanisms, extending them to accommodate temporally
extended behaviors or subroutines. The resulting computational paradigm has begun
to influence both theoretical and empirical work in neuroscience, conceptually
aligning the study of hierarchical behavior with research on other aspects of
learning and decision making, and giving rise to some thought-provoking new
findings.

How does the brain decide between actions? Is it through comparisons of abstract 
representations of outcomes or through a competition in a sensorimotor map
defining the actions themselves? Here, I review strengths and limitations of both
of these proposals, and suggest that decisions emerge through a distributed
consensus across many levels of representation.

Motor control is decision-making.

Wolpert DM(1), Landy MS.

Cambridge CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom.

Motor behavior may be viewed as a problem of maximizing the utility of movement
outcome in the face of sensory, motor and task uncertainty. Viewed in this way,
and allowing for the availability of prior knowledge in the form of a probability
distribution over possible states of the world, the choice of a movement plan and
strategy for motor control becomes an application of statistical decision theory.
This point of view has proven successful in recent years in accounting for
movement under risk, inferring the loss function used in motor tasks, and
explaining motor behavior in a wide variety of circumstances.

Computational models of decision making: integration, stability, and noise.

University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

Decision making demands the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Questions
remain about how this occurs, but recent years have seen progress on several
fronts. The first concerns when optimal accumulation of evidence coincides with
the simplest method of accumulating neural activity: summation over time. The
second involves what computations the brain might perform when summation is
difficult due to imprecision in neural circuits or is suboptimal due to
uncertainty or variability in how evidence arrives. Finally, the third concerns
sources of noise in decision circuits. Empirical studies have better constrained 
the extent of this noise, and modeling work is helping to clarify its possible
origins.

We evaluate the merits of different conceptualizations of frontal cortex function
in value-guided decision-making. According to one view each frontal cortical
region is concerned with a different aspect of the process of learning about and 
evaluating choices and then selecting actions. An alternative view, however, sees
sets of decision-making circuits working in parallel within the frontal lobes in 
order to make different types of decisions. While there is a neural circuit for
making choices between pairs of simultaneously presented items in the manner that
is frequently assessed in the laboratory, there is also evidence that other
frontal lobe circuits have evolved to make other types of choices such as those
made during the course of foraging.

New advances in understanding decisions among multiple alternatives.

Author information:

Experimental studies of decision-making have put a strong emphasis on choices
between two alternatives. However, real-life decisions often involve multiple
alternatives. This article provides an overview of theoretical frameworks that
have been proposed to account for behavioral data from both economic and
perceptual multialternative decision-making. We further review recent
neurophysiological data collected in conjunction with decision-making behavior.
These neural recordings provide constraints on putative models of the decision
mechanism. For example, the time course of inhibition provides insight into how
the competition between alternatives is mediated. Furthermore, whereas
decision-related neural activity seems to reach a common threshold at the end of 
the decision period, the starting point tends to depend systematically on the
number of alternatives. We discuss candidate mechanisms that could drive the
reduction in firing rates on decisions among multiple alternatives.

A major task of the central nervous system (CNS) is to control behavioral
actions, which necessitates a precise regulation of muscle activity. The final
components of the circuitry controlling muscles are the motorneurons, which
settle into pools in the ventral horn of the spinal cord in positions that mirror
the musculature organization within the body. This 'musculotopic' motor-map then 
becomes the internal CNS reference for the neuronal circuits that control motor
commands. This review describes recent progress in defining the neuroanatomical
organization of the higher-order motor circuits in the cortex and spinal cord,
and our current understanding of the integrative features that contribute to
complex motor behaviors. We highlight emerging evidence that cortical and spinal 
motor command centers are loosely organized with respect to the musculotopic
spatial-map, but these centers also incorporate organizational features that
associate with the function of different muscle groups during commonly enacted
behaviors.

Many lineage-specific genes are poised and silenced in stem cells. Upon
differentiation, genes that are related to self-renewal and alternative lineages 
are stably silenced. CpG methylation at proximal promoters and PRC2-mediated
H3K27me3 play a role in silencing genes temporarily or permanently, with or
without coexistence of active epigenetic marks, respectively. Interestingly, DNA 
methylation on neuronal genes that is distal to transcription start site enable
transcription activation owing to its ability to repel PRC2-mediated inhibition. 
In addition, DNA demethylase Tet proteins play a role in regulation of changes in
DNA methylation and related H3K27me3 during differentiation. Collectively, a
complex epigenetic network formed by H3K4me3, histone acetylation/deacetylation, 
H3K27me3 and DNA methylation/demethylation act together to regulate stem cell
self-renewal and differentiation.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental conditions such as
autism spectrum disorders have been studied intensively for decades. The
unavailability of live patient neurons for research, however, has represented a
major obstacle in the elucidation of the disease etiologies. Recently, the
development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows for the
generation of human neurons from somatic cells of patients. We review ongoing
studies using iPSCs as an approach to model neurodevelopmental disorders, the
promise and caveats of this technique and its potential for drug screening. The
reproducible findings of relevant phenotypes in Rett syndrome iPSC-derived
neurons suggest that iPSC technology offers a novel and unique opportunity for
the understanding of and the development of therapeutics for other autism
spectrum disorders.

PTEN germline mutations are found in a small subset of children diagnosed with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and accompanying macrocephaly. In this review, we 
discuss recent advances that offer insight into the pathogenesis of this subgroup
of autism patients. We provide an overview of how disrupting PTEN function
influences neuronal cells, and describe efforts to decipher the cellular
mechanisms associated with altered social behaviors. We discuss the PTEN
downstream signaling pathways that likely mediate these cellular and behavioral
effects. In addition, emerging data suggest that PTEN mutation can synergize with
mutations in other autism susceptibility genes to contribute to the development
of autistic behaviors. These studies extend our knowledge of PTEN and the PTEN
signaling pathway, and offer molecular and cellular clues to better understand
the etiology of ASDs.

Down syndrome (DS) is a multi-faceted condition resulting in the most common
genetic form of intellectual disability. Mouse models of DS, especially the
Ts65Dn model, have been pivotal in furthering our understanding of the genetic,
molecular and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie learning and memory
impairments in DS. Cognitive and pharmacological insights from the Ts65Dn mouse
model have led to remarkable translational progress in the development of
therapeutic targets and in the emergence of DS clinical trials. Unravelling the
pathogenic role of trisomic genes on human chromosome 21 and the
genotype-phenotype relationship still remains a pertinent goal for tackling
cognitive deficits in DS.

Recently we have witnessed an array of studies on direct reprogramming that
describe induced inter conversion of mature cell types from higher organisms
including human. While these studies reveal an unexpected level of plasticity of 
differentiated somatic cells, they also provide unprecedented opportunities to
develop regenerative therapies for many debilitating disorders and model these
'diseases-in-a-dish' for studying their pathophysiology. Here we review the
current state of the art in direct lineage reprogramming to neural cells, and
discuss the challenges that need to be addressed toward achieving the full
potential of this exciting new technology.

A prominent feature of nervous systems is the organization of synapses into
discrete layers, or laminae. Such laminae are essential for the spatial
segregation of synaptic connections conveying different types of information. A
prime example of this is the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the vertebrate
retina, which is subdivided into at least ten sublaminae. Another example gaining
prominence is the layered neuropil of the zebrafish optic tectum. Three recent
papers have shed light on the extracellular signals that control the precise
stratification of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal processes in these two areas.
The new studies implicate well-known axon guidance cues, including class 5 and 6 
semaphorins in the retina, as well as Slit in the optic tectum. Remarkably, the
short-range action of Slit, which is required for neurite stratification, appears
to be achieved by anchoring the secreted guidance factor to the basement membrane
at the surface of the tectum.

The establishment of a dendritic tree is a highly dynamic process characterized
by extension and retraction of branches, followed by stabilization of existing
dendrites and synaptic connections. To properly cover the receptive fields, all
of these processes are tightly coordinated at all time points. Recent in vivo
studies suggest that several signaling pathways, including Hippo pathway and
epigenetic mechanisms, play important roles in maintenance of matured dendrites. 
This review focuses on the current molecular understanding of how established
dendritic fields in functional neuronal circuits are maintained in the brain. The
relevance of this knowledge to the pathological mechanisms underlying some
neurodegenerative disorders is also discussed.

X-linked Infantile Spasms Syndrome (ISSX) is a catastrophic epilepsy of early
childhood with intractable seizures, intellectual disability, and poor prognosis.
A spectrum of mutations in the Aristaless-Related Homeobox gene (ARX) has been
linked to ISSX, and downstream targets of this interneuron-expressed
transcription factor are being defined. Recent advances combining in vitro and in
vivo methods have unveiled complex interactions between Arx and its binding
partners and their effects on cell migration and maturation that can help explain
the diversity of ARX phenotypes. New mutant mouse models of Arx-induced
pathology, including a recent human triplet-repeat expansion mutation with a
phenotype of infantile spasms and electrographic seizures, provide valuable tools
for exploring the pathophysiology of Arx and substrates for testing novel
therapies.

Developmental origins of brain tumors.

Brain tumors are devastating owing to the high fatality rate and the devastating 
impact on life qualities of patients. Recent advancement of comparative
transcriptome profiling tools and mouse genetic models has greatly deepened our
understanding of the developmental origins of these tumors, which could lead to
effective therapeutic strategies. We review recent progresses in three types of
brain tumors: ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and malignant glioma. The conceptual
framework established by these studies converged on three important aspects.
First, subtypes in each tumor group originate from distinct cell types. Second,
each cell-of-origin is uniquely susceptible to some but not other genetic
mutations. Lastly, mutant stem cells may not transform until they differentiate
into more restricted progenitor cell type. Overall, these findings indicate the
existence of intricate interactions between gene mutations and developmental
program for the formation of brain tumors.

The migration of neurons along glial fibers from a germinal zone (GZ) to their
final laminar positions is essential for morphogenesis of the developing brain;
aberrations in this process are linked to profound neurodevelopmental and
cognitive disorders. During this critical morphogenic movement, neurons must
navigate complex migration paths, propelling their cell bodies through the dense 
cellular environment of the developing nervous system to their final
destinations. It is not understood how neurons can successfully migrate along
their glial guides through the myriad processes and cell bodies of neighboring
neurons. Although much progress has been made in understanding the substrates

interact with crucial neurodevelopmental events, such as GZ exit, migration
pathway selection, multipolar-to-radial transition, and final lamination.

The genetic basis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases has been
advanced by the discovery of large and recurrent copy number variants
significantly enriched in cases when compared to controls. The pattern of this
variation strongly implies that rare variants contribute significantly to
neurological disease; that different genes will be responsible for similar
diseases in different families; and that the same 'primary' genetic lesions can
result in a different disease outcome depending potentially on the genetic
background. Next-generation sequencing technologies are beginning to broaden the 
spectrum of disease-causing variation and provide specificity by pinpointing both
genes and pathways for future diagnostics and therapeutics.

Genetic disorders that present with a high incidence of autism spectrum disorders
(ASD) offer tremendous potential both for elucidating the underlying neurobiology
of ASD and identifying therapeutic drugs and/or drug targets. As a result,
clinical trials for genetic disorders associated with ASD are no longer a hope
for the future but rather an exciting reality whose time has come. Tuberous
sclerosis complex (TSC) is one such genetic disorder that presents with ASD,
epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Cell culture and mouse model experiments
have identified the mTOR pathway as a therapeutic target in this disease. This
review summarizes the advantages of using TSC as model of ASD and the recent
advances in the translational and clinical treatment trials in TSC.

In any mitotic cell, the orientation of the mitotic spindle determines the
orientation of the cleavage plane and therefore the position of the two daughter 
cells. When combined with polarization of cellular components, spindle
orientation is also a well-conserved means of generating daughter cells with
asymmetric cell fates, such as progenitors and differentiated cell types. In the 
mammalian neocortex, the precise planar spindle orientation observed early during
development is vital for symmetric proliferative divisions. During later stages, 
spindles can be oblique or even vertical but the role of this reorientation is
somewhat less clear as asymmetric cell fates can arise independently of spindle
orientation during this stage. Although decades of work have identified many key 
conserved regulators of spindle positioning, its precise role in cell fate
determination in the mammalian neocortex has been enigmatic. Recent work focused 
on mInsc and LGN has now revealed an important role for spindle orientation in
determination of specific asymmetric cell fates, namely intermediate progenitors 
and a new progenitor population, termed outer radial glia. In this way, spindle
orientation helps determine the neurogenic outcome of asymmetric progenitor
divisions, thereby influencing neuron output and cerebral cortical expansion.

Continuously generated new neurons promote circuitry plasticity within
specialized regions and contribute to specific functions of the adult mammalian
brain. A number of recent studies have investigated the cellular origin of adult 
neurogenesis in the hippocampus, yielding divergent models of neural stem cell
behavior. An essential question remains whether these models are overlapping or
fundamentally discrete. We review evidence that primary neural precursors in the 
adult hippocampus exhibit significant heterogeneity in their properties of
self-renewal, multi-lineage differentiation and regulation, representing a range 
from unipotential committed precursors to bona fide self-renewing multipotent
neural stem cells. We further present a testable unifying hypothesis of adult
neural stem cell behavior in vivo to outline a common framework for future
studies of molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating adult neural stem cells
and how these cells may contribute to hippocampal function and repair.

Neural control of locomotion in human adults involves the generation of a small
set of basic patterned commands directed to the leg muscles. The commands are
generated sequentially in time during each step by neural networks located in the
spinal cord, called Central Pattern Generators. This review outlines recent
advances in understanding how motor commands are expressed at different stages of
human development. Similar commands are found in several other vertebrates,
indicating that locomotion development follows common principles of organization 
of the control networks. Movements show a high degree of flexibility at all
stages of development, which is instrumental for learning and exploration of
variable interactions with the environment.

Recent discoveries concerning the architecture and cellular dynamics of the
developing human brain are revealing new differences between mouse and human
cortical development. In mice, neurons are produced by ventricular radial glial
(RG) cells and subventricular zone intermediate progenitor (IP) cells. In the
human cortex, both ventricular RG and highly motile outer RG cells generate IP
cells, which undergo multiple rounds of transit amplification in the outer
subventricular zone before producing neurons. This creates a more complex
environment for neurogenesis and neuronal migration, adding new arenas in which
neurodevelopmental disease gene mutation could disrupt corticogenesis. A more
complete understanding of disease mechanisms will involve use of emerging model
systems with developmental programs more similar to that of the human neocortex.

Fragile X syndrome: mechanistic insights and therapeutic avenues regarding the
role of potassium channels.

Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of mental disability and one of the
known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of 
the trinucleotide CGG repeats that leads to DNA methylation of the fragile X
mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1) and transcriptional silencing, resulting in the 
absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA binding protein. 
Although it is widely known that FMRP is critical for metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), which has provided a
general theme for developing pharmacological drugs for FXS, specific downstream
targets of FMRP may also be of therapeutic value. Since alterations in potassium 
channel expression level or activity could underlie neuronal network defects in
FXS, here we describe recent findings on how these channels might be altered in
mouse models of FXS and the possible therapeutic avenues for treating FXS.

A growing understanding of the genetic origins of autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs) and the impact of ASD risk genes on synaptic function presents new
opportunities for drug discovery. Large-scale human genetics studies have begun
to reveal molecular pathways and potential therapeutic drug targets. Subsequent
validation and characterization of ASD risk genes in mouse models holds promise
for defining relevant cellular mechanisms and brain circuits associated with the 
core behavioral symptoms of autism. Here we review recent advances in the
molecular therapeutics in ASDs and discuss opportunities and obstacles for
converting emerging biology into new medicines. We present emerging concepts on
the impact of risk genes during development and adulthood that define points of
intervention. We further highlight ongoing clinical trials in patients with
syndromic forms of autism. These clinical studies will be an important test of
the utility of human genetics as a starting point for drug discovery in ASDs.

As astrocytes are becoming recognized as important mediators of normal brain
function, studies into their roles in neurological disease have gained
significance. Across mouse models for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
diseases, astrocytes are considered key regulators of disease progression. In
Rett syndrome and Parkinson's disease, astrocytes can even initiate certain
disease phenotypes. Numerous potential mechanisms have been offered to explain
these results, but research into the functions of astrocytes in disease is just
beginning. Crucially, in vivo verification of in vitro data is still necessary,
as well as a deeper understanding of the complex and relatively unexplored
interactions between astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons.

Many candidate genes are now thought to confer susceptibility to autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs). Here we review four interrelated complexes, each composed of
multiple families of genes that functionally coalesce on common cellular
pathways. We illustrate a common thread in the organization of glutamatergic
synapses and suggest a link between genes involved in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,
Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome and several synaptic ASD candidate genes.
When viewed in this context, progress in deciphering the molecular architecture
of cellular protein-protein interactions together with the unraveling of synaptic
dysfunction in neural networks may prove pivotal to advancing our understanding
of ASDs.

In vitro neural differentiation culture of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provides a
promising tool for preparing neural cells for replacement therapies and a
versatile system for understanding mechanisms of neurogenesis. Consistent with
the neural-default model, neural differentiation spontaneously occurs in ESCs
cultured in medium containing minimal extrinsic signals. Both adherent monolayer 
culture and floating aggregation culture can be used for ESC conversion into
neural progenitors. The floating aggregation culture has an advantage for
recapitulating the formation of three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue structure
such as layer formation. In this article, we review recent progress in neural
differentiation culture of ESCs using 3D culture, focusing on self-organization
phenomena of stratified cortex and retinal tissues. These self-organizing
processes are driven by both cell intrinsic programs and local cell-cell
interactions. A simple in vitro system using ESCs is useful for elucidating
mechanistic dynamics in the complex orchestration of neural development.

Axon pathfinding is essential for the establishment of proper neuronal
connections during development. Advances in neuroimaging and genomic
technologies, coupled with animal modeling, are leading to the identification of 
an increasing number of human disorders that result from aberrant axonal wiring. 
In this review, we summarize the recent clinical, genetic and molecular advances 
with regard to three human disorders of axon guidance: Horizontal gaze palsy with
progressive scoliosis, Congenital mirror movements, and Congenital fibrosis of
the extraocular muscles, Type III.

The analysis of stimulus/response patterns using information theoretic approaches
requires the full probability distribution of stimuli and response. Recent
progress in using information-based tools to understand circuit function has
advanced understanding of neural coding at the single cell and population level. 
In advances over traditional reverse correlation approaches, the determination of
receptive fields using information as a metric has allowed novel insights into
stimulus representation and transformation. The application of maximum entropy
methods to population codes has opened a rich exploration of the internal
structure of these codes, revealing stimulus-driven functional connectivity. We
speculate about the prospects and limitations of information as a general tool
for dissecting neural circuits and relating their structure and function.

Neuronal microcircuits for decision making in C. elegans.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.

The simplicity and genetic tractability of the nervous system of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans make it an attractive system in which to seek biological
mechanisms of decision making. Although work in this area remains at an early
stage, four basic types paradigms of behavioral choice, a simple form of decision
making, have now been demonstrated in C. elegans. A recent series of pioneering
studies, combining genetics and molecular biology with new techniques such as
microfluidics and calcium imaging in freely moving animals, has begun to
elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying behavioral choice. The new research 
has focussed on choice behaviors in the context of habitat and resource
localization, for which the neuronal circuit has been identified. Three main
circuit motifs for behavioral choice have been identified. One motif is based
mainly on changes in the strength of synaptic connections whereas the other two
motifs are based on changes in the basal activity of an interneuron and the
sensory neuron to which it is electrically coupled. Peptide signaling seems to
play a prominent role in all three motifs, and it may be a general rule that
concentrations of various peptides encode the internal states that influence
behavioral decisions in C. elegans.

The insular cortex is the primary cortical site devoted to taste processing. A
large body of evidence is available for how insular neurons respond to gustatory 
stimulation in both anesthetized and behaving animals. Most of the reports
describe broadly tuned neurons that are involved in processing the chemosensory, 
physiological and psychological aspects of gustatory experience. However little
is known about how these neural responses map onto insular circuits. Particularly
mysterious is the functional role of the three subdivisions of the insular
cortex: the granular, the dysgranular and the agranular insular cortices. In this
article we review data on the organization of the local and long-distance
circuits in the three subdivisions. The functional significance of these results 
is discussed in light of the latest electrophysiological data. A view of the
insular cortex as a functionally integrated system devoted to processing
gustatory, multimodal, cognitive and affective information is proposed.

Glutamatergic pathways dominate information processing in the brain, but these
are not homogeneous. They include two distinct types: Class 1, which carries the 
main information for processing, and Class 2, which serves a modulatory role.
Identifying the Class 1 inputs in a circuit can lead to a better understanding of
its function. Also, identifying Class 1 inputs to a thalamic nucleus tells us its
main function (e.g. the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN, is the relay of
retinal Class 1 input), and such identification leads to a division of thalamic
relays into first and higher order: the former receives Class 1 inputs from
subcortical sources; the latter, from layer 5 of cortex, which it then relays to 
another cortical area. When a cortical area directly connects with another, it
often has a parallel, transthalamic connection through these higher order relays.
This leads to a novel appreciation of cortical functioning and raises many new
questions.

Understanding vertebrate vision depends on knowing, in part, the complete network
graph of at least one representative retina. Acquiring such graphs is the
business of synaptic connectomics, emerging as a practical technology due to
improvements in electron imaging platform control, management software for
large-scale datasets, and availability of data storage. The optimal strategy for 
building complete connectomes uses transmission electron imaging with 2 nm or
better resolution, molecular tags for cell identification, open-access data
volumes for navigation, and annotation with open-source tools to build 3D cell
libraries, complete network diagrams and connectivity databases. The first forays
into retinal connectomics have shown that even nominally well-studied cells have 
much richer connection graphs than expected.

Medullary circuits for nociceptive modulation.

States. p-mason@uchicago.edu

Neurons in the medullary raphe are critical to opioid analgesia through
descending projections to the dorsal horn. Work in anesthetized rats led to the
postulate that nociceptive suppression results from tonic activation of
nociceptive-inhibiting neurons and tonic inhibition of nociceptive-facilitating
neurons. However, morphine does not cause tonic changes in raphe neuronal firing 
in unanesthetized rodents. Recent work suggests that a drop in activity of
nociceptive-inhibiting neurons synchronizes nociceptive circuits and a burst of
activity in nociceptive-facilitating neurons facilitates withdrawal magnitude.
After morphine, the phasic responses of raphe cells are suppressed along with
nociceptive withdrawals. The results suggest a new model of brainstem modulation 
of nociception in which the medullary raphe facilitates nociceptive reactions
when noxious input occurs and may modulate other functions between injurious
events.

Many neural circuits process information in multiple distinct modes. For example,
the hippocampus is involved in memory encoding, retrieval, and consolidation
processes. These different mnemonic computations require processing of differing 
balances of current sensory input and previously stored associations. Here we
explore patterns of activity in hippocampal output area CA1 associated with
different information processing states. We discuss the evidence linking these
patterns to specific inputs to CA1 and describe behavioral factors that are
related to the balance of synaptic drive. We suggest that understanding the
factors that influence information flow in the hippocampal circuit could provide 
important new insights into how neural circuits are reconfigured on the fly to
perform different functions at different times.

Dynamics of neuronal networks can be altered in at least two ways: by changes in 
connectivity, that is, the physical architecture of the network, or changes in
the amplitudes and kinetics of the intrinsic and synaptic currents within and
between the elements making up a network. We argue that the latter changes are
often overlooked as sources of alterations in network behavior when there are
also structural (connectivity) abnormalities present; indeed, they may even give 
rise to the structural changes observed in these states. Here we look at two
clinically relevant states (Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia) and argue that
non-structural changes are important in the development of abnormal dynamics
within the networks known to be relevant to each disorder. We also discuss
anesthesia, since it is entirely acute, thus illustrating the potent effects of
changes in synaptic and intrinsic membrane currents in the absence of structural 
alteration. In each of these, we focus on the role of changes in GABAergic
function within microcircuits, stressing literature within the last few years.

The postural system maintains a specific body orientation and equilibrium during 
standing and during locomotion in the presence of many destabilizing factors
(external and internal). Numerous studies in humans have revealed essential
features of the functional organization of this system. Recent studies on
different animal models have significantly supplemented human studies. They have 
greatly expanded our knowledge of how the control system operates, how the
postural functions are distributed within different parts of CNS, and how these
parts interact with each other to produce postural corrections and adjustments.
This review outlines recent advances in the studies of postural control in
quadrupeds, with special attention given the neuronal postural mechanisms.

This review summarizes the latest developments in our understanding of amygdala
networks that support classical fear conditioning, the experimental paradigm most
commonly used to study learned fear in the laboratory. These recent advances have
considerable translational significance as congruent findings from studies of
fear learning in animals and humans indicate that anxiety disorders result from
abnormalities in the mechanisms that normally regulate conditioned fear. Because 
of the introduction of new techniques and the continued use of traditional
approaches, it is becoming clear that conditioned fear involves much more complex
networks than initially believed, including coordinated interactions between
multiple excitatory and inhibitory circuits within the amygdala.

Precision of synaptic connections in neuronal circuits is the product of an
orderly assembly process during development. Circuits controlling motor behavior 
have been studied extensively in many animal species, allowing an assessment of
evolutionarily conserved organizational principles that underlie neuronal subtype
specification, connectivity and function. Across phylogenetically distant
species, motor circuit assembly is based on spatial organization of
interconnected circuit elements. Developmental molecular coordinate systems
demarcate dendritic and axonal targeting territories, thereby regulating
convergence of synaptic partners. Additional mechanisms subsequently control fine
synaptic connection specificity within these domains. Spatial organization often 
correlates with the orderly sequence of neurogenesis contributing to the
generation of distinct postmitotic neuronal subpopulations, a developmental
strategy implemented far beyond motor circuits.

Pain, itch, heat, cold, and touch represent different percepts arising from
somatosensory input. How stimuli give rise to these percepts has been debated for
over a century. Recent work supports the view that primary afferents are highly
specialized to transduce and encode specific stimulus modalities. However,
cross-modal interactions (e.g. inhibition or exacerbation of pain by touch)
support convergence rather than specificity in central circuits. We outline how
peripheral specialization together with central convergence could enable spinal
microcircuits to combine inputs from distinctly specialized, co-activated
afferents and to modulate the output signals thus formed through computations
like normalization. These issues will be discussed alongside recent advances in
our understanding of microcircuitry in the superficial dorsal horn.

Motor behaviors result from information processing that occurs in multiple neural
networks acting at all levels from the initial selection of the behavior to its
final generation. A long-standing research interest is how single neural networks
can help generate different motor behaviors, that is, the origin of motor
flexibility. Modern experimental techniques allow studying neural network
activity during the production of multiple motor behaviors. Recent data provide
strong evidence that the neural networks controlling insect legs are individually
modified in task-dependent and finely tuned fashions. Understanding the
mechanistic basis of these neural network modifications will be of particular
interest in the upcoming years.

Oscillatory, population activities have long been known to occur in our brains
during different behavioral states. We know that many different cell types exist 
and that they contribute in distinct ways to the generation of these activities. 
I review recent papers that involve cellular-based models of brain networks, most
of which include theta, gamma and sharp wave-ripple activities. To help organize 
the modeling work, I present it from a perspective of three different types of
cellular-based modeling: 'Generic', 'Biophysical' and 'Linking'. Cellular-based
modeling is taken to encompass the four features of experiment, model
development, theory/analyses, and model usage/computation. The three modeling
types are shown to include these features and interactions in different ways.

Spinal cord development is a complex process involving generation of the
appropriate number of cells, acquisition of distinctive phenotypes and
establishment of functional connections that enable execution of critical
functions such as sensation and locomotion. Here we review the basic cellular
events occurring during spinal cord development, highlighting studies that
demonstrate the roles of electrical activity in this process. We conclude that
the participation of different forms of electrical activity is evident from the
beginning of spinal cord development and intermingles with other developmental
cues and programs to implement dynamic and integrated control of spinal cord
function.

Small is beautiful: models of small neuronal networks.

Modeling has contributed a great deal to our understanding of how individual
neurons and neuronal networks function. In this review, we focus on models of the
small neuronal networks of invertebrates, especially rhythmically active CPG
networks. Models have elucidated many aspects of these networks, from identifying
key interacting membrane properties to pointing out gaps in our understanding,
for example missing neurons. Even the complex CPGs of vertebrates, such as those 
that underlie respiration, have been reduced to small network models to great
effect. Modeling of these networks spans from simplified models, which are
amenable to mathematical analyses, to very complicated biophysical models. Some
researchers have now adopted a population approach, where they generate and
analyze many related models that differ in a few to several judiciously chosen
free parameters; often these parameters show variability across animals and thus 
justify the approach. Models of small neuronal networks will continue to expand
and refine our understanding of how neuronal networks in all animals program
motor output, process sensory information and learn.

Temperature has widespread and diverse effects on different subcellular
components of neuronal circuits making it difficult to predict precisely the
overall influence on output. Increases in temperature generally increase the
output rate in either an exponential or a linear manner. Circuits with a slow
output tend to respond exponentially with relatively high Q(10)s, whereas those
with faster outputs tend to respond in a linear fashion with relatively low
temperature coefficients. Different attributes of the circuit output can be
compensated by virtue of opposing processes with similar temperature
coefficients. At the extremes of the temperature range, differences in the
temperature coefficients of circuit mechanisms cannot be compensated and the
circuit fails, often with a reversible loss of ion homeostasis. Prior experience 
of temperature extremes activates conserved processes of phenotypic plasticity
that tune neuronal circuits to be better able to withstand the effects of
temperature and to recover more rapidly from failure.

Neural codes often seem tailored to the type of information they must carry. Here
we contrast the encoding strategies for two different communication signals in
electric fish and describe the underlying cellular and network properties that
implement them. We compare an aggressive signal that needs to be quickly
detected, to a courtship signal whose quality needs to be evaluated. The
aggressive signal is encoded by synchronized bursts and a predictive feedback
input is crucial in separating background noise from the communication signal.
The courtship signal is accurately encoded through a heterogenous population
response allowing the discrimination of signal differences. Most importantly we
show that the same strategies are used in other systems arguing that they evolved
similar solutions because they faced similar tasks.

Neuropeptides provide functional flexibility to microcircuits, their inputs and
effectors by modulating presynaptic and postsynaptic properties and intrinsic
currents. Recent studies have relied less on applied neuropeptide and more on
their neural release. In rhythmically active microcircuits (central pattern
generators, CPGs), recent studies show that neuropeptide modulation can enable
particular activity patterns by organizing specific circuit motifs. Neuropeptides
can also modify microcircuit output indirectly, by modulating circuit inputs.
Recently elucidated consequences of neuropeptide modulation include changes in
motor patterns and behavior, stabilization of rhythmic motor patterns and changes
in CPG sensitivity to sensory input. One aspect of neuropeptide modulation that
remains enigmatic is the presence of multiple peptide family members in the same 
nervous system and even the same neurons.

Drosophila melanogaster has historically been the premier model system for
understanding the molecular and genetic bases of complex behaviors. In the last
decade technical advances, in the form of new genetic tools and
electrophysiological and optical methods, have allowed investigators to begin to 
dissect the neuronal circuits that generate behavior in the adult. The blossoming
of circuit analysis in this organism has also reinforced our appreciation of the 
inadequacy of wiring diagrams for specifying complex behavior. Neuromodulation
and neuronal plasticity act to reconfigure circuits on both short and long time
scales. These processes act on the connectome, providing context by integrating
external and internal cues that are relevant for behavioral choices. New
approaches in the fly are providing insight into these basic principles of
circuit function.

Breathing is a rhythmic motor behavior generated and controlled by hindbrain
neuronal networks. Respiratory motor output arises from two distinct, but
functionally interacting, rhythmogenic networks: the pre-Bötzinger complex
(preBötC) and the retrotrapezoïd nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG).
This review outlines recent advances in delineating the genetic specification of 
the neuronal constituents of these two rhythmogenic networks, their respective
roles in respiratory function and how they interact to constitute a functional
respiratory circuit ensemble. The often lethal consequences of disruption to
these networks found in naturally occurring developmental disorders, transgenic
animals, and highly specific lesion studies are described. In addition, we
discuss how recent computational models enhance our understanding of how
respiratory networks generate and regulate respiratory behavior.

The specialized morphology of dendritic spines creates an isolated compartment
that allows for localized biochemical signaling. Recent studies have revealed
complexity in the function of the spine head as a signaling domain and indicate
that (1) the spine is functionally subdivided into multiple independent
microdomains and (2) not all biochemical signals are equally compartmentalized
within the spine. Here we review these findings as well as the developments in
fluorescence microscopy that are making possible direct monitoring of signaling
within spines and, in the future, within sub-spine microdomains.

Neurexins (NXs) and neuroligins (NLs) are transsynaptically interacting cell
adhesion proteins that play a key role in the formation, maturation,
activity-dependent validation, and maintenance of synapses. As complex
alternative splicing processes in nerve cells generate a large number of NX and
NLs variants, it has been proposed that a combinatorial interaction code
generated by these variants may determine synapse identity and network
connectivity during brain development. The functional importance of NXs and NLs
is exemplified by the fact that mutations in NX and NL genes are associated with 
several neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably with autism. Accordingly, major 
research efforts have focused on the molecular mechanisms by which NXs and NLs
operate at synapses. In this review, we summarize recent progress in this field
and discuss emerging topics, such as the role of alternative interaction partners
of NXs and NLs in synapse formation and function, and their relevance for
synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. The novel findings highlight the
fundamental importance of NX-NL interactions in a wide range of synaptic
functions.

The human synapse proteome is a highly complex collection of proteins that is
disrupted by hundreds of gene mutations causing over 100 brain diseases. These
synaptic diseases, or synaptopathies, cause major psychiatric, neurological and
childhood developmental disorders through mendelian and complex genetic
mechanisms. The human postsynaptic proteome and its core signaling complexes
built by the assembly of receptors and enzymes around Membrane Associated
Guanylate Kinase (MAGUK) scaffold proteins are a paradigm for systematic analysis
of synaptic diseases. In humans, the MAGUK Associated Signaling Complexes are
mutated in Autism, Schizophrenia, Intellectual Disability and many other
diseases, and mice carrying orthologous mutations show relevant cognitive,
social, motoric and other phenotypes. Diseases with similar phenotypes and
symptom spectrums arise from disruption of complexes and interacting proteins
within the synapse proteome. Classifying synaptic disease phenotypes with genetic
and proteome data provides a new brain disease classification system based on
molecular etiology and pathogenesis.

Cell growth and differentiation in developing tissues are, at first impression,
quite different endeavors from readjusting synaptic strength during
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in mature neurons. Nevertheless, it is
becoming increasingly clear that these two distinct processes share multiple
intracellular signaling events. How these common pathways result in cell division
(during proliferation), large-scale cellular remodeling (during differentiation) 
or synapse-specific changes (during synaptic plasticity) is only starting to be
elucidated. Here we review the latest findings on two prototypical examples of
these shared mechanisms: the Ras-PI3K pathway and the intracellular signaling
elicited by neural cell adhesion molecules interacting with growth factor
receptors.

transmission mediated by AMPA receptors, an expanding body of evidence indicates 
that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) themselves are also dynamically regulated and
subject to activity-dependent long-term plasticity. NMDARs can significantly
contribute to information transfer at synapses particularly during periods of
repetitive activity. It is also increasingly recognized that NMDARs participate
in dendritic synaptic integration and are critical for generating persistent
activity of neural assemblies. Here we review recent advances on the mechanisms
and functional consequences of NMDAR plasticity. Given the unique biophysical
properties of NMDARs, synaptic plasticity of NMDAR-mediated transmission emerges 
as a particularly powerful mechanism for the fine tuning of information encoding 
and storage throughout the brain.

To gain insights into structure-function relationship of excitatory synapses, we 
revisit our quantitative analysis of synaptic AMPAR by highly sensitive
freeze-fracture replica labeling in eight different connections. All of these
connections showed linear correlation between synapse size and AMPAR number
indicating a common intra-synapse-type relationship in CNS synapses. On the
contrary, inter-synapse-type relationship is unexpected indicating no correlation
between averages of synapse size and AMPAR number. Interestingly, connections
with large average synapse size and low AMPAR density showed high variability of 
AMPAR number and mosaic distribution within the postsynaptic membrane. We propose
an idea that these connections may quickly exhibit synaptic plasticity by
modifying AMPAR density/number whereas those with high AMPAR density change their
efficacy by modifying synapse size.

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic
transmission in the brain. Dynamic changes in neuronal synaptic efficacy, termed 
synaptic plasticity, are thought to underlie information coding and storage in
learning and memory. One major mechanism that regulates synaptic strength
involves the tightly regulated trafficking of AMPARs into and out of synapses.
The life cycle of AMPARs from their biosynthesis, membrane trafficking, and
synaptic targeting to their degradation are controlled by a series of
orchestrated interactions with numerous intracellular regulatory proteins. Here
we review recent progress made toward the understanding the regulation of AMPAR
trafficking, focusing on the roles of several key intracellular AMPAR interacting
proteins.

Structural plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses is an essential mechanism 
to sustain long lasting changes in the brain with learning and experience. The
use of electron microscopy over the last several decades has advanced our
understanding of the magnitude and extent of structural plasticity at a nanoscale
resolution. In particular, serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) provides
accurate measurements of plasticity-related changes in synaptic size and density 
and distribution of key cellular resources such as polyribosomes, smooth
endoplasmic reticulum, and synaptic vesicles. Careful attention to experimental
and analytical approaches ensures correct interpretation of ultrastructural data 
and has begun to reveal the degree to which synapses undergo structural
remodeling in response to physiological plasticity.

What causes the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia? The 
importance of circuits is underscored by the finding that no single gene
contributes strongly to the disease. Thus, some circuit abnormality to which many
proteins can contribute is the likely cause. There are several major hypotheses
regarding the circuitry involved: first, a change in the balance of
excitation/inhibition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); second, abnormal EEG
oscillations in the gamma range; third, an increase in theta/delta EEG power
related to changes in the thalamus (particularly midline nuclei); fourth,
hyperactivity in the hippocampus and consequent dopamine hyperfunction; and
fifth, deficits in corollary discharge. Evidence for these hypotheses will be
reviewed.

The active regulation of spine structure and function is of fundamental
importance for information storage in the brain. Many proteins involved in spine 
development and activity-dependent remodelling are potential or validated
substrates for modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). The
functional consequences of neuronal protein SUMOylation appear diverse and, in
many cases, have not yet been determined. However, for several proteins
SUMOylation has been shown to be a key regulator, which has a profound impact on 
spine dynamics and protein trafficking and function. Here we provide an overview 
of neuronal SUMOylation and discuss how greater understanding of this relatively 
recently discovered posttranslational modification will provide insight into the 
complexity of protein interactions that control synaptic activity and
dysfunction.

Excitatory synaptic transmission is largely mediated by AMPA receptors (AMPARs)
present at the postsynaptic density. Recent studies in single molecule tracking
of AMPAR has revealed that extrasynaptic AMPARs are highly mobile and thus might 
serve as a readily available pool for their synaptic recruitment during synaptic 
plasticity events such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Because this hypothesis
relies on the cell's ability to increase the number of diffusional traps or
'slots' at synapses during LTP, we will review a number of protein-protein
interactions that might impact AMPARs lateral diffusion and thus potentially
serve as slots. Recent studies have identified the interaction between the
AMPAR-Stargazin complex and PSD-95 as the minimal components of the diffusional
trapping slot. We will overview the molecular basis of this critical interaction,
its activity-dependent regulation and its potential contribution to LTP.

Depolarization gates spine calcium transients and spike-timing-dependent
potentiation.

Hao J(1), Oertner TG.

Author information: 
(1)Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, CH-4058 Basel,
Switzerland.

Timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) is induced when synaptic activity
is immediately followed by one or more back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) 
in the postsynaptic cell. As a mechanistic explanation, it has been proposed that
the bAP removes the Mg2+ block of synaptic NMDA receptors, allowing for rapid
Ca2+ entry at the active synapse. Recent experimental studies suggest that this
model is incomplete: NMDA receptor-based coincidence detection requires strong
postsynaptic depolarization, usually provided by AMPA receptor currents.
Apparently, the brief AMPA-EPSP does not only enable t-LTP, it is also
responsible for the very narrow time window for t-LTP induction. The emerging
consensus puts the spine in the center of coincidence detection, as active
conductances on the spine together with the electrical resistance of the spine
neck regulate the depolarization of the spine head and thus Ca2+ influx during
pairing. A focus on postsynaptic voltage during synaptic activation not only
encompasses spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), but explains also the
cooperativity and frequency-dependence of plasticity.

Ave, Boston, MA 02111, USA.

Inhibitory neurotransmission is primarily governed by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
type A receptors (GABAARs). GABAARs are heteropentameric ligand-gated channels
formed by the combination of 19 possible subunits. GABAAR subunits are subject to
multiple types of regulation, impacting the localization, properties, and
function of assembled receptors. GABAARs mediate both phasic (synaptic) and tonic
(extrasynaptic) inhibition. While the regulatory mechanisms governing synaptic
receptors have begun to be defined, little is known about the regulation of
extrasynaptic receptors. We examine the contributions of GABAARs to the
pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia, depression,
epilepsy, and stroke, with particular focus on extrasynaptic GABAARs. We suggest 
that extrasynaptic GABAARs are attractive targets for the treatment of these
disorders, and that research should be focused on delineating the mechanisms that
regulate extrasynaptic GABAARs, promoting new therapeutic approaches.

The unique ability of chemical synapses to transmit information relies on the
structural organization of presynaptic terminals. Empowered by forward genetics, 
research using Caenorhabditis elegans has continued to make pivotal contributions
to discover conserved regulators and pathways for presynaptic development. Recent
advances in microscopy have begun to pave the path for linking molecular dynamics
with subsynaptic structures. Studies using diverse reporters for synapses further
broaden the landscape of regulatory mechanisms underlying presynaptic
differentiation. The identification of novel regulators at transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels raises new questions for understanding synapse
formation at the genomic scale.

Excessive synapses generated during early development are eliminated extensively 
to form functionally mature neural circuits. Synapses in juvenile and mature
brains are highly dynamic, and undergo remodeling processes through constant
formation and elimination of dendritic spines. Although neural activity has been 
implicated in initiating the synapse elimination process cell-autonomously, the
cellular and molecular mechanisms that transduce changes in correlated neural
activity into structural changes in synapses are largely unknown. Recently,
however, new findings provide evidence that in different species, glial cells,
non-neuronal cell types in the nervous system are crucial in eliminating neural
debris and unwanted synapses through phagocytosis. Glial cells not only clear
fragmented axons and synaptic debris produced during synapse elimination, but
also engulf unwanted synapses thereby actively promoting synapse elimination
non-cell autonomously. These new findings support the important role of glial
cells in the formation and maintenance of functional neural circuits in
development as well as in adult stages and neurodegenerative diseases.

Following the astonishing molecular diversity of voltage-gated ion channels that 
was revealed in the past few decades, the ion channel repertoire expressed by
neurons has been implicated as the major factor governing their functional
heterogeneity. Although the molecular structure of ion channels is a key
determinant of their biophysical properties, their subcellular distribution and
densities on the surface of nerve cells are just as important for fulfilling
functional requirements. Recent results obtained with high resolution
quantitative localization techniques revealed complex, subcellular
compartment-specific distribution patterns of distinct ion channels. Here I
suggest that within a given neuron type every ion channel has a unique cell
surface distribution pattern, with the functional consequence that this
dramatically increases the computational power of nerve cells.

Regulated neurotransmitter release from presynaptic boutons is crucial for the
functioning of chemical synapses, what in turn governs the functional performance
of the nervous system. Release occurs at the active zone (AZ), a specialized
region of the presynaptic plasma membrane that is defined by a unique and complex
meshwork of proteins--the cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ). Important functions of CAZ 
proteins include recruitment, docking and priming of synaptic vesicles as well as
appropriate localization of voltage-gated calcium channels near vesicle docking
sites. We will discuss recent progress in the understanding of the topological
localization and the molecular functions of characteristic CAZ proteins as well
as emerging molecular mechanisms underlying presynaptic plasticity that involve
significant structural CAZ remodeling.

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) linked to cytoskeleton generate stable cell-cell
junctions. Cadherins provide a canonical example, but paradoxically, they
participate in a multitude of transient and regulatable interactions. Their
extracellular binding generates weak adhesion that is modified by clustering;
interactions with F-actin are regulated, can be transient, and can alter F-actin 
dynamics. Additionally, cadherin recycling from the cell surface can modify the
size and location of junctions and strength of adhesion. In epithelial cells,
this ongoing dynamic behavior is important for maintaining stable junctions.
Recent work supports that cadherins act similarly at synapses where their actions
are likely to be shared by integrins and other actin-linked CAMs. Together the
collaborative activities of such CAMs provide a stable, but flexible structure
that can promote and support changes in synapse shape and size while maintaining 
stable junctions to permit information flow.

In the mammalian central nervous system, the majority of fast excitatory synaptic
transmission is mediated by glutamate acting on AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate
receptors. The abundance of AMPA receptors at the synapse can be modulated
through receptor trafficking, which dynamically regulates many fundamental brain 
functions, including learning and memory. Reversible posttranslational
modifications, including phosphorylation, palmitoylation and ubiquitination of
AMPA receptor subunits are important regulatory mechanisms for controlling
synaptic AMPA receptor expression and function. In this review, we highlight
recent advances in the study of AMPA receptor posttranslational modifications and
discuss how these modifications regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and function
at synapses.

The search for genetic causes of intellectual disability has identified, over the
past twenty years, numerous mutated genes that code for proteins concerned with
synapse function. Functional studies have shown that these genes may be involved 
in synapse formation, the synthesis and degradation of specific synapse proteins,
the regulation of dendritic spine morphology, or regulation of the synaptic
cytoskeleton. It is now clear that even mild alterations in synapse morphology
and function can give rise to intellectual disability, and pharmacological agents
able to counteract these morphological and functional anomalies--and improve the 
symptoms of some of these conditions--now appear feasible. This paper reviews
recent findings on the functions of some of the genes responsible for
intellectual disability syndromes.

Exposure to addictive drugs causes changes in synaptic function within the
striatal complex, which can either mimic or interfere with the induction of
synaptic plasticity. These synaptic adaptations include changes in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a ventral striatal subregion important for drug reward and
reinforcement, as well as the dorsal striatum, which may promote habitual drug
use. As the behavioral effects of drugs of abuse are long-lasting, identifying
persistent changes in striatal circuits induced by in vivo drug experience is of 
considerable importance. Within the striatum, drugs of abuse have been shown to
induce modifications in dendritic morphology, ionotropic glutamate receptors
(iGluR) and the induction of synaptic plasticity. Understanding the detailed
molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in striatal circuit function will
provide insight into how drugs of abuse usurp normal learning mechanisms to
produce pathological behavior.

At excitatory synapses in the brain, glutamate released from nerve terminals
binds to glutamate receptors to mediate signaling between neurons. Glutamate
receptors expressed in heterologous cells show ion channel activity. Recently,
native glutamate receptors were shown to contain auxiliary subunits that modulate
the trafficking and/or channel properties. The AMPA receptor (AMPAR) can contain 
TARP and CNIHs as the auxiliary subunits, whereas kainate receptor (KAR) can
contain the Neto auxiliary subunit. Each of these auxiliary subunits uniquely
modulates the glutamate receptors, and determines properties of native glutamate 
receptors. A thorough elucidation of the properties of native glutamate receptor 
complexes is indispensable for the understanding of the molecular machinery that 
regulates glutamate receptors and excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain.

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity remains an enigmatic form of synaptic plasticity.
Increasing interest on the topic has fuelled a surge of recent studies that have 
identified key molecular players and the signaling pathways involved. However,
the new findings also highlight our lack of knowledge concerning some of the
basic properties of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. In this review we address
how homeostatic mechanisms balance synaptic strengths between the presynaptic and
the postsynaptic terminals and across synapses that share the same postsynaptic
neuron.

Dendritic spines are small mushroom-like protrusions arising from neurons where
most excitatory synapses reside. Their peculiar shape suggests that spines can
serve as an autonomous postsynaptic compartment that isolates chemical and
electrical signaling. How neuronal activity modifies the morphology of the spine 
and how these modifications affect synaptic transmission and plasticity are
intriguing issues. Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or
depression (LTD) is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine,
respectively. This structural plasticity is mainly controlled by actin filaments,
the principal cytoskeletal component of the spine. Here we review the pioneering 
microscopic studies examining the structural plasticity of spines and propose how
changes in actin treadmilling might regulate spine morphology.

Since the initial findings that NMDA receptors play important roles in cellular
models of learning as well as neurotoxicity, abnormal function of this receptor
has been considered a potential mechanism in the pathophysiology underlying
Alzheimer's disease. Treatment of Alzheimer's disease with an NMDA receptor
antagonist began several years ago, with some limited success. More recent
mechanistic studies have examined the role of NMDA receptors in the synaptic
effects of beta amyloid (Aβ).

The magnetic retina: light-dependent and trigeminal magnetoreception in migratory

Recent advances have brought much new insight into the physiological mechanisms
and required characteristics of the sensory molecules that enable birds to use
magnetic fields for orientation. European robins almost certainly have two
magnetodetection senses, one associated with the ophthalmic branch of the
trigeminal nerve, and one based on light-dependent radical-pair processes in both
eyes. The first brain areas processing magnetic information from each of these
two senses have been identified. It has been experimentally verified that
Earth-strength magnetic fields can affect photo-induced chemical reactions and
that these reactions can respond to magnetic field direction. Diagnostic
behavioural experiments have provided clues to identify putative magnetoreceptive
molecules in the retina. We discuss the implications of these and other recent
findings and outline crucial open questions with an emphasis on the
light-dependent mechanism.

Bats use a neuronally implemented computational acoustic model to form sonar
images.

USA. james_simmons@brown.edu

This paper reexamines neurophysiological results from echolocating big brown bats
to propose a new perspective on FM biosonar processing in the auditory system.
Individual auditory neurons are frequency-tuned and respond to brief, 2-10 ms FM 
sweeps with an average of one spike per sound to register their tuned
frequencies, to detect echo arrival, or to register a local null in the echo
spectrum. When initiated by the broadcast, these responses comprise a cascade of 
single spikes distributed across time in neurons tuned to different frequencies
that persists for 30-50 ms, long after the sound has ended. Their progress
mirrors the broadcast's propagation away from the bat and the return of echoes
for distances out to 5-8 m. Each returning echo evokes a similar pattern of
single spikes that coincide with ongoing responses to the broadcast to register
the target's distance and shape. The hypothesis advanced here is that this flow
of responses over time acts as an internal model of sonar acoustics that the bat 
executes using neuronal computations distributed across many neurons to
accumulate a dynamic image of the bat's surroundings.

United States.

Natural olfactory stimuli typically are mixtures of which the identities,
concentrations, and ratios of chemical constituents are important for many
odor-mediated behaviors. Despite abundant behavioral examples, links between
odor-evoked behavior and the processing and discrimination of complex olfactory
stimuli remains an area of active study. Coupling electrophysiological and
behavioral experiments, recent studies in a variety of different insect models
have provided new insights into the perceptual and neural mechanisms about how
natural olfactory stimuli are processed, and how plasticity and internal state of
the insect may influence the odor representation. These studies show that complex
stimuli are represented in unique percepts that are different from their
individual constituents, and that the representation may be modulated by
experience and influenced by other sensory modalities.

Sound source perception refers to the auditory system's ability to parse incoming
sensory information into coherent representations of distinct sound sources in
the environment. Such abilities are no doubt key to successful communication in
many taxa, but we know little about their function in animal communication
systems. For anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), social and reproductive
behaviors depend on a listener's ability to hear and identify sound signals amid 
high levels of background noise in acoustically cluttered environments. Recent
neuroethological studies are revealing how frogs parse these complex acoustic
scenes to identify individual calls in noisy breeding choruses. Current evidence 
highlights some interesting similarities and differences in how the auditory
systems of frogs and other vertebrates (most notably birds and mammals) perform
auditory scene analysis.

The advancing development of tracking techniques has led to fascinating new
insights into avian migration, documenting the immense diversity, complexity, and
flexibility of this phenomenon. Tracking studies so far have confirmed many
findings from ringing recoveries and cage studies, for example, the change from
flying innate compass courses in the first migration to true navigation, as
experienced migrants head toward familiar goals. First attempts to analyze the
navigational mechanisms by tracking manipulated migrants indicate strong
parallels to those of homing pigeons. Findings suggesting that the magnetic
compass of migrants is regularly calibrated by the pattern of polarized light
could not be replicated with a number of other birds, pointing out differences
between species and possibly region and phases of migration. Tracking has become 
a valuable tool, complimenting traditional methods by documenting migration
behavior in the wild; whether it can be used to further unveil the navigational
mechanisms of migrants and the factor used remains an open question.

Neural specializations for small target detection in insects.

Despite being equipped with low-resolution eyes and tiny brains, many insects
show exquisite abilities to detect and pursue targets even in highly textured
surrounds. Target tracking behavior is subserved by neurons that are sharply
tuned to the motion of small high-contrast targets. These neurons respond
robustly to target motion, even against self-generated optic flow. A recent
model, supported by neurophysiology, generates target selectivity by being
sharply tuned to the unique spatiotemporal profile associated with target motion.
Target neurons are likely connected in a complex network where some provide more 
direct output to behavior, whereas others serve an inter-regulatory role. These
interactions may regulate attention and aid in the robust detection of targets in
clutter observed in behavior.

Sequence learning and the role of the hippocampus in rodent navigation.

The hippocampus has long been associated with navigation and spatial
representations, but it has been difficult to link directly the
neurophysiological correlates of hippocampal place cells with navigational
planning and action. In recent years, large-scale population recordings of place 
cells have revealed that spatial sequences are stored and activated in ways that 
may support navigational strategies. Plasticity mechanisms allow the hippocampus 
to store learned sequences of locations that may allow predictions of future
locations based on past experience. These sequences can also be activated during 
navigational behavior in ways that may allow the animal to learn trajectories
toward goals. Task-dependent alterations in place cell firing patterns may
reflect the operation of the hippocampus in associating locations with
navigationally relevant decision variables.

Escape behaviors in insects.

Escape behaviors are, by necessity, fast and robust, making them excellent
systems with which to study the neural basis of behavior. This is especially true
in insects, which have comparatively tractable nervous systems and members who
are amenable to manipulation with genetic tools. Recent technical developments in
high-speed video reveal that, despite their short duration, insect escape
behaviors are more complex than previously appreciated. For example, before
initiating an escape jump, a fly performs sophisticated posture and
stimulus-dependent preparatory leg movements that enable it to jump away from a
looming threat. This newfound flexibility raises the question of how the nervous 
system generates a behavior that is both rapid and flexible. Recordings from the 
cricket nervous system suggest that synchrony between the activity of specific
interneuron pairs may provide a rapid cue for the cricket to detect the direction
of an approaching predator and thus which direction it should run. Technical
advances make possible wireless recording from neurons while locusts escape from 
a looming threat, enabling, for the first time, a direct correlation between the 
activity of multiple neurons and the time-course of an insect escape behavior.

School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.

Escape behaviors are crucial to survive predator encounters. Touch to the head of
Caenorhabditis elegans induces an escape response where the animal rapidly backs 
away from the stimulus and suppresses foraging head movements. The coordination
of head and body movements facilitates escape from predacious fungi that
cohabitate with nematodes in organic debris. An appreciation of the natural
habitat of laboratory organisms, like C. elegans, enables a comprehensive
neuroethological analysis of behavior. In this review we discuss the neuronal
mechanisms and the ecological significance of the C. elegans touch response.

Echolocating bats detect prey using ultrasonic pulses, and many nocturnally
flying insects effectively detect and evade these predators through sensitive
ultrasonic hearing. Many eared insects can use the intensity of the
predator-generated ultrasound and the stereotyped progression of bat echolocation
pulse rate to assess risk level. Effective responses can vary from gentle turns
away from the threat (low risk) to sudden random flight and dives (highest risk).
Recent research with eared moths shows that males will balance immediate bat
predation risk against reproductive opportunity as judged by the strength and
quality of conspecific pheromones present. Ultrasound exposure may, in fact, bias
such decisions for up to 24 hours through plasticity in the CNS olfactory system.
However, brain processing of ultrasonic stimuli to yield adaptive prey behaviors 
remains largely unstudied, so possible mechanisms are not known.

Smelling on the fly: sensory cues and strategies for olfactory navigation in
Drosophila.

Navigating toward (or away from) a remote odor source is a challenging problem
that requires integrating olfactory information with visual and mechanosensory
cues. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful organism for studying the neural
mechanisms of these navigation behaviors. There are a wealth of genetic tools in 
this organism, as well as a history of inventive behavioral experiments. There is
also a large and growing literature in Drosophila on the neural coding of
olfactory, visual, and mechanosensory stimuli. Here we review recent progress in 
understanding how these stimulus modalities are encoded in the Drosophila nervous
system. We also discuss what strategies a fly might use to navigate in a natural 
olfactory landscape while making use of all these sources of sensory information.
We emphasize that Drosophila are likely to switch between multiple strategies for
olfactory navigation, depending on the availability of various sensory cues.
Finally, we highlight future research directions that will be important in
understanding the neural circuits that underlie these behaviors.

The ability to learn the location of places in the world and to revisit them
repeatedly is crucial for all aspects of animal life on earth. It underpins
animal foraging, predator avoidance, territoriality, mating, nest construction
and parental care. Much theoretical and experimental progress has recently been
made in identifying the sensory cues and the computational mechanisms that allow 
insects (and robots) to find their way back to places, while the neurobiological 
mechanisms underlying navigational abilities are beginning to be unravelled in
vertebrate and invertebrate models. Studying visual homing in insects is
interesting, because they allow experimentation and view-reconstruction under
natural conditions, because they are likely to have evolved parsimonious, yet
robust solutions to the homing problem and because they force us to consider the 
viewpoint of navigating animals, including their sensory and computational
capacities.

The many facets of facial interactions in mammals.

Facial interactions are prominent behaviors in primates. Primate facial
signaling, which includes the expression of emotions, mimicking of facial
movements, and gaze interactions, is visually dominated. Correspondingly, in
primate brains an elaborate network of face processing areas exists within visual
cortex. But other mammals also communicate through facial interactions using
additional sensory modalities. In rodents, multisensory facial interactions are
involved in aggressive behaviors and social transmission of food preferences. The
eusocial naked mole-rat, whose face is dominated by prominent incisors, uses
facial aggression to enforce reproductive suppression. In burrow-living mammals
like the naked mole-rat in particular, and in rodents in general, somatosensory
face representations in cortex are enlarged. Diversity of sensory domains
mediating facial communication might belie underlying common mechanisms. As a
case in point, neurogenetics has revealed strongly heritable traits in face
processing and identified gene defects that disrupt facial interactions both in
humans and rodents.

prey. Here I describe and discuss the whiskers of carnivorous grasshopper mice
and shrews, the sensory rays of the star-nosed mole, and the tactile appendages
of the tentacled snake. These diverse sensors are accompanied by remarkable
corresponding specializations in the central nervous system. But understanding
their function and the significance of the central nervous system correlates
requires the careful documentation of behavior inherent to a neuroethological
approach.

Decision-making networks must be tuned according to the rules that govern which
action will be rewarded for a given constellation of current sensory information.
Somehow these rules must be implemented in the networks that translate the
sensory cues to actions but the nature of this representation is enigmatic.
Recent findings suggest that Mauthner-associated networks in some fish can govern
surprisingly sophisticated and plastic decisions in which the rules of prey
motion govern what speed and direction must be selected to be at the right point 
at the right time. With the key cellular players individually identifiable, fish 
can help us to discover the nature of how rules are represented in
decision-making circuitry of the vertebrate brain.

Interacting with a moving object poses a computational problem for an animal's
nervous system. This problem has been elegantly solved by the dragonfly, a
formidable visual predator on flying insects. The dragonfly computes an
interception flight trajectory and steers to maintain it during its prey-pursuit 
flight. This review summarizes current knowledge about pursuit behavior and
neurons thought to control interception in the dragonfly. When understood, this
system has the potential for explaining how a small group of neurons can control 
complex interactions with moving objects.

Sniffing and whisking are two rhythmic orofacial motor activities that enable
rodents to localize and track objects in their environment. They have related
temporal dynamics, possibly as a result of both shared musculature and shared
sensory tasks. Sniffing and whisking also constitute the overt expression of an
animal's anticipation of a reward. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms that underlie the
control of these behaviors have not been established. Here, we review the
similarities between sniffing and whisking and suggest that such similarities
indicate a mechanistic link between these two rhythmic exploratory behaviors.

The neuroethology of escape in crabs: from sensory ecology to neurons and back.

A major challenge in neurobiology is to understand how brains function in animals
behaving in the complexity of their natural environment. Progress will depend on 
our ability to correctly interpret results from laboratory experiments in the
light of information processing demands identified by studying the organization
of behaviour and the flow of information in naturally behaving animals. Predator 
avoidance responses of semi-terrestrial crabs offer an excellent opportunity for 
such an approach. We review here findings from two distinct lines of research:
(1) Field studies which have characterized the structure and context of escape
behaviour to real and dummy predators, and (2) Laboratory studies which have used
computer-simulated images and in vivo intracellular recordings to identify and
characterize individual neurons implicated in the control of escape. The results 
of both approaches highlight the influence of behavioural and environmental
context in structuring escape. In order to understand how context and the complex
flow of signals are processed and translated into behaviour in natural
environments it is imperative that future studies take electrophysiology
outdoors.

The fruit fly Drosophila larva demonstrates a sophisticated repertoire of
behavior under the control of a numerically simple neural system. Historically,
the stereotyped responses of larvae to light and odors captivated the attention
of biologists. More recently, the sensory receptors responsible for
chemosensation, thermosensation, and vision have been identified. While our
understanding of the molecular logic of perception has clearly progressed, little
is known about the neural and computational mechanisms guiding movement in
sensory gradients. Here we review evidence that larvae orient based on active
sensation-a feature distinct from the strategies used by simpler model organisms.
Reorientation maneuvers are controlled by the spatiotemporal integration of
changes in stimulus intensity detected during runs and lateral head movements.

Long-distance migration is a strategy some animals use to survive a seasonally
changing environment. To reach favorable grounds, migratory animals have evolved 
sophisticated navigational mechanisms that rely on a map and compasses. In
migratory insects, the existence of a map sense (sense of position) remains
poorly understood, but recent work has provided new insights into the mechanisms 
some compasses use for maintaining a constant bearing during long-distance
navigation. The best-studied directional strategy relies on a time-compensated
sun compass, used by diurnal insects, for which neural circuits have begun to be 
delineated. Yet, a growing body of evidence suggests that migratory insects may
also rely on other compasses that use night sky cues or the Earth's magnetic
field. Those mechanisms are ripe for exploration.

The role of auditory feedback in vocal learning and maintenance.

27710, USA.

Auditory experience is critical for the acquisition and maintenance of learned
vocalizations in both humans and songbirds. Despite the central role of auditory 
feedback in vocal learning and maintenance, where and how auditory feedback
affects neural circuits important to vocal control remain poorly understood.
Recent studies of singing birds have uncovered neural mechanisms by which
feedback perturbations affect vocal plasticity and also have identified
feedback-sensitive neurons at or near sites of auditory and vocal motor
interaction. Additionally, recent studies in marmosets have underscored that even
in the absence of vocal learning, vocalization remains flexible in the face of
changing acoustical environments, pointing to rapid interactions between auditory
and vocal motor systems. Finally, recent studies show that a juvenile songbird's 
initial auditory experience of a song model has long-lasting effects on
sensorimotor neurons important to vocalization, shedding light on how auditory
memories and feedback interact to guide vocal learning.

The magnetic map of hatchling loggerhead sea turtles.

United States.

Young loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from eastern Florida, U.S.A.,
undertake a transoceanic migration in which they gradually circle the North
Atlantic Ocean before returning to the North American coast. Hatchlings in the
open sea are guided at least partly by a 'magnetic map' in which regional
magnetic fields function as navigational markers and elicit changes in swimming
direction at crucial locations along the migratory route. The magnetic map exists
in turtles that have never migrated and thus appears to be inherited. Turtles
derive both longitudinal and latitudinal information from the Earth's field, most
likely by exploiting unique combinations of field inclination and intensity that 
occur in different geographic areas. Similar mechanisms may function in the
migrations of diverse animals.

Just follow your nose: homing by olfactory cues in ants.

How is an ant-equipped with a brain that barely exceeds the size of a
pinhead-capable of achieving navigational marvels? Even though evidences suggest 
that navigation is a multimodal process, ants heavily depend on olfactory cues-of
pheromonal and non-pheromonal nature-for foraging and orientation. Recent studies
have directed their attention to the efficiency of pheromone trail networks.
Advances in neurophysiological techniques make it possible to investigate trail
pheromone processing in the ant's brain. In addition to relying on pheromone
odours, ants also make use of volatiles emanating from the nest surroundings.
Deposited in the vicinity of the nest, these home-range markings help the ants to
home after a foraging run. Furthermore, olfactory landmarks associated with the
nest enhance ants' homing abilities.

Physiologie, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

Chemical sensory signals play a crucial role in eliciting motor behaviors. We now
review the different motor behaviors induced by chemosensory stimuli in fish as
well as their neural substrate. A great deal of research has focused on
migratory, reproductive, foraging, and escape behaviors but it is only recently
that the molecules mediating these chemotactic responses have become
well-characterized. Chemotactic responses are mediated by three sensory systems: 
olfactory, gustatory, and diffuse chemosensory. The olfactory sensory neuron
responses to chemicals are now better understood. In addition, the olfactory
projections to the central nervous system were recently shown to display an
odotopic organization in the forebrain. Moreover, a specific downward projection 
underlying motor responses to olfactory inputs was recently described.

Uncovering the relationships between animal behavior and cellular activity in the
brain has been one of the key aims of neuroscience research for decades, and
still remains so. Electrophysiological approaches have enabled sparse sampling
from electrically excitable cells in freely moving animals that has led to the
identification of important phenomena such as place, grid and head-direction
cells. Optical imaging in combination with newly developed labeling approaches
now allows minimally invasive and comprehensive sampling from dense networks of
electrically and chemically excitable cells such as neurons and glia during
self-determined behavior. To achieve this two main imaging avenues have been
followed: Optical recordings in head-restrained, mobile animals and miniature
microscope-bearing freely moving animals. Here we review progress made toward
functional cellular imaging in freely moving rodents, focusing on developments
over the past few years. We discuss related challenges and biological
applications.

Understanding the brain will require unraveling its synaptic circuitry, but
methods that can reliably identify connected neurons are often excruciatingly
slow. Although light microscopy can provide much higher throughput, synapses are 
smaller than the diffraction limit and cannot readily be assigned to particular
presynaptic and postsynaptic cells without specialized labeling methods. Here we 
review the ongoing development of techniques that allow direct imaging of neural 
networks by specifically marking connected cells or their synapses.

The connectivity architecture of neuronal circuits is essential to understand how
brains work, yet our knowledge about the neuronal wiring diagrams remains limited
and partial. Technical breakthroughs in labeling and imaging methods starting
more than a century ago have advanced knowledge in the field. However, the volume
of data associated with imaging a whole brain or a significant fraction thereof, 
with electron or light microscopy, has only recently become amenable to digital
storage and analysis. A mouse brain imaged at light-microscopic resolution is
about a terabyte of data, and 1mm(3) of the brain at EM resolution is about half 
a petabyte. This has given rise to a new field of research, computational
analysis of large-scale neuroanatomical data sets, with goals that include
reconstructions of the morphology of individual neurons as well as entire
circuits. The problems encountered include large data management, segmentation
and 3D reconstruction, computational geometry and workflow management allowing
for hybrid approaches combining manual and algorithmic processing. Here we review
this growing field of neuronal data analysis with emphasis on reconstructing
neurons from EM data cubes.

Optogenetics has been revolutionizing circuit neuroscience in the last few years.
Optical methods combined with genetics and molecular techniques have provided new
tools for stimulation of neurons, which hold great promise to provide a solution 
to the circuit mapping problem and more generally provide us with the ability to 
artificially control the natural stimulus space. Nevertheless, until very
recently almost all applications of optogenetics have been based on relatively
simple optical schemes mainly used for inducing population activity in neuronal
assembles. In this context, alternative optical schemes that enhance the spatial 
or temporal resolution of excitation and allow for flexible and arbitrary
generation of light patterns have all synergetic impact on the development of new
optogenetic actuators. In the following we discuss and compare the main new
optical techniques that have become available in the recent years. Their
respective strengths and limitations as well as their application to different
biological contexts are illustrated.

Virtual reality (VR) holds great promise as a tool to study the neural circuitry 
underlying animal behaviors. Here, we discuss the advantages of VR and the
experimental paradigms and technologies that enable closed loop behavioral
experiments. We review recent results from VR research in genetic model organisms
where the potential combination of rich behaviors, genetic tools and cutting edge
neural recording techniques are leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of 
the neural basis of behavior. We also discuss several key issues to consider when
performing VR experiments and provide an outlook for the future of this exciting 
experimental toolkit.

nature have enabled labeling of individual neurons to study their physiology and

The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the number of tools to acquire
volume electron microscopy (EM) data. Several new scanning EM (SEM) imaging
methods have emerged, and classical transmission EM (TEM) methods are being
scaled up and automated. Here we summarize the new methods for acquiring large EM
volumes, and discuss the tradeoffs in terms of resolution, acquisition speed, and
reliability. We then assess each method's applicability to the problem of
reconstructing anatomical connectivity between neurons, considering both the
current capabilities and future prospects of the method. Finally, we argue that
neuronal 'wiring diagrams' are likely necessary, but not sufficient, to
understand the operation of most neuronal circuits: volume EM imaging will likely
find its best application in combination with other methods in neuroscience, such
as molecular biology, optogenetics, and physiology.

In recent years, interest has grown in the ability to manipulate, in a temporally
precise fashion, the electrical activity of specific neurons embedded within
densely wired brain circuits, in order to reveal how specific neurons subserve
behaviors and neural computations, and to open up new horizons on the clinical
treatment of brain disorders. Technologies that enable temporally precise control
of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons'
neighbors-whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of
nanometers away-must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a
transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control.
Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific
neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering
energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to
activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic
tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity
downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the
principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely
used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement
of these toolboxes.

Tethering genetically encoded peptide toxins or ligands close to their point of
activity at the cell plasma membrane provides a new approach to the study of cell
networks and neuronal circuits, as it allows selective targeting of specific cell
populations, enhances the working concentration of the ligand or blocker peptide,
and permits the engineering of a large variety of t-peptides (e.g., including use
of fluorescent markers, viral vectors and point mutation variants). This review
describes the development of tethered toxins (t-toxins) and peptides derived from
the identification of the cell surface nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
modulator lynx1, the existence of related endogenous cell surface modulators of
nAChR and AMPA receptors, and the application of the t-toxin and t-neuropeptide
technology to the dissection of neuronal circuits in metazoans.

Genetics' demand for increased throughput is driving automatization of behavior
analysis far beyond experimental workhorses like circadian monitors and the
operant conditioning box. However, the new automation is not just faster: it is
also allowing new kinds of experiments, many of which erase the boundaries of the
traditional neuroscience disciplines (psychology, ethology and physiology) while 
producing insight into problems that were otherwise opaque. Ironically, a central
theme of current automatization is to improve observation of animals in
increasingly naturalistic environments. This is not just a return to 19th century
priorities: the new observational methods provide unprecedented quantitation of
actions and ever-closer integration with experimentation.

The past few decades have seen the field of genetic engineering evolve at a rapid
pace, with neuroscientists now equipped with a wide range of tools for the
manipulation of an animal's genome in order to study brain function. However, the
number of species to which these technologies have been applied, namely the fruit
fly, C. elegans, zebrafish and mouse, remains relatively few. This review will
discuss the variety of approaches to genetic modification that have been
developed in such traditional 'genetic systems', and highlight the progress that 
has been made to translate these technologies to alternative species such as
rats, monkeys and birds, where certain neurobiological questions may be better
studied.

Recording activity from identified populations of neurons is a central goal of
neuroscience. Changes in membrane depolarization, particularly action potentials,
are the most important features of neural physiology to extract, although ions,
neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, second messengers, and the activation state
of specific proteins are also crucial. Modern fluorescence microscopy provides
the basis for such activity mapping, through multi-photon imaging and other
optical schemes. Probes remain the rate-limiting step for progress in this field:
they should be bright and photostable, and ideally come in multiple colors. Only 
protein-based reagents permit chronic imaging from genetically specified cells.
Here we review recent progress in the design, optimization and deployment of
genetically encoded indicators for calcium ions (a proxy for action potentials),

The controlled cutting of tissue with laser light is a natural technology to
combine with automated stereotaxic surgery. A central challenge is to cut hard
tissue, such as bone, without inducing damage to juxtaposed soft tissue, such as 
nerve and dura. We review past work that demonstrates the feasibility of such
control through the use of ultrafast laser light to both cut and generate optical
feedback signals via second harmonic generation and laser induced plasma spectra.

Electrophysiological recordings from behaving animals provide an unparalleled
view into the functional role of individual neurons. Intracellular approaches can
be especially revealing as they provide information about a neuron's inputs and
intrinsic cellular properties, which together determine its spiking output.
Recent technical developments have made intracellular recording possible during
an ever-increasing range of behaviors in both head-fixed and freely moving
animals. These recordings have yielded fundamental insights into the cellular and
circuit mechanisms underlying neural activity during natural behaviors in such
areas as sensory perception, motor sequence generation, and spatial navigation,
forging a direct link between cellular and systems neuroscience.

Understanding the highly plastic nature of neurons requires the dynamic
visualization of their molecular and cellular organization in a native context.
However, due to the limited resolution of standard light microscopy, many of the 
structural specializations of neurons cannot be resolved. A recent revolution in 
light microscopy has given rise to several super-resolution light microscopy
methods yielding 2-10-fold higher resolution than conventional microscopy. We
here describe the principles behind these techniques as well as their application
to the analysis of the molecular architecture of the synapse. Furthermore, we
discuss the potential for continued development of super-resolution microscopy as
necessary for live imaging of neuronal structure and function in the brain.

Sparse, random labelling of individual cells is a key approach to study brain
circuit organisation and development. An array of methods based on genetic
engineering now complements older methods such as Golgi staining, facilitating
analysis while providing higher information content. Increasingly refined
expression strategies based on transcriptional modulators and site-specific
recombinases are used to distribute markers or combinations of markers within
specific neuronal subsets. Several trends are emerging: first, increasing
labelling density with multiplexed markers to allow more cells to be reliably
distinguished; second, using labels to report lineage relationships among defined
cells in addition to anatomy; third, coupling cell labelling with genetic
manipulations that reveal or perturb cell function. These strategies offer new
opportunities for characterizing the fine scale architecture of neuronal
circuits, and understanding lineage and functional relations among their cellular
components in normal or experimental situations.

The new generation of silicon-based multielectrodes comprising hundreds or more
electrode contacts offers unprecedented possibilities for simultaneous recordings
of spike trains from thousands of neurons. Such data will not only be invaluable 
for finding out how neural networks in the brain work, but will likely be
important also for neural prosthesis applications. This opportunity can only be
realized if efficient, accurate and validated methods for automatic spike sorting
are provided. In this review we describe some of the challenges that must be met 
to achieve this goal, and in particular argue for the critical need of realistic 
model data to be used as ground truth in the validation of spike-sorting
algorithms.

The rapid accumulation of neuroproteomics data in recent years has prompted the
emergence of novel antibody-based imaging methods that aim to understand the
anatomical and functional context of the multitude of identified proteins. The
pioneering field of ultrastructural multiplexed proteomic imaging now includes a 
number of high resolution methods, such as array tomography, stimulated emission 
depletion microscopy, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy and automated 
transmission electron microscopy, which allow a detailed molecular
characterization of individual synapses and subsynaptic structures within brain
tissues for the first time. While all of these methods still face considerable
limitations, a combined complementary approach building on the respective
strengths of each method is possible and will enable fascinating research into
the proteomic diversity of the nervous system.

Light sheet microscopy is a versatile imaging technique with a unique combination
of capabilities. It provides high imaging speed, high signal-to-noise ratio and
low levels of photobleaching and phototoxic effects. These properties are crucial
in a wide range of applications in the life sciences, from live imaging of fast
dynamic processes in single cells to long-term observation of developmental
dynamics in entire large organisms. When combined with tissue clearing methods,
light sheet microscopy furthermore allows rapid imaging of large specimens with
excellent coverage and high spatial resolution. Even samples up to the size of
entire mammalian brains can be efficiently recorded and quantitatively analyzed. 
Here, we provide an overview of the history of light sheet microscopy, review the
development of tissue clearing methods, and discuss recent technical
breakthroughs that have the potential to influence the future direction of the
field.

Recent advances in non-invasive neuroimaging have enabled the measurement of
connections between distant regions in the living human brain, thus opening up a 
new field of research: Human connectomics. Different imaging modalities allow the
mapping of structural connections (axonal fibre tracts) as well as functional
connections (correlations in time series), and individual variations in these
connections may be related to individual variations in behaviour and cognition.
Connectivity analysis has already led to a number of new insights about brain
organization. For example, segregated brain regions may be identified by their
unique patterns of connectivity, structural and functional connectivity may be
compared to elucidate how dynamic interactions arise from the anatomical
substrate, and the architecture of large-scale networks connecting sets of brain 
regions may be analysed in detail. The combined analysis of structural and
functional networks has begun to reveal components or modules with distinct
patterns of connections that become engaged in different cognitive tasks.
Collectively, advances in human connectomics open up the possibility of studying 
how brain connections mediate regional brain function and thence behaviour.

This review is focused on specific circuits of the medial temporal lobe that have
become better understood in recent years for their computational properties
contributing to episodic memory and to memory impairment associated with aging
and other risk for AD. The layer II neurons in the entorhinal cortex and their
targets in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of hippocampus comprise a system that
rapidly encodes representations that are distinct from prior memories. Frank
neuron loss in the entorhinal cortex is specific for AD, and related structural
and functional changes across the network comprised of the entorhinal cortex and 
the dentate/CA3 regions hold promise for predicting progression on the path to
AD.

Pain and itch: insights into the neural circuits of aversive somatosensation in
health and disease.

Ross SE(1).

Author information:

Research, Pittsburgh, PA 05213, USA. saross@pitt.edu

Although pain and itch are distinct sensations, most noxious chemicals are not
very specific to one sensation over the other, and recent discoveries are
revealing that Trp channels function as transducers for both. A key difference
between these sensations is that itch is initiated by irritation of the skin,
whereas pain can be elicited from almost anywhere in the body; thus, itch may be 
encoded by the selective activation of specific subsets of neurons that are tuned
to detect harmful stimuli at the surface and have specialized central
connectivity that is specific to itch. Within the spinal cord, cross-modal
inhibition between pain and itch may help sharpen the distinction between these
sensations. Moreover, this idea that somatosensory modalities inhibit one another
may be generalizable to other somatosensory subtypes, such as cold and hot.
Importantly, just as there are inhibitory circuits in the dorsal horn that
mediate cross-inhibition between modalities, it appears that there are also
excitatory connections that can be unmasked upon injury or in disease, leading to
abnormally elevated pain states such as allodynia. We are now beginning to
understand some of this dorsal horn circuitry, and these discoveries are proving 
to be relevant for pathological conditions of chronic pain and itch.

Mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in Parkinson's disease: disordered cellular 
power plant becomes a big deal in a major movement disorder.

Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, is characterized by 
age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the
mid-brain. Non-motor symptoms of PD, however, precede the motor features caused
by dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, suggesting that PD is a systemic
disorder. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been observed in PD patients and
animal models, but the mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and PD 
pathogenesis is not well understood. Recent studies have revealed that genes
associated with autosomal recessive forms of PD such as PINK1 and Parkin are
directly involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology and maintenance,
abnormality of which is also observed in the more common, sporadic forms of PD,
although the autosomal recessive PDs lack Lewy-body pathology that is
characteristic of sporadic PD. These latest findings suggest that at least some
forms of PD can be characterized as a mitochondrial disorder. Whether
mitochondrial dysfunction represents a unifying pathogenic mechanism of all PD
cases remains a major unresolved question.

Obesity is on the rise in all developed countries, and a large part of this
epidemic has been attributed to excess caloric intake, induced by ever present
food cues and the easy availability of energy dense foods in an environment of
plenty. Clearly, there are strong homeostatic regulatory mechanisms keeping body 
weight of many individuals exposed to this environment remarkably stable over
their adult life. Other individuals, however, seem to eat not only because of
metabolic need, but also because of excessive hedonic drive to make them feel
better and relieve stress. In the extreme, some individuals exhibit
addiction-like behavior toward food, and parallels have been drawn to drug and
alcohol addiction. However, there is an important distinction in that, unlike
drugs and alcohol, food is a daily necessity. Considerable advances have been
made recently in the identification of neural circuits that represent the
interface between the metabolic and hedonic drives of eating. We will cover these
new findings by focusing first on the capacity of metabolic signals to modulate
processing of cognitive and reward functions in cortico-limbic systems
(bottom-up) and then on pathways by which the cognitive and emotional brain may
override homeostatic regulation (top-down).

Narcolepsy with hypocretin/orexin deficiency, infections and autoimmunity of the 
brain.

Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.

The loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (hcrt) producing neurons causes
narcolepsy with cataplexy. An autoimmune basis for the disease has long been
suspected and recent results have greatly strengthened this hypothesis.
Narcolepsy with hcrt deficiency is now known to be associated with a Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and T-cell receptor (TCR) polymorphisms, suggesting that 
an autoimmune process targets a single peptide unique to hcrt-cells via specific 
HLA-peptide-TCR interactions. Recent data have shown a robust seasonality of
disease onset in children and associations with Streptococcus Pyogenes, and
influenza A H1N1-infection and H1N1-vaccination, pointing towards processes such 
as molecular mimicry or bystander activation as crucial for disease development. 
We speculate that upper airway infections may be common precipitants of a whole
host of CNS autoimmune complications including narcolepsy.

Apolipoprotein E isoforms and regulation of the innate immune response in brain
of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Author information:

The largest genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) resides at the
apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) locus, which has three common alleles (ɛ2, ɛ3, ɛ4)
that encode three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, apoE4). The very strong association of 
the APOE ɛ4 allele with AD risk and its role in the accumulation of amyloid β in 
brains of people and animal models solidify the biological relevance of apoE
isoforms but do not provide mechanistic insight. The innate immune response is
consistently observed in AD and is a likely contributor to neuronal injury and
response to injury. Here we review emerging data showing that apoE isoform
regulation of multiple facets of the innate immune response in the brain may
alter AD not only through amyloid β-dependent mechanisms, but also through other,
amyloid β-independent mechanisms.

Understanding the role of TDP-43 and FUS/TLS in ALS and beyond.

of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0670, United States.

Dominant mutations in two DNA/RNA binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS/TLS, are
causes of inherited Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 and FUS/TLS have 
striking structural and functional similarities, implicating alterations in RNA
processing as central in ALS. TDP-43 has binding sites within a third of all
mouse and human mRNAs in brain and this binding influences the levels and
splicing patterns of at least 20% of those mRNAs. Disease modeling in rodents of 
the first known cause of inherited ALS-mutation in the ubiquitously expressed
superoxide dismutase (SOD1)-has yielded non-cell autonomous fatal motor neuron
disease caused by one or more toxic properties acquired by the mutant proteins.
In contrast, initial disease modeling for TDP-43 and FUS/TLS has produced highly 
varied phenotypes. It remains unsettled whether TDP-43 and FUS/TLS mutants
provoke disease from a loss of function or gain of toxicity or both. TDP-43 or
FUS/TLS misaccumulation seems central not just to ALS (where it is found in
almost all instances of disease), but more broadly in neurodegenerative disease, 
including frontal temporal lobular dementia (FTLD-U) and many examples of
Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.

92697-4475, USA.

Epilepsy is the third most common brain disorder and affects millions of people. 
Epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, that is,
bursts of synchronous firing of large populations of neurons. These are believed 
to result from abnormal regulation of neuronal excitability that favors
hypersynchrony. Among the intrinsic conductances that govern neuronal
excitability, the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) plays complex and
important roles in the fine-tuning of both cellular and network activity. Not
surprisingly, dysregulation of I(h) and/or of its conducting ion-channels (HCN)
has been strongly implicated in various experimental models of epilepsy, as well 
as in human epilepsy. Here we provide an overview of recent findings on the
distinct physiological roles played by I(h) in specific contexts, and the
cellular mechanisms that underlie these functions, including the subunit make-up 
of the channels. We further discuss current knowledge of dysregulation of I(h)
and HCN channels in epilepsy in light of the multifaceted functions of I(h) in
the brain.

Patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders often exhibit a loss of
regulation of their biological rhythms which leads to altered sleep/wake cycle,
body temperature rhythm and hormonal rhythms. Whereas these symptoms have long
been considered to result from the pathology of the underlying disease,
increasing evidence now indicates that the circadian system may be more directly 
involved in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. This emerging view originated 
with the discovery that the genes involved in the generation of biological
rhythms are expressed in many brain structures where clocks function-and perhaps 
malfunction. It is also due to the interesting phenotypes of clock mutant mice.
Here we summarize recent reports showing that alteration of circadian clocks
within key brain regions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders may be an
underlying cause of the development of mental illness. We discuss how these
alterations take place at both systems and molecular levels.

Recent findings in the genetics of neurodevelopmental syndromes have ushered in
an exciting era of discovery in which substrates of neurologic dysfunction are
being identified at the synaptic and microcircuit levels in mouse models of these
disorders. We review recent progress in this area, focusing on two examples of
mouse models of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs): Mecp2 models of Rett syndrome, 
and a Met-knockout model of non-syndromic forms of autism. In both cases, a
dominant theme is changes in synaptic strength, associated with
hyper-connectivity or hypo-connectivity in specific microcircuits. Alterations in
intrinsic neuronal excitability are also found, but do not appear to be as
common. The microcircuit-specific nature of synaptic changes observed in these
ASD models indicates that it will be necessary to define mechanisms of circuit
dysfunction on a case-by-case basis, not only in neocortex but also in brainstem 
and other sub-cortical areas. Thus, functional microcircuit analysis is emerging 
as an important line of investigation, highly complementary to neurogenetic and
molecular strategies, and holds promise for generating models of the underlying
pathophysiology and for guiding development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Research, Basel, Switzerland.

Retinitis pigmentosa is a hereditary eye disease that affects photoreceptors and 
leads to blindness. The discovery of a microbial light-gated channel and the
subsequent development of similar 'optogenetic' sensors have opened the door to
creating artificial photoreceptors in the remaining retinal circuits of retinitis
pigmentosa retinas via gene therapy. Here we review recent studies in animal
models of retinitis pigmentosa that have combined knowledge of retinal cell
types, circuits and computations with the ability to equip cell types with
optogenetic sensors in order to restore visual activity. We also discuss the
translational potential of this therapy.

Deficits of cognitive control in schizophrenia are associated with altered gamma 
oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. Paralbumin basket interneurons, which
innervate the perisomatic region of pyramidal neurons, appear to play a key role 
in generating cortical gamma oscillations. In the prefrontal cortex of subjects
with schizophrenia, alterations are present in both pre- and post-synaptic
markers of the strength of GABA inputs from parvalbumin basket neurons to
pyramidal neurons. These alterations may contribute to the neural substrate for
impaired gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.

The precise causal factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are not known,
although, decades of research have honed in on the
cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuitry in the brain as a critical
pathway involved in obsessions and the intimately linked compulsive-repetitive
behaviors. Recent progress in human and mouse genetics have led to the
identification of novel candidate susceptibility genes, which in turn have
facilitated a more focused approach to unraveling the nature of circuitry
dysfunction in OCD. The ability to perform invasive techniques in genetic animal 
models of OCD will be crucial for rapid advances in this field, and as such we
review the most recent developments and highlight the importance of searching out
common circuitry defects underlying compulsive-repetitive behaviors.

Heritable neurodevelopmental disorders are multifaceted disease conditions
encompassing a wide range of symptoms including intellectual disability,
cognitive dysfunction, autism and myriad other behavioral impairments. In cases
where single, causative genetic defects have been identified, such as Angelman
syndrome, Rett syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Fragile X syndrome, the
classical Drosophila genetic system has provided fruitful disease models. Recent 
Drosophila studies have advanced our understanding of UBE3A, MECP2, NF1 and FMR1 
function, respectively, in genetic, biochemical, anatomical, physiological and
behavioral contexts. Investigations in Drosophila continue to provide the
essential mechanistic understanding required to facilitate the conception of
rational therapeutic treatments.

The increasing incidence of depressive spectrum disorders worldwide, together
with the failure of current medication to effectively treat a significant
proportion of cases, calls for a better knowledge of the physiopathology of
depression and of the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Recent research has 
unveiled an array of new mechanisms through which antidepressant drugs help
restore neuronal plasticity and neurotransmission. In this review, we summarize
the latest advances in the field, focusing on the effectors and molecular
pathways that sustain the action of antidepressants. Grasping the overall brain
response to antidepressants, with an integrated overview of the neurotransmitter 
systems, signaling cascades and neural circuits at play, should help to design
more potent and selective therapies.

Neural circuit models for computations in early visual cortex.

Zhaoping L(1).

Author information:

Some cortical circuit models study the mechanisms of the transforms from visual
inputs to neural responses. They model neural properties such as feature tunings,
pattern sensitivities, and how they depend on intracortical connections and
contextual inputs. Other cortical circuit models are more concerned with
computational goals of the transform from visual inputs to neural responses, or
the roles of the neural responses in the visual behavior. The appropriate
complexity of a cortical circuit model depends on the question asked. Modeling
neural circuits of many interacting hypercolumns is a necessary challenge, which 
is providing insights to cortical computations, such as visual saliency
computation, and linking physiology with global visual cognitive behavior such as
bottom-up attentional selection.

A fundamental but unsolved problem in neuroscience is how connections between
neurons might underlie information processing in central circuits. Building
wiring diagrams of neural networks may accelerate our understanding of how they
compute. But even if we had wiring diagrams, it is critical to know what neurons 
in a circuit are doing: their physiology. In both the retina and cerebral cortex,
a great deal is known about topographic specificity, such as lamination and
cell-type specificity of connections. Little, however, is known about connections
as they relate to function. Here, we review how advances in functional imaging
and electron microscopy have recently allowed the examination of relationships
between sensory physiology and synaptic connections in cortical and retinal
circuits.

This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of how neural
divergence and convergence give rise to complex encoding properties of retinal
ganglion cells. We describe the apparent mismatch between the number of cone
bipolar cell types, and the diversity of excitatory input to retinal ganglion
cells, and outline two possible solutions. One proposal is for diversity in the
excitatory pathways to be generated within axon terminals of cone bipolar cells, 
and the second invokes narrow-field glycinergic amacrine cells that can
apparently act like bipolar cells by providing excitatory drive to ganglion
cells. Finally we highlight two advances in technique that promise to provide
future insights; automation of electron microscope data collection and analysis, 
and the use of the ideal observer to quantitatively compare neural performance at
all levels.

Neuronal firing in the hippocampal formation (HF) of freely moving rodents shows 
striking examples of spatialorganization in the form of place, directional,
boundary vector and grid cells. The firing of place and grid cells shows an
intriguing form of temporal organization known as 'theta phase precession'. We
review the mechanisms underlying theta phase precession of place cell firing,
ranging from membrane potential oscillations to recurrent connectivity, and the
relevant intra-cellular and extra-cellular data. We then consider the use of
these models to explain the spatial structure of grid cell firing, and review the
relevant intra-cellular and extra-cellular data. Finally, we consider the likely 
interaction between place cells, grid cells and boundary vector cells in
estimating self-location as a compromise between path-integration and
environmental information.

Spatial orientation behaviors in animals are fundamental for survival but poorly 
understood at the neuronal level. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans orients to 
a wide range of stimuli and has a numerically small and well-described nervous
system making it advantageous for investigating the mechanisms of spatial
orientation. Recent work by the C. elegans research community has identified
essential computational elements of the neural circuits underlying two
orientation strategies that operate in five different sensory modalities.
Analysis of these circuits reveals novel motifs including simple circuits for
computing temporal derivatives of sensory input and for integrating sensory input
with behavioral state to generate adaptive behavior. These motifs constitute
hypotheses concerning the identity and functionality of circuits controlling
spatial orientation in higher organisms.

Where are the 'prime movers' that control behavior? Which circuits in the brain
control the order in which individual motor gestures of a learned behavior are
generated, and the speed at which they progress? Here we describe two techniques 
recently applied to localizing and characterizing the circuitry underlying the
generation of vocal sequences in the songbird. The first utilizes small,
localized, temperature changes in the brain to perturb the speed of neural
dynamics. The second utilizes intracellular manipulation of membrane potential in
the freely behaving animal to perturb the dynamics within a single neuron. Both
of these techniques are broadly applicable in behaving animals to test hypotheses
about the biophysical and circuit dynamics that allow neural circuits to march
from one state to the next.

Synapses made by local interneurons dominate the intrinsic circuitry of the
mammalian visual thalamus and influence all signals traveling from the eye to
cortex. Here we draw on physiological and computational analyses of receptive
fields in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus to describe how inhibition helps
to enhance selectivity for stimulus features in space and time and to improve the
efficiency of the neural code. Further, we explore specialized synaptic
attributes of relay cells and interneurons and discuss how these might be adapted
to preserve the temporal precision of retinal spike trains and thereby maximize
the rate of information transmitted downstream.

Perception is about making sense, that is, understanding what events in the
outside world caused the sensory observations. Consistent with this intuition,
many aspects of human behavior confronting noise and ambiguity are well explained
by principles of causal inference. Extending these insights, recent studies have 
applied the same powerful set of tools to perceptual processing at the neural
level. According to these approaches, microscopic neural structures solve
elementary probabilistic tasks and can be combined to construct hierarchical
predictive models of the sensory input. This framework suggests that variability 
in neural responses reflects the inherent uncertainty associated with sensory
interpretations and that sensory neurons are active predictors rather than
passive filters of their inputs. Causal inference can account parsimoniously and 
quantitatively for non-linear dynamical properties in single synapses, single
neurons and sensory receptive fields.

How neurons encode information has been a hotly debated issue. Ultimately, any
code must be relevant to the senders, receivers, and connections between them.
This review focuses on the transmission of sensory information through the
circuit linking thalamus and cortex, two distant brain regions. Strong
feedforward inhibition in the thalamocortical circuit renders cortex highly
sensitive to the thalamic synchrony evoked by a sensory stimulus. Neuromodulators
and feedback connections may modulate the temporal sensitivity of such circuits
and gate the propagation of synchrony into other layers and cortical areas. The
prevalence of strong feedforward inhibitory circuits throughout the central
nervous system suggests that synchrony codes and timing-sensitive circuits may be
widespread, occurring well beyond sensory thalamus and cortex.

The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by intense spontaneous activity,
depending on brain region, age, and behavioral state. Classically, the cortex is 
considered as being driven by the senses, a paradigm which corresponds well to
experiments in quiescent or deeply anesthetized states. In awake animals,
however, the spontaneous activity cannot be considered as 'background noise', but
is of comparable-or even higher-amplitude than evoked sensory responses. Recent
evidence suggests that this internal activity is not only dominant, but also it
shares many properties with the responses to natural sensory inputs, suggesting
that the spontaneous activity is not independent of the sensory input. Such
evidence is reviewed here, with an emphasis on intracellular and computational
aspects. Statistical measures, such as the spike-triggered average of synaptic
conductances, show that the impact of internal network state on spiking activity 
is major in awake animals. Thus, cortical activity cannot be considered as being 
driven by the senses, but sensory inputs rather seem to modulate and modify the
internal dynamics of cerebral cortex. This view offers an attractive
interpretation not only of dreaming activity (absence of sensory input), but also
of several mental disorders.

Understanding the neural mechanisms of invariant object recognition remains one
of the major unsolved problems in neuroscience. A common solution that is thought
to be employed by diverse sensory systems is to create hierarchical
representations of increasing complexity and tolerance. However, in the mammalian
auditory system many aspects of this hierarchical organization remain
undiscovered, including the prominent classes of high-level representations (that
would be analogous to face selectivity in the visual system or selectivity to
bird's own song in the bird) and the dominant types of invariant transformations.
Here we review the recent progress that begins to probe the hierarchy of auditory
representations, and the computational approaches that can be helpful in
achieving this feat.

Spontaneous activity is found in many regions of the developing nervous system;
such activity is thought to be instructive for guiding developmental processes.
In particular, the developing retina generates correlated patterns of activity
known as retinal waves. We review the main theoretical models that have been
developed to study the mechanisms for generation and propagation of retinal
waves. Much of the progress in this field has been due to the close interaction
between experimentalists and theorists in analyzing and modeling spontaneous
activity. We conclude by describing spontaneous activity models in other systems 
and suggestions for future modeling work.

Neural circuits do not function in isolation; they interact with the physical
world, accepting sensory inputs and producing outputs via muscles. Since both
these pathways are constrained by physics, the activity of neural circuits can
only be understood by considering biomechanics of muscles, bodies, and the
exterior world. We discuss how animal bodies have natural stable motions that
require relatively little activation or control from the nervous system. The
nervous system can substantially alter these motions, by subtly changing
mechanical properties such as body or leg stiffness. Mechanics can also provide
robustness to perturbations without sensory reflexes. By considering a complete
neuromechanical system, neuroscientists and biomechanicians together can provide 
a more integrated view of neural circuitry and behavior.

The electric sense combines spatial aspects of vision and touch with temporal
features of audition. Its accessible neural architecture shares similarities with
mammalian sensory systems and allows for recordings from successive brain areas
to test hypotheses about neural coding. Further, electrosensory stimuli
encountered during prey capture, navigation, and communication, can be readily
synthesized in the laboratory. These features enable analyses of the neural
circuitry that reveal general principles of encoding and decoding, such as
segregation of information into separate streams and neural response
sparsification. A systems level understanding arises via linkage between cellular
differentiation and network architecture, revealed by in vitro and in vivo
analyses, while computational modeling reveals how single cell dynamics and
connectivity shape the sparsification process.

The biophysical models of spike-timing-dependent plasticity have explored
dynamics with molecular basis for such computational concepts as coincidence
detection, synaptic eligibility trace, and Hebbian learning. They overall support
different learning algorithms in different brain areas, especially supervised
learning in the cerebellum. Because a single spine is physically very small,
chemical reactions at it are essentially stochastic, and thus
sensitivity-longevity dilemma exists in the synaptic memory. Here, the cascade of
excitable and bistable dynamics is proposed to overcome this difficulty. All
kinds of learning algorithms in different brain regions confront with difficult
generalization problems. For resolution of this issue, the control of the
degrees-of-freedom can be realized by changing synchronicity of neural firing.
Especially, for cerebellar supervised learning, the triangle closed-loop circuit 
consisting of Purkinje cells, the inferior olive nucleus, and the cerebellar
nucleus is proposed as a circuit to optimally control synchronous firing and
degrees-of-freedom in learning.

Central Pattern Generator (CPG) networks, which organize rhythmic movements, have
long served as models for neural network organization. Modulatory inputs are
essential components of CPG function: neuromodulators set the parameters of CPG
neurons and synapses to render the networks functional. Each modulator acts on
the network by many effects which may oppose one another; this may serve to
stabilize the modulated state. Neuromodulators also determine the active neuronal
composition in the CPG, which varies with state changes such as locomotor speed. 
The pattern of gene expression which determines the electrophysiological
personality of each CPG neuron is also under modulatory control. It is not
possible to model the function of neural networks without including the actions
of neuromodulators.

Sound localization: Jeffress and beyond.

Many animals use the interaural time differences (ITDs) to locate the source of
low frequency sounds. The place coding theory proposed by Jeffress has long been 
a dominant model to account for the neural mechanisms of ITD detection. Recent
research, however, suggests a wider range of strategies for ITD coding in the
binaural auditory brainstem. We discuss how ITD is coded in avian, mammalian, and
reptilian nervous systems, and review underlying synaptic and cellular properties
that enable precise temporal computation. The latest advances in recording and
analysis techniques provide powerful tools for both overcoming and utilizing the 
large field potentials in these nuclei.

How does the connectivity of a neuronal circuit, together with the individual
properties of the cell types that take part in it, result in a given computation?
We examine this question in the context of retinal circuits. We suggest that the 
retina can be viewed as a parallel assemblage of many small computational
devices, highly stereotypical and task-specific circuits afferent to a given
ganglion cell type, and we discuss some rules that govern computation in these
devices. Multi-device processing in retina poses conceptual problems when it is
contrasted with cortical processing. We lay out open questions both on processing
in retinal circuits and on implications for cortical processing of retinal
inputs.

The hippocampus has contributed enormously to our understanding of the operation 
of elemental brain circuits, not least through the classification of forebrain
interneurons. Understanding the operation of interneuron networks however
requires not only a wiring diagram that describes the innervation and
postsynaptic targets of different GABAergic cells, but also an appreciation of
the temporal dimension. Interneurons differ extensively in their intrinsic firing
rates, their recruitment in different brain rhythms, and in their synaptic
kinetics. Furthermore, in common with principal neurons, both the synapses
innervating interneurons and the synapses made by these cells are highly
modifiable, reflecting both their recent or remote use (short-term and long-term 
plasticity) and the action of extracellular messengers. This review examines
recent progress in understanding how different hippocampal interneuron networks
contribute to feedback and feed-forward inhibition at different timescales.

Insect olfactory coding and memory at multiple timescales.

Insects can learn, allowing them great flexibility for locating seasonal food
sources and avoiding wily predators. Because insects are relatively simple and
accessible to manipulation, they provide good experimental preparations for
exploring mechanisms underlying sensory coding and memory. Here we review how the
intertwining of memory with computation enables the coding, decoding, and storage
of sensory experience at various stages of the insect olfactory system.
Individual parts of this system are capable of multiplexing memories at different
timescales, and conversely, memory on a given timescale can be distributed across
different parts of the circuit. Our sampling of the olfactory system emphasizes
the diversity of memories, and the importance of understanding these memories in 
the context of computations performed by different parts of a sensory system.

The cerebellum plays an essential role in motor learning. The ability to identify
specific sensory and motor signals carried by neurons with known connectivity
makes the cerebellum an attractive system for investigating how synaptic
plasticity relates to learning. Early studies focused primarily on a single form 
of plasticity, long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.
Recent work has highlighted both the diversity of synaptic plasticity that exists
within the cerebellum and the fact that individual plasticity mechanisms can have
unexpected consequences when they act within neural circuits.

Human sensorimotor learning: adaptation, skill, and beyond.

Recent studies of upper limb movements have provided insights into the
computations, mechanisms, and taxonomy of human sensorimotor learning. Motor
tasks differ with respect to how they weight different learning processes. These 
include adaptation, an internal-model based process that reduces
sensory-prediction errors in order to return performance to pre-perturbation
levels, use-dependent plasticity, and operant reinforcement. Visuomotor rotation 
and force-field tasks impose systematic errors and thereby emphasize adaptation. 
In skill learning tasks, which for the most part do not involve a perturbation,
improved performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and probably
depends less on adaptation and more on success-based exploration. Explicit
awareness and declarative memory contribute, to varying degrees, to motor
learning. The modularity of motor learning processes maps, at least to some
extent, onto distinct brain structures.

The cerebellum is a subcortical brain structure that is essential for learning
and controlling movement. Recent work shows that the cerebellum also plays a role
in certain perceptual abilities, beyond what would be expected secondary to poor 
movement control. This review covers these and other recent advances, focusing on
how cerebellar damage affects human abilities ranging from sensory perception to 
movement control and motor learning.

Echolocation operates through adaptive sensorimotor systems that collectively
enable the bat to localize and track sonar objects as it flies. The features of
sonar signals used by a bat to probe its surroundings determine the information
available to its acoustic imaging system. In turn, the bat's perception of a
complex scene guides its active adjustments in the features of subsequent sonar
vocalizations. Here, we propose that the bat's active vocal-motor behaviors play 
directly into its representation of a dynamic auditory scene.

Sensorimotor integration is a field rich in theory backed by a large body of
psychophysical evidence. Relating the underlying neural circuitry to these
theories has, however, been more challenging. With a wide array of complex
behaviors coordinated by their small brains, insects provide powerful model
systems to study key features of sensorimotor integration at a mechanistic level.
Insect neural circuits perform both hard-wired and learned sensorimotor
transformations. They modulate their neural processing based on both internal
variables, such as the animal's behavioral state, and external ones, such as the 
time of day. Here we present some studies using insect model systems that have
produced insights, at the level of individual neurons, about sensorimotor
integration and the various ways in which it can be modified by context.

Neural mechanisms for filtering self-generated sensory signals in cerebellum-like
circuits.

University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.

This review focuses on recent progress in understanding mechanisms for filtering 
self-generated sensory signals in cerebellum-like circuits in fish and mammals.
Recent in vitro studies in weakly electric gymnotid fish have explored the
interplay among anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic dynamics, and feedforward
inhibition in canceling self-generated electrosensory inputs. Studies of the
mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus have revealed multimodal integration and
anti-Hebbian plasticity, suggesting that this circuit may adaptively filter
incoming auditory information. In vivo studies in weakly electric mormryid fish
suggest a key role for granule cell coding in sensory filtering. The clear links 
between synaptic plasticity and systems level sensory filtering in
cerebellum-like circuits may provide insights into hypothesized adaptive
filtering functions of the cerebellum itself.

The role of a midbrain network in competitive stimulus selection.

A midbrain network interacts with the well-known frontoparietal forebrain network
to select stimuli for gaze and spatial attention. The midbrain network,
containing the superior colliculus (SC; optic tectum, OT, in non-mammalian
vertebrates) and the isthmic nuclei, helps evaluate the relative priorities of
competing stimuli and encodes them in a topographic map of space. Behavioral
experiments in monkeys demonstrate an essential contribution of the SC to
stimulus selection when the relative priorities of competing stimuli are similar.
Neurophysiological results from the owl OT demonstrate a neural correlate of this
essential contribution of the SC/OT. The multi-layered, spatiotopic organization 
of the midbrain network lends itself to the analysis and modeling of the
mechanisms underlying stimulus selection for gaze and spatial attention.

Skilled grasp is a sensorimotor process requiring the brain to extract sensory
cues from the environment to shape a motor command. Although a large body of
literature has focused on which brain areas either integrate the visual object's 
properties or control the motor output, it is still unclear how grasp-related
information is transferred from one area to another. Understanding interactions
between brain areas is crucial for the study of visuomotor transformations.
Recently, new advances in both human and non-human primates have shown it is
possible to study cortico-cortical interactions during different task contexts.
This sheds new light on how brain areas are integrated in a dynamic network for
controlling grasping actions.

Neuronal circuits underlying rhythmic behaviors (central pattern generators:
CPGs) can generate rhythmic motor output without sensory input. However, sensory 
input is pivotal for generating behaviorally relevant CPG output. Here we discuss
recent work in the decapod crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS)
identifying cellular and synaptic mechanisms whereby sensory inputs select
particular motor outputs from CPG circuits. This includes several examples in
which sensory neurons regulate the impact of descending projection neurons on CPG
circuits. This level of analysis is possible in the STNS due to the relatively
unique access to identified circuit, projection, and sensory neurons. These
studies are also revealing additional degrees of freedom in sensorimotor
integration that underlie the extensive flexibility intrinsic to rhythmic motor
systems.

brains. This review describes our growing understanding of how these creatures
use visual information to stabilize flight, avoid collisions with objects,
regulate flight speed, detect and intercept other flying insects such as mates or
prey, navigate to a distant food source, and orchestrate flawless landings. It
also outlines the ways in which these insights are now being used to develop
novel, biologically inspired strategies for the guidance of autonomous, airborne 
vehicles.

As we move through the world, information can be combined from multiple sources
in order to allow us to perceive our self-motion. The vestibular system detects
and encodes the motion of the head in space. In addition, extra-vestibular cues
such as retinal-image motion (optic flow), proprioception, and motor efference
signals, provide valuable motion cues. Here I focus on the coding strategies that
are used by the brain to create neural representations of self-motion. I review
recent studies comparing the thresholds of single versus populations of
vestibular afferent and central neurons. I then consider recent advances in
understanding the brain's strategy for combining information from the vestibular 
sensors with extra-vestibular cues to estimate self-motion. These studies
emphasize the need to consider not only the rules by which multiple inputs are
combined, but also how differences in the behavioral context govern the nature of
what defines the optimal computation.

Uncertainty is ubiquitous in our sensorimotor interactions, arising from factors 
such as sensory and motor noise and ambiguity about the environment. Setting it
apart from previous theories, a quintessential property of the Bayesian framework
for making inference about the state of world so as to select actions, is the
requirement to represent the uncertainty associated with inferences in the form
of probability distributions. In the context of sensorimotor control and
learning, the Bayesian framework suggests that to respond optimally to
environmental stimuli the central nervous system needs to construct estimates of 
the sensorimotor transformations, in the form of internal models, as well as
represent the structure of the uncertainty in the inputs, outputs and in the
transformations themselves. Here we review Bayesian inference and learning models
that have been successful in demonstrating the sensitivity of the sensorimotor
system to different forms of uncertainty as well as recent studies aimed at
characterizing the representation of the uncertainty at different computational
levels.

Performance in sensory-motor behaviors guides our understanding of many of the
key computational functions of the brain: the representation of sensory
information, the translation of sensory signals to commands for movement, and the
production of behavior. Eye movement behaviors have become a valuable testing
ground for theories of neural computation because the neural circuitry has been
well characterized and the mechanical control of the eye is comparatively simple.
Here I review recent studies of eye movement behaviors that provide insight into 
sensory-motor computation at the single neuron and systems levels. They show that
errors in sensory estimation dominate eye movement variability and that the motor
system functions to reduce the behavioral impact of its own intrinsic noise
sources.

The multiple roles of Purkinje cells in sensori-motor calibration: to predict,
teach and command.

Neurophysiological recordings in the cerebellar cortex of awake-behaving animals 
are revolutionizing the way we think about the role of Purkinje cells in
sensori-motor calibration. Early theorists suggested that if a movement became
miscalibrated, Purkinje cell output would be changed to adjust the motor command 
and restore good performance. The finding that Purkinje cell activity changed in 
many sensori-motor calibration tasks was taken as strong support for this
hypothesis. Based on more recent data, however, it has been suggested that
changes in Purkinje cell activity do not contribute to the motor command
directly; instead, they are used either as a teaching signal, or to predict the
altered kinematics of the movement after calibration has taken place. I will

contribute to command generation, teaching, and prediction at different times
during sensori-motor calibration.

We use saccades several times per second to move the fovea between points of
interest and build an understanding of our visual environment. Recent behavioral 
experiments show evidence for the integration of pre- and postsaccadic
information (even subliminally), the modulation of visual sensitivity, and the
rapid reallocation of attention. The recent physiological literature has
identified a characteristic modulation of neural responsiveness-perisaccadic
reduction followed by a postsaccadic increase-that is found in many visual areas,
but whose source is as yet unknown. This modulation seems optimal for reducing
sensitivity during and boosting sensitivity between saccades, but no study has
yet established a direct causal link between neural and behavioral changes.

How are novel actions generated and learned? We introduce a selectionist view of 
de novo action learning, and present some of the main postulates of such a view. 
This view contrasts with the notion that all actions are generated in response to
particular stimuli and hence instructed by the world. It postulates that actions 
are generated in the actor (the organism) and selected by the environment
(stimuli). Selection may occur iteratively until actions can be executed more
rapidly and precisely, less variably, and eventually be elicited by particular
stimuli. We also discuss experiments that support the particular predictions of
this theory.

How neural circuits underlie the acquisition and control of learned motor
behaviors has traditionally been explored in monkeys and, more recently,
songbirds. The development of genetic tools for functional circuit analysis in
rodents, the availability of transgenic animals with well characterized
phenotypes, and the relative ease with which rats and mice can be trained to
perform various motor tasks, make rodents attractive models for exploring the
neural circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and production of learned
motor skills. Here we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of this approach,
review recent trends and results, and outline possible strategies for wider
adoption of rodents as a model system for complex motor learning.

When a monkey attends to a visual stimulus, neurons in visual cortex respond
differently to that stimulus than when the monkey attends elsewhere. In the 25
years since the initial discovery, the study of attention in primates has been
central to understanding flexible visual processing. Recent experiments
demonstrate that visual neurons in mice and fruit flies are modulated by
locomotor behaviors, like running and flying, in a manner that resembles
attention-based modulations in primates. The similar findings across species
argue for a more generalized view of state-dependent sensory processing and for a
renewed dialogue among vertebrate and invertebrate research communities.

We review the influence of context on behavioral choice. Context can refer to
external (environmental) factors such as the season or presence of predators and 
it can also refer to the internal or behavioral state of an animal. Usually,
animals make decisions in the midst of other ongoing behaviors. We discuss recent
findings on the impact of both types of contexts, focusing on how context gets
encoded at the intersection between the sensory and motor systems, emphasizing
the role of neuromodulators. We also review recent technological advances that
have made feasible the exploration of neural correlates of decision making in
freely moving, behaving animals.

The past decade has seen a dramatic change in our understanding of the role of
the striatum in behavior. Early perspectives emphasized a role for the striatum
in habitual learning of stimulus-response associations and sequences of actions. 
Recent advances from human neuroimaging research suggest a broader role for the
striatum in motivated learning. New findings demonstrate that the striatum
represents multiple learning signals and highlight the contribution of the
striatum across many cognitive domains and contexts. Recent findings also
emphasize interactions between the striatum and other specialized brain systems
for learning. Together, these findings suggest that the striatum contributes to a
distributed network that learns to select actions based on their predicted value 
in order to optimize behavior.

Although the notion that dopaminergic neurons utilize glutamate as a
co-transmitter has long been supported by tantalizing molecular,
immunocytochemical and electrophysiological evidence it has only been with the
recent addition of optogenetic and other approaches that the existence and
functional relevance of this mechanism could be unambiguously demonstrated. Here 
we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of glutamate released from
mesoaccumbens dopaminergic neurons based on recently accumulated evidence.
Surprisingly, rather then to confirm a role in conventional fast excitatory
transmission, the latest evidence suggests that glutamate released from
dopaminergic neurons may primarily act through different unconventional
presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.

Alternative conceptions of memory consolidation and the role of the hippocampus
at the systems level in rodents.

We discuss very recent experiments with rodents addressing the idea that
long-term memories initially depending on the hippocampus, over a prolonged
period, become independent of it. No unambiguous recent evidence exists to
substantiate that this occurs. Most experiments find that recent and remote
memories are equally affected by hippocampus damage. Nearly all experiments that 
report spared remote memories suffer from two problems: retrieval could be based 
upon substantial regions of spared hippocampus and recent memory is tested at
intervals that are of the same order of magnitude as cellular consolidation.
Accordingly, we point the way beyond systems consolidation theories, both the
Standard Model of Consolidation and the Multiple Trace Theory, and propose a
simpler multiple storage site hypothesis. On this view, with event reiterations, 
different memory representations are independently established in multiple
networks. Many detailed memories always depend on the hippocampus; the others may
be established and maintained independently.

FOXP2 and the role of cortico-basal ganglia circuits in speech and language
evolution.

Enard W(1).

Author information:

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: A reduced dosage of the transcription factor FOXP2 leads
to speech and language impairments probably owing to deficits in cortical and
subcortical neural circuits. Based on evolutionary sequence analysis it has been 
proposed that the two amino acid substitutions that occurred on the human lineage
have been positively selected. Here I review recent studies investigating the
functional consequences of these two substitutions and discuss how these first
endeavors to study human brain evolution can be interpreted in the context of
speech and language evolution.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mice carrying the two substitutions in their endogenous Foxp2
gene show specific alterations in dopamine levels, striatal synaptic plasticity
and neuronal morphology. Mice carrying only one functional Foxp2, show additional
and partly opposite effects suggesting that FOXP2 has contributed to tuning
cortico-basal ganglia circuits during human evolution. Evidence from human and
songbird studies suggest that this could have been relevant during language
acquisition or vocal learning, respectively.
SUMMARY: FOXP2 could have contributed to the evolution of human speech and
language by adapting cortico-basal ganglia circuits. More generally the recent
studies allow careful optimism that aspects of human brain evolution can be
investigated in model systems such as the mouse.

The hippocampus, a structure required for many types of memory, connects to the
medial prefrontal cortex, an area that helps direct neuronal information streams 
during intentional behaviors. Increasing evidence suggests that oscillations
regulate communication between these two regions. Theta rhythms may facilitate
hippocampal inputs to the medial prefrontal cortex during mnemonic tasks and may 
also integrate series of functionally relevant gamma-mediated cell assemblies in 
the medial prefrontal cortex. During slow-wave sleep, temporal coordination of
hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and medial prefrontal cortex spindles may be an
important component of the process by which memories become
hippocampus-independent. Studies using rodent models indicate that oscillatory
phase-locking is disturbed in schizophrenia, emphasizing the need for more
studies of oscillatory synchrony in the hippocampal-prefrontal network.

Fragile X syndrome and the amygdala.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly inherited form of mental impairment
and autism. Current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying FXS symptoms is derived mainly from studies on the hippocampus and
cortex. However, FXS is also associated with strong emotional symptoms, which are
likely to involve changes in the amygdala. Unfortunately, the synaptic basis of
amygdalar dysfunction in FXS remains largely unexplored. Here we describe recent 
findings from mouse models of FXS that have identified synaptic defects in the
basolateral amygdala that are in many respects distinct from those reported
earlier in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation and surface expression of
AMPA-receptors are impaired. Further, presynaptic defects are seen at both
excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Remarkably, some of these synaptic defects in
the amygdala are also amenable to pharmacological rescue. These results also
underscore the need to modify the current hippocampus-centric framework to better
explain FXS-related synaptic dysfunction in the amygdala.

Cholinergic modulation of synaptic integration and dendritic excitability in the 
striatum.

Modulatory interneurons such as, the cholinergic interneuron, are always a
perplexing subject to study. Far from clear-cut distinctions such as excitatory
or inhibitory, modulating interneurons can have many, often contradictory
effects. The striatum is one of the most densely expressing brain areas for
cholinergic markers, and actylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in regulating
synaptic transmission and cellular excitability. Every cell type in the striatum 
has receptors for ACh. Yet even for a given cell type, ACh affecting different
receptors can have seemingly opposing roles. This review highlights relevant
effects of ACh on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and suggests how
its many effects may work in concert to modulate MSN firing properties.

For many years, the hippocampal formation has been implicated in the regulation
of negative emotion, yet the nature of this link has remained elusive. Recent
studies have made important links between the hippocampus and regulation of
stress hormones that affect aversive memory. Additional studies have shown that
the hippocampus regulates the gating of fear by contextual information. An
emerging literature also links the hippocampus to prediction errors during fear
learning and extinction. The mechanisms by which the hippocampus regulates
negative emotion are clearly complicated, but suggest that interventions aimed at
restoring normal hippocampal function may help with disorders of negative affect,
such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

Accumulating evidence shows that the neural network of the cerebral cortex and
the basal ganglia is critically involved in reinforcement learning. Recent
studies found functional heterogeneity within the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, 
especially in its ventromedial to dorsolateral axis. Here we review computational
issues in reinforcement learning and propose a working hypothesis on how multiple
reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented in the cortico-basal ganglia
circuit using different representations of states, values, and actions.

Dopamine has long been implicated in a wide variety of high-level cognitive
processes, ranging from working memory to rule learning and attention switching. 
Notable progress has been made in the past decades, but the mechanisms underlying
effects of dopamine on high-level cognition remain unclear. This article reviews 
evidence for an important role of the striatum and its interaction with the
prefrontal cortex and suggests a variety of ways by which changes in dopamine
transmission can bias high-level cognition.

Stress has complex effects on memory function that can vary depending on the type
of information that is learned and in relation to inter-individual
characteristics. Recent work has also shown that stress can switch performance
between memory systems, biasing it toward habit in detriment of spatial or
goal-directed strategies. In addition, novel synaptic mechanisms have been
implicated in the effects of stress in plasticity and memory. Computational
modeling is emerging as a useful approach to integrate and to ascertain neural
and cognitive computations underlying different effects of stress in memory.
Having provided novel explanations for the inverted-U-shaped relationship between
stress and cognitive performance, model-based analysis studies can improve our
understanding of diverse effects of stress in cognition and psychopathology.

The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex subserve spatial working memory in
rodents. Recent evidence has demonstrated functional interactions between these
brain regions in the form of sychronization of oscillatory activity during
behavior. The nature of this synchrony and its relationship to behavioral
performance suggests an important role in the function of the
hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.

We consider the potential role of oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 
mediating attention, working memory and memory consolidation. Activity in the
theta, beta, and gamma bands is related to communication between PFC and
different brain areas. While gamma/beta oscillations mediate bottom-up and
top-down interactions between PFC and visual cortices, related to attention,
theta rhythms are engaged by hippocampal/PFC interplay. These interactions are
dynamic, depending on the nature and relevance of the information currently being
processed. The profound modifications of the PFC neuronal network associated with
changes in oscillatory coherence are controlled by neuromodulators such as
dopamine, which thereby allow or prevent the formation of cell assemblies for
information encoding and storage.

Multiplicity of control in the basal ganglia: computational roles of striatal
subregions.

The basal ganglia, in particular the striatum, are central to theories of
behavioral control, and often identified as a seat of action selection.
Reinforcement learning (RL) models--which have driven much recent experimental
work on this region--cast striatum as a dynamic controller, integrating sensory
and motivational information to construct efficient and enriching behavioral
policies. Befitting this informationally central role, the BG sit at the nexus of
multiple anatomical 'loops' of synaptic projections, connecting a wide range of
cortical and subcortical structures. Numerous pioneering anatomical studies
conducted over the past several decades have meticulously catalogued these loops,
and labeled them according to the inferred functions of the connected regions.
The specific cotermina of the projections are highly localized to several
different subregions of the striatum, leading to the suggestion that these
subregions perform complementary but distinct functions. However, until recently,
the dominant computational framework outlined only a bipartite, dorsal/ventral,
division of striatum. We review recent computational and experimental advances
that argue for a more finely fractionated delineation. In particular,
experimental data provide extensive insight into unique functions subserved by
the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). These functions appear to correspond well with
theories of a 'model-based' RL subunit, and may also shed light on the
suborganization of ventral striatum. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these
ideas and how they point the way toward future refinements of neurocomputational 
theories of striatal function, bringing them into contact with other areas of
computational theory and other regions of the brain.

Extensive evidence implicates the ventral striatum in multiple distinct facets of
action selection. Early work established a role in modulating ongoing behavior,
as engaged by the energizing and directing influences of motivationally relevant 
cues and the willingness to expend effort in order to obtain reward. More
recently, reinforcement learning models have suggested the notion of ventral
striatum primarily as an evaluation step during learning, which serves as a
critic to update a separate actor. Recent computational and experimental work may
provide a resolution to the differences between these two theories through a
careful parsing of behavior and the instrinsic heterogeneity that characterizes
this complex structure.

During slow wave sleep and quiet wakefulness, the hippocampus generates high
frequency field oscillations (ripples) during which pyramidal neurons replay
previous waking activity in a temporally compressed manner. As a result,
reactivated firing patterns occur within shorter time windows propitious for
synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal network and in downstream neocortical 
structures. This is consistent with the long-held view that ripples participate
in strengthening and reorganizing memory traces, possibly by mediating
information transfer to neocortical areas. Recent studies have confirmed that
ripples and associated neuronal reactivations play a causal role in memory
consolidation during sleep and rest. However, further research will be necessary 
to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of memory consolidation,
in particular the selection of reactivated assemblies, and the functional
specificity of awake ripples.

Hippocampus and neocortex: recognition and spatial memory.

Recognition and spatial memory are typically associated with the perirhinal
cortex and hippocampal formation, respectively. Solely focusing on these
structures for these specific mnemonic functions may, however, be limiting
progress in the field. The distinction between these subdivisions of memory is
becoming less defined as, for example, hippocampal cells traditionally considered
to encode locations also encode place-object associations. There is increasing
evidence for the involvement of overlapping networks of brain structures for
aspects of both spatial and recognition memory. Future models of spatial and
recognition memory will have to extend beyond the hippocampus and perirhinal
cortex to incorporate a wider network of cortical and subcortical structures.

The hippocampal learning-behavior translation and the functional significance of 
hippocampal dysfunction in schizophrenia.

How is hippocampal learning, including place learning, translated into behavior? 
The hippocampus integrates, along its septotemporal axis, substrates of rapid
place learning, including entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity, with functional
connectivity to subcortical sites and prefrontal cortex, which play central roles
in behavioral-control functions, including sensorimotor, emotional, motivational,
attentional, and executive functions. I present recent evidence that such
integration, for which the intermediate hippocampus is a key neuroanatomical
substrate, enables translation of rapid place learning into adaptive behavior.
What are the clinical implications of the hippocampal learning-behavior
translation? Focusing on hippocampal overactivity, which has emerged as a central
feature of schizophrenia pathophysiology, I highlight how, due to functional
connectivity enabling the learning-behavior translation, hippocampal dysfunction 
may cause not only memory deficits, but also neural-network disruptions
underlying psychosis and attentional and executive deficits.

The formation and refinement of synaptic circuits are areas of research that have
fascinated neurobiologists for decades. A recurrent theme seen at many CNS
synapses is that neuronal connections are at first imprecise, but refine and can 
be rearranged with time or with experience. Today, with the advent of new
technologies to map and monitor neuronal circuits, it is worthwhile to revisit a 
powerful experimental model for examining the development and plasticity of
synaptic circuits--the retinogeniculate synapse.

Activity-dependent modification of excitatory synaptic transmission is a
fundamental mechanism for developmental plasticity of the neural circuits and
experience-dependent plasticity. Synaptic glutamatergic receptors including AMPA 
receptors and NMDA receptors (AMPARs and NMDARs) are embedded in the postsynaptic
density, a highly organized protein network. Overwhelming data have shown that
PSD-95-like membrane associated guanylate kinases (PSD-MAGUKs), a major family of
scaffold proteins at glutamatergic synapses, regulate basal synaptic AMPAR
function and trafficking. It is now clear that PSD-MAGUKs have multifaceted
functions in regulating both basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.
Here we discuss recent advancements in understanding the roles of PSD-95 and
other family members of PSD-MAGUKs in synaptic plasticity, both as an anchoring
protein for synaptic AMPARs and as a signaling scaffold for mediating the
interaction of the signaling complex and NMDARs.

Synapses exhibit diverse functional properties, and it seems likely that these
properties are specialized to perform specific computations. The Drosophila
antennal lobe provides a useful experimental preparation for exploring the
relationship between synaptic physiology and neural computations. This review
summarizes recent progress in describing synaptic properties in the Drosophila
antennal lobe. These studies reveal that several types of synapses in this
circuit are highly specialized, and that these specializations are in some cases 
under tight regulatory control. These synaptic specializations can be understood 
in terms of the computational features they confer on the circuit. Specifically, 
many of these properties appear to promote odor detection when odor
concentrations are low, while promoting adaptive gain control when odor
concentrations are high.

During the induction of plasticity of dendritic spines, many intracellular
signaling pathways are spatially and temporally regulated to co-ordinate
downstream cellular processes in different dendritic micron-domains. Recent
advent of imaging technology based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) has allowed the direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal regulation of
signaling activity in spines and dendrites during synaptic plasticity. In
particular, the activity of three small GTPase proteins HRas, Cdc42, and RhoA,
which share similar structure and mobility on the plasma membrane, displayed
different spatial spreading patterns: Cdc42 is compartmentalized in the
stimulated spines while RhoA and HRas spread into dendrites over 5-10 μm. These
measurements thus provide the basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying
the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling activity. Further, using
spatiotemporally controlled spine stimulations, some of the roles of signal
spreading have been revealed.

GABAB receptor modulation of synaptic function.

NY 10003, United States.

Neuromodulators have complex effects on both the presynaptic release and
postsynaptic detection of neurotransmitters. Here we describe recent advances in 
our understanding of synaptic modulation by metabotropic GABAB receptors. By
inhibiting multivesicular release from the presynaptic terminal, these receptors 
decrease the synaptic glutamate signal. GABAB receptors also inhibit the Ca2+
permeability of NMDA receptors to decrease Ca2+ signals in postsynaptic spines.
These new findings highlight the importance of GABAB receptors in regulating many
aspects of synaptic transmission. They also point to novel questions about the
spatiotemporal dynamics and sources of synaptic modulation in the brain.

A growing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is involved in the
modulation of certain types of hippocampus-dependent memory. Recent studies
suggest that newly born neurons play a key role in pattern separation mediated by
the dentate gyrus, in systems consolidation, through which memory becomes
progressively independent of the hippocampus, and in social memory-based
reproductive behavior. Furthermore, neural activity and learning are now thought 
to regulate the proliferation of neuronal precursors as well as the survival and 
apoptosis of new neurons. Moreover, these processes also affect the development
of the dendritic arbor and dendritic spines of new neurons, thereby modulating
the integration of adult-born neurons into the functional neural circuit.

The cerebellar cortical circuit with its organized and repetitive structure
provides an excellent model system for studying how brain circuits are formed
during development. The emergence of the mature brain requires that appropriate
synaptic connections are formed and refined, which in the rodent cerebellum
occurs primarily during the first three postnatal weeks. Developing circuits
typically differ substantially from their mature counterparts, which suggests
that development may not simply involve synaptic refinement, but rather involves 
restructuring of key synaptic components and network connections, in a manner
reminiscent of metamorphosis. Here, we discuss recent evidence that, taken
together, suggests that transient features of developing cerebellar synapses may 
act to coordinate network activity, and thereby shape the development of the
cerebellar microcircuit.

Short-term forms of presynaptic plasticity.

States.

Synapses exhibit several forms of short-term plasticity that play a multitude of 
computational roles. Short-term depression suppresses neurotransmitter release
for hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds; facilitation and post-tetanic
potentiation lead to synaptic enhancement lasting hundreds of milliseconds to
minutes. Recent advances have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying
these forms of plasticity. Vesicle depletion, as well as inactivation of both
release sites and calcium channels, contribute to synaptic depression. Mechanisms
of short-term enhancement include calcium channel facilitation, local depletion
of calcium buffers, increases in the probability of release downstream of calcium
influx, altered vesicle pool properties, and increases in quantal size. Moreover,
there is a growing appreciation of the heterogeneity of vesicles and release
sites and how they can contribute to use-dependent plasticity.

In the central nervous system, space is at a premium. This is especially true in 
the retina, where synapses, cells, and circuitry have evolved to maximize
signal-processing capacity within a thin, optically transparent tissue. For
example, at some retinal synapses, single presynaptic active zones contact
multiple postsynaptic targets; some individual neurons perform completely
different tasks depending on visual conditions, while others execute hundreds of 
circuit computations in parallel; and the retinal network adapts, at various
levels, to the ever-changing visual world. Each of these features reflects
efficient use of limited cellular resources to optimally encode visual
information.

Signals generated in distal subcellular compartments of neurons must often travel
long distances to the nucleus to trigger changes in gene expression. This
retrograde signaling is critical to the development, function, and survival of
neural circuits, and neurons have evolved multiple mechanisms to transmit signals
over long distances. In this review, we briefly summarize the range of mechanisms
whereby distally generated signals are transported to neuronal nuclei. We then
focus on the transport of soluble signals from the synapse to the nucleus during 
neuronal plasticity.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand gated ion channels that
mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain of vertebrates. A rapidly
growing body of crystal structures for isolated iGluR extracellular domains, and 
more recently a full length AMPA receptor, combined with data from
electrophysiological experiments and MD simulations, provides a framework that
makes it possible to investigate the molecular basis for assembly, gating and
modulation. These unprecedented advances in structural biology are constantly
challenged by novel functional properties that emerge despite decades of
functional analysis, and by a growing family of auxiliary proteins that modulate 
iGluR activity and assembly.

Cbln1 is a newly identified synaptic organizer belonging to the C1q family.
Unlike other synaptic organizers, a deficiency in Cbln1 is sufficient to cause a 
severe reduction in the number of synapses between cerebellar Purkinje cells and 
parallel fibers (PFs). Furthermore, Cbln1 can rapidly induce synaptogenesis and
is necessary for maintaining normal synapses in the mature cerebellum in vivo.
Cbln1 was recently identified as the missing ligand for the orphan glutamate
receptor δ2 (GluD2), which is expressed in Purkinje cells. Furthermore, Cbln1
released from PFs binds to neurexin (NRX) expressed on the presynaptic PFs and
GluD2 at the postsynaptic site. The NRX/Cbln1/GluD2 tripartite complex is
resistant to low extracellular Ca2+ levels and serves as a unique bidirectional
synaptic organizer.

Experience-dependent modifications of neural circuits and function are believed
to heavily depend on changes in synaptic efficacy such as LTP/LTD. Hence, much
effort has been devoted to elucidating the mechanisms underlying these forms of
synaptic plasticity. Although most of this work has focused on excitatory
synapses, it is now clear that diverse mechanisms of long-term inhibitory
plasticity have evolved to provide additional flexibility to neural circuits. By 
changing the excitatory/inhibitory balance, GABAergic plasticity can regulate
excitability, neural circuit function and ultimately, contribute to learning and 
memory, and neural circuit refinement. Here we discuss recent advancements in our
understanding of the mechanisms and functional relevance of GABAergic inhibitory 
synaptic plasticity.

Differential regulation of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release at
central synapses.

Recent studies have begun to scrutinize the presynaptic machinery and vesicle
populations that give rise to action potential evoked and spontaneous forms of
neurotransmitter release. In several cases this work produced unexpected results 
which lend support to the notion that regulation, mechanisms, postsynaptic
targets and possibly presynaptic origins of evoked and spontaneous
neurotransmitter release differ. Furthermore, the list of regulatory pathways
that impact spontaneous and evoked release in a divergent manner is rapidly
growing. These findings challenge our classical views on the relationship between
evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission. In contrast to the well-characterized
neuromodulatory pathways that equally suppress or augment all forms of
neurotransmitter release, molecular substrates specifically controlling
spontaneous release remain unclear. In this review, we outline possible
mechanisms that may underlie the differential regulation of distinct forms of
neurotransmission and help demultiplex complex neuronal signals and generate
parallel signaling events at their postsynaptic targets.

Excitatory synapses onto projection neurons in the striatum, the input nucleus of
the basal ganglia, play a key role in regulating basal ganglia circuit function
and are a major site of long-term synaptic plasticity. Here, we review the
mechanisms and regulation of both long-term potentiation and long-term depression
at these synapses. In particular, we highlight the role that neuromodulators play
in determining the strength and direction of plasticity, which ultimately shapes 
the balance of activity in basal ganglia circuits and regulates motor behavior.

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are heterotetromeric complexes composed of GluA1-4
subunits. They are glutamate-gated channels traditionally considered solely as
ion carriers for postsynaptic depolarization. However, the existence and dynamic 
regulation of GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPARs (Cp-AMPARs) enable these
special receptors to serve also as signaling molecules presumably via calcium
influx. Recent studies have implicated Cp-AMPARs in several types of synaptic
plasticity, including homeostatic synaptic regulation and Hebbian synaptic
plasticity. Cp-AMPARs are usually expressed transiently at an early stage of
synaptic plasticity, but are then replaced with normal GluA2-containing
receptors, indicating a role for Cp-AMPARs in induction, rather than the
maintenance, of synaptic plasticity.

The influence of synaptic activity on neuronal health.

UK.

According to the theory of neuronal health, neurons exist in a spectrum of states
ranging from highly resilient to vulnerable. An unhealthy neuron may be rendered 
dysfunctional or non-viable by an insult that would ordinarily be non-toxic to a 
healthy neuron. Over the years it has become clear that a neuron's health is
subject to dynamic regulation by electrical or synaptic activity. This review
highlights recently identified activity dependent signalling events that boost
neuronal health through the transcriptional control of pro-apoptotic and
anti-apoptotic genes, the enhancement of antioxidant defences, and the regulation
of mitochondrial and neurotrophic factor availability. Furthermore, activity
dependent signals have recently been shown to influence a variety of events
specific to individual neurodegenerative diseases, which will also be
highlighted.

The emergence of astroglia as an important participant of the synaptic machinery 
has led to the 'tripartite synapse' hypothesis. Recent findings suggest that
synaptic signaling also involves the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). The 
ECM can incorporate and store molecular traces of both neuronal and glial
activities. It can also modulate function of local receptors or ion channels and 
send diffuse molecular signals using products of its use-dependent proteolytic
cleavage. Recent experimental findings implicate the ECM in mechanisms of
synaptic plasticity and glial remodeling, thus lending support to the
'tetrapartite synapse' concept. This inclusive view might help to understand
better the mechanisms underlying signal integration and novel forms of long-term 
homeostatic regulation in the brain.

Centre, University of British Columbia, Canada.

Classic cadherins function as key organizers during the formation and remodeling 
of synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system. Cadherins are
Ca2+-dependent homophilic adhesion molecules whose adhesive strength can be
regulated by conformational changes, through cadherin's association with
intracellular binding proteins, and by the regulation of cadherin turnover and
internalization. In this mini-review, we will highlight recent studies on the
role of cadherins and their associated partners in regulating synaptic
architecture. Moreover, we will discuss molecular mechanisms underlying cadherin 
turnover and the subsequent impact on synaptic connections.

In response to calcium influx, synaptic vesicles fuse very rapidly with the
plasma membrane to release their neurotransmitter content. An important mechanism
for sustained release includes the formation of new vesicles by local
endocytosis. How synaptic vesicles are trafficked from the sites of endocytosis
to the sites of release and how they are maintained at the release sites remain
poorly understood. Recent studies using fast freezing immobilization and electron
tomography have led to insights on the ultrastructural organization of
presynaptic boutons and how these structural elements may maintain synaptic
vesicles and organize their exocytosis at particular areas of the plasma
membrane.

Mechanisms of excitatory synapse maturation by trans-synaptic organizing
complexes.

Synapses are specialized cell-cell adhesion contacts that mediate communication
within neural networks. During development, excitatory synapses are generated by 
step-wise recruitment of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins to sites of
contact. Several classes of synaptic organizing complexes have been identified
that function during the initial stages of synapse formation. However, mechanisms
underlying the later stages of synapse development are less well understood. In
recent years, molecules have been discovered that appear to play a role in
synapse maturation. In this review, we highlight recent findings that have
provided key insights for understanding postsynaptic maturation of developing
excitatory synapses with a focus on recruitment of AMPA receptors to developing
synapses.

The formation of synaptic connections requires a dialogue between pre and
postsynaptic cells to coordinate the assembly of the presynaptic release
machinery and the postsynaptic receptive complexes. Signaling molecules of the
Wnt family of proteins are central to this trans-synaptic dialogue. At the
neuromuscular junction and central synapses, Wnts promote synaptic assembly by
signaling to the developing pre and postsynaptic compartments. In addition, new
studies reveal that expression of Wnt proteins and localization of their Fz
receptors are regulated by neuronal activity. Importantly, Wnts mediates the
synaptic changes induced by patterned neuronal activity or sensory experience in 
mature neurons. Here we review recent findings into the function of Wnt signaling
at the synapse and its link to activity-dependent synaptic growth and function.

The development of the Drosophila olfactory system is a striking example of how
genetic programs specify a large number of different neuron types and assemble
them into functional circuits. To ensure precise odorant perception, each sensory
neuron has to not only select a single olfactory receptor (OR) type out of a
large genomic repertoire but also segregate its synaptic connections in the brain
according to the OR class identity. Specification and patterning of second-order 
interneurons in the olfactory brain center occur largely independent of sensory
input, followed by a precise point-to-point matching of sensory and relay
neurons. Here we describe recent progress in the understanding of how
cell-intrinsic differentiation programs and context-dependent cellular
interactions generate a stereotyped sensory map in the Drosophila brain. Recent
findings revealed an astonishing morphological diversity among members of the
same interneuron class, suggesting an unexpected variability in local
microcircuits involved in insect sensory processing.

Nervous systems are built of a myriad of neurons connected by an even larger
number of synapses. While it has been long known that neurons specifically select
their synaptic partners among many possible choices during development, we only
begin to understand how they make those decisions. Recent findings have started
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic target selection
including positive as well as negative cues from synaptic partners, intermediate 
targets and surrounding tissues. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that
synaptic connections are not only formed among specific sets of neurons, but also
targeted to specific subcellular domains. Finally, spatial and temporal
transcriptional regulation of these molecular cues represents an additional,
versatile mechanism to provide wiring specificity.

The maturation of cortical interneuron diversity: how multiple developmental

If the classical functional attribute of cortical GABAergic interneurons is to
mediate synaptic inhibition in the adult cortex, it is becoming evident that
their major task is instead to shape the spatio-temporal dynamics of the network 
oscillations that support most brain functions. This complex function involves a 
division of labour between morpho-physiologically diverse interneuron subtypes.
Both the central network function and the bewildering heterogeneity of the
interneuron population are especially emphasized during cortical development: at 
early postnatal stages, a single GABAergic neuron can efficiently pace the
activity of hundreds of other cells, whereas some interneuron subtypes are still 
poorly developed. Given the role of coherent activity in brain development, this 
confers to GABAergic interneurons a major role in the proper maturation of
cortical networks.

Neural stem and progenitor cells giving rise to neurons in developing mammalian
neocortex fall into two principal classes with regard to location of
mitosis-apical and basal, and into three principal classes in terms of cell
polarity during mitosis-bipolar, monopolar, and nonpolar. Insight has been gained
into how inheritance of polarized, apical and basal, cell constituents is related
to symmetric versus asymmetric divisions of these progenitors, and how this
inheritance is linked to their expansion, self-renewal, and neurogenesis.
Retention and inheritance of the basal process emerge as key for self-renewal,
notably for the monopolar progenitors of prospective gyrencephalic neocortex that
undergo asymmetric mitoses at basal locations. The resulting expansion of the
neocortex during evolution is proposed to be associated with an increased
cone-shape of radial units.

Regulation of cell adhesions and motility during initiation of neural crest
migration.

Accurate neural crest cell (NCC) migration requires tight control of cell
adhesions, cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. Cadherins and RhoGTPases are 
critical molecular players that regulate adhesions and motility during initial
delamination of NCCs from the neuroepithelium. Recent studies have revealed
multiple functions for these molecules and suggest that a precise balance of
their activity is crucial. RhoGTPase appears to regulate both cell adhesions and 
protrusive forces during NCC delamination. Increasing evidence shows that
cadherins are multi-functional proteins with novel, adhesion-independent
signaling functions that control NCC motility during both delamination and
migration. These functions are often regulated by specific proteolytic cleavage
of cadherins. After NCC delamination, planar cell polarity signaling acts via
RhoGTPases to control NCC protrusions and migration direction.

Sex steroid hormones exert a profound influence on the sexual differentiation and
function of the neural circuits that mediate dimorphic behaviors. Both estrogen
and testosterone are essential for male typical behaviors in many species. Recent
studies with genetically modified mice provide important new insights into the
logic whereby these two hormones coordinate the display of sexually dimorphic
behaviors: estrogen sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual and territorial
behaviors and testosterone controls the extent of these male displays.

Richness of neural circuits and specificity of neuronal connectivity depend on
the diversification of nerve cells into functionally and molecularly distinct
subtypes. Although efficient methods for directed differentiation of embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) into multiple principal neuronal classes have been established,
only a few studies systematically examined the subtype diversity of in vitro
derived nerve cells. Here we review evidence based on molecular and in vivo
transplantation studies that ESC-derived spinal motor neurons and cortical layer 
V pyramidal neurons acquire subtype specific functional properties. We discuss
similarities and differences in the role of cell-intrinsic transcriptional
programs, extrinsic signals and cell-cell interactions during subtype
diversification of the two classes of nerve cells. We conclude that the high
degree of fidelity with which differentiating ESCs recapitulate normal embryonic 
development provides a unique opportunity to explore developmental processes
underlying specification of mammalian neuronal diversity in a simplified and
experimentally accessible system.

The developmental potential of stem cells and progenitor cells must be
functionally distinguished to ensure the generation of diverse cell types while
maintaining the stem cell pool throughout the lifetime of an organism. In
contrast to stem cells, progenitor cells possess restricted developmental
potential, allowing them to give rise to only a limited number of post-mitotic
progeny. Failure to establish or maintain restricted progenitor cell potential
can perturb tissue development and homeostasis, and probably contributes to tumor
initiation. Recent studies using the developing fruit fly Drosophila larval brain
have provided molecular insight into how the developmental potential is
restricted in neural progenitor cells.

Neural circuits underlying complex learned behaviors, such as speech in humans,
develop under genetic constraints and in response to environmental influences.
Little is known about the rules and mechanisms through which such circuits form. 
We argue that songbirds, with their discrete and well studied neural pathways
underlying a complex and naturally learned behavior, provide a powerful model for
addressing these questions. We briefly review current knowledge of how the song
circuit develops during learning and discuss new possibilities for advancing the 
field given recent technological advances.

The coordination and timing of muscle activities during rhythmic movements, like 
walking and swimming, are generated by intrinsic spinal motor circuits. Such
locomotor networks are operational early in development and are found in all
vertebrates. This review outlines and compares recent advances that have revealed
the developmental and functional organization of these fundamental spinal motor
networks in limbed and non-limbed animals. The comparison will highlight common
principles and divergence in the organization of the spinal locomotor network
structure in these different species as well as point to unresolved issues
regarding the assembly and functioning of these networks.

Neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are composed of a variety of sensory
modalities, three of which are pain-sensing nociceptors, temperature-sensing
thermoceptors, and itch-sensing pruriceptors. All these neurons are emerged from 
a common pool of embryonic DRG neurons that are marked by the expression of the
neurotrophin receptor TrkA. Here we discuss how intrinsic transcription factors
interface with target-derived signals to specify these functionally distinct
sensory neurons. We will also discuss how this control mechanism provides a
developmental perspective for the coding of somatic sensations.

The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has recently provided new insights
into the roles of various proteins in neurodegenerative diseases including
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), and Huntington's Disease
(HD). Several developmental signaling pathways including WNT, MAPK and BMP/TGF-β 
signaling play important roles in the formation and growth of the Drosophila NMJ.
Studies of the fly homologues of genes that cause neurodegenerative disease at
the NMJ have resulted in a better understanding of the roles of these proteins in
vivo. These studies may shed light on the pathological mechanisms of these
diseases, with implications for reduced BMP/TGF-β signaling in ALS, SMA and HD
and increased signaling in HSP and MS.

Dendritic spines are small actin-rich protrusions on the surface of dendrites
whose morphological and molecular plasticity play key roles in learning and
memory. Both the form and function of spines are critically dependent on the
actin cytoskeleton. However, new research, using electron microscopy and
live-cell super-resolution microscopy indicates that the actin cytoskeleton is
more complex and dynamic than originally thought. Also, exciting recent studies
from several labs indicate that microtubules, once thought to be restricted to
the dendrite shaft, can make excursions into the most distal regions of dendritic
spines. Moreover, microtubule invasions of spines appear to be associated with
changes in synaptic activity. Thus, it is likely that dynamic interactions
between microtubules and actin filaments within dendritic spines play important
roles in dendritic spine plasticity.

Trans-cellular communication relies on a complex interplay of cell-cell adhesion 
and signaling induced by diffusible molecules. This is particularly evident for
neuron-glia interaction in the nervous system. The small, relative number of
glial cells in combination with well-established genetic techniques predestines
Drosophila as a powerful model to dissect the molecular basis of neuron-glia
interaction. We are discussing homophilic and heterophilic adhesion systems that 
ensure proper interaction of neurons and glial cells as well as prominent
signaling cascades regulating various aspects of coordinated neuron-glial
development. The combination of these results in instructive signals governing
proper nervous system development and function.

Axon regeneration has long been studied in vertebrate model organisms and
neuronal cultures. Recent development of axon regeneration paradigms in genetic
model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish, has
opened an exciting field for in vivo functional dissection of regeneration
pathways. Studies in these organisms have discovered essential genes and pathways
for axon regrowth. The conservation of these genes crossing animal phyla suggests
mechanistic relevance to higher organisms. The power of genetic approaches in
these organisms makes large-scale genetic and pharmacological screens feasible
and can greatly accelerate the mechanistic understanding of axon regeneration.

A number of synaptogenic factors induce presynaptic or postsynaptic
differentiation when presented to axons or dendrites. Many such factors
participate in bidirectional trans-synaptic adhesion complexes. Axonal neurexins 
interacting in an isoform-specific code with multiple dendritic partners
(neuroligins, LRRTMs, or Cbln-GluRδ), and axonal protein tyrosine phosphatase
receptors interacting with dendritic NGL-3, nucleate local networks of
high-affinity protein-protein interactions leading to aligned presynaptic and
postsynaptic differentiation. Additional secreted target-derived factors such as 
fibroblast growth factors and glial-derived factors such as thrombospondin bind
specific axonal or dendritic receptors stimulating signal transduction mechanisms
to promote selective aspects of synapse development. Together with classical
adhesion molecules and controlled by transcriptional cascades, these synaptogenic
adhesion complexes and secreted factors organize the molecular composition and
thus functional properties of central synapses.

The term neurodevelopmental disorder encompasses a wide range of diseases,
including recognizably distinct syndromes known to be caused by very rare
mutations in specific genes or chromosomal loci, and also much more common
disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and idiopathic
epilepsy and mental retardation. After decades of frustration, the past couple of
years have suddenly seen tremendous progress in unravelling the genetics of these
common disorders. These findings have led to a paradigm shift in our conception
of the genetic architecture of common neurodevelopmental disease, highlighting
the importance of individual, rare mutations and overlapping genetic aetiology of
various disorders. They have also converged on specific neurodevelopmental
pathways, providing insights into pathogenic mechanisms.

The presynaptic active zone (AZ) membrane is the site where vesicle fusion
mediates information transfer between connected neurons. Reaching into the
cytoplasm, an electron-dense cytomatrix (CAZ) is found to decorate the AZ
membranes. CAZ architectures are meant not only to regulate the synaptic vesicle 
exocycle/endocycle, but also to structurally stabilize the presynaptic site. The 
CAZ is composed of a set of large scaffold proteins, many of which are
evolutionarily conserved. Recently, several signaling factors controlling the
developmental assembly of CAZs were found by unbiased genetics in Drosophila and 
Caenorhabditis elegans. At the same time, post-translational modification of CAZ 
proteins was implicated in changing the strength of mammalian brain synapses.
Studying how processes of structural and functional CAZ plasticity get integrated
within circuit remodeling remains an important challenge.

For decades, microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, have been
recognized mostly for their role in several, if not all, pathologies affecting
the brain. However, several studies under physiological conditions demonstrate
that microglial function is indispensable also in the healthy brain. Indeed,
microglia implement key functions already during development, such as the
clearance of the huge amount of neurons that are produced in large excess in the 
embryo and later die of apoptosis. Beside these classical functions, however,
novel roles are emerging that strikingly link microglia with higher order brain
functions and show that these cells can ultimately influence behaviour. Therefore
a detailed understanding of microglia under physiological conditions may open
unprecedented perspectives in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric
diseases.

Neural circuit assembly during development involves a series of highly regulated 
steps. While genetically pre-determined programs play key roles in the early
steps including neurogenesis, migration, and initial growth and guidance of
axons; increasing evidence indicates that as the axons reach their targets, the
late steps of neuronal differentiation and connectivity formation may be
influenced or even specified by target-derived signals. Here we attempt to
provide a brief synthesized review on the roles of retrograde neurotrophin and
growth factor signaling in regulating the final stages of neural circuit
specificity such as axonal projection, dendritic patterning, neurotransmitter
phenotype acquisition, and synapse formation.

Research, The Ridgeway, NW7 1AA London, United Kingdom.

The ability of vertebrates and insects to perceive and process information about 
the visual world is mediated by neural circuits, which share a strikingly
conserved architecture of reiterated columnar and layered synaptic units. Recent 
genetic approaches conferring single-cell resolution have enabled major advances 
in our understanding of the cellular and molecular strategies that orchestrate
visual circuit assembly in Drosophila. Photoreceptor axon targeting relies on a
sequence of interdependent developmental steps to achieve temporal coordination
with the formation and maturation of partner neurons. Distinct targeting events
depend on anterograde and autocrine signaling, neuron-glia interactions, axon
tiling and the timely expression of homophilic cell surface molecules. These
mediate local adhesive or repulsive interactions of photoreceptor axons with each
other and with target neurons.

Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites of the majority of excitatory
synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. The morphology and dynamics of 
dendritic spines change throughout the lifespan of animals, in response to novel 
experiences and neuropathologies. New spines form rapidly as animals learn new
tasks or experience novel sensory stimulations. This is followed by a selective
elimination of previously existing spines, leading to significant synaptic
remodeling. In the brain damaged by injuries or neurological diseases, spines in 
surviving cortical regions turn over substantially, potentially forming new
synaptic connections to adopt the function lost in the damaged region. These
findings suggest that spine plasticity plays important roles in the formation and
maintenance of a functional neural circuitry.

In the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), specialized glial and neuronal
cells positioned at the dorsal and ventral midline act as intermediate targets
for commissural axons by secreting a variety of attractants and repellents.
Despite the diversity of commissural projections, recent findings suggest that
the same basic set of molecules controls midline crossing at all level of the
CNS. Midline crossing is associated with an important switch of the combinatorial
expression of several axon guidance receptors on the growth cone of commissural
axons. I will review here novel studies that reveal how the expression of these
receptors and the activity of their ligands are modulated by transcriptional,
translational, and post-translational modifications. This also uncovers extensive
cross talks between axon guidance pathways.

Spatial and non-spatial functions of the parietal cortex.

Gottlieb J(1), Snyder LH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, USA. jg2141@columbia.edu

Although the parietal cortex is traditionally associated with spatial attention
and sensorimotor integration, recent evidence also implicates it in higher order 
cognitive functions. We review relevant results from neuron recording studies
showing that inferior parietal neurons integrate information regarding target
location with a variety of non-spatial signals. Some of these signals are
modulatory and alter a stimulus-evoked response according to the action,
category, or reward associated with the stimulus. Other non-spatial inputs act
independently, encoding the context or rules of a task even before the
presentation of a specific target. Despite the ubiquity of non-spatial
information in individual neurons, reversible inactivation of the parietal lobe
affects only spatial orienting of attention and gaze, but not non-spatial aspects
of performance. This suggests that non-spatial signals contribute to an
underlying spatial computation, possibly allowing the brain to determine which
targets are worthy of attention or action in a given task context.

Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) were originally developed to give severely motor
impaired patients a method to communicate and interact with their environment.
Initially most BCI systems were based on non-invasive electroencephalographic
recordings from the surface of the scalp. To increase control speed, accuracy and
complexity, researchers began utilizing invasive recording modalities. BCIs using
multi-single unit action potentials have provided elegant multi-dimensional
control of both computer cursors and robotic limbs in the last few years.
However, long-term stability issues with single-unit arrays has lead researchers 
to investigate other invasive recording modalities such as high-frequency local
field potentials and electrocorticography (ECoG). Although ECoG originally
evolved as a replacement for single-unit BCIs, it has come full circle to become 
an effective tool for studying cortical neurophysiology.

Interest in Drosophila courtship behavior has a long-standing tradition, starting
with the works by Sturtevant in 1915, and by Bastock and Manning in the 50s. The 
neural and genetic base of Drosophila melanogaster courtship behavior has made
big strides in recent years, but the studies on males far outnumber those on
females. Recent technical developments have made it possible to begin to unravel 
the biological substrates underlying the complexity of Drosophila female sexual
behavior and its decisive effect on mating success. The present review focus more
on the female side and summarizes the sensory signals that the male sends, using 
multiple channels, and which neural circuits and genes are mediating sex-specific
behavioral responses.

Recent large-scale genetic studies have provided robust evidence implicating
several novel susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. These include ZNF804A, TCF4
and NRGN, which contain common variants that weakly increase schizophrenia
susceptibility, and NRXN1, in which rare copy number variants have a greater
impact on schizophrenia risk. Investigation of these and other substantiated
susceptibility genes are providing valuable insight into the primary
neurobiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, which may lead to novel
therapeutic interventions for the disorder. In the meantime, several novel
pharmacological strategies, including activation of mGluRs, elevation of synaptic
glycine and inhibition of phosphodiesterase 10A, have recently shown promise for 
the treatment of schizophrenia in clinical trials.

Sex differences in the nervous system are found throughout the animal kingdom.
Here, we discuss three prominent genetic models: nematodes, fruit flies, and
mice. In all three, differential cell death is central to sexual differentiation 
and shared molecular mechanisms have been identified. Our knowledge of the
precise function of neural sex differences lags behind. One fruitful approach to 
the 'function' question is to contrast sexual differentiation in standard
laboratory animals with differentiation in species exhibiting unique social and
reproductive organizations. Advanced genetic strategies are also addressing this 
question in worms and flies, and may soon be applicable to vertebrates.

Corticospinal interactions are considered to play a key role in executing
voluntary movements. Nonetheless several different studies have shown directly
and indirectly that these interactions take place long before movement starts,
when preparation for forthcoming movements dominates. When motor-related
parameters are continuously processed in several premotor cortical sites,
segmental circuitry is directly exposed to this processing via descending
pathways which originate from these sites in parallel to descending fibers that
derive from primary motor cortex. Recent studies have highlighted the functional 
role of these interactions in priming downstream elements for the ensuing motor
actions. Time-resolved analysis has further emphasized the dynamic properties of 
pre-movement preparatory activity.

Both medical and evolutionary genetics increasingly emphasize the importance of
subtle, quantitative measures of phenotype. One such 'endophenotype,' the
distribution of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR), is a recent focus for studies of 
social behavior. In animal studies, the neural distribution of V1aR has been
linked to both social attachment and patterns of sexual fidelity. At a genetic
level, a microsatellite in the cis-regulatory region of the avpr1a locus has been
linked to variation in both brain and behavior. Both sets of data become more
complex as the mechanistic and evolutionary details are examined more fully. I
briefly summarize recent work from animal and human studies of avpr1a and
highlight parallels between comparative and clinical approaches.

Acoustic communication is the major component of social behavior in anuran
amphibians (frogs and toads) and has served as a neuroethological model for the
nervous system's processing of social signals related to mate choice decisions.
The male's advertisement or mating call is its most conspicuous social signal,
and the nervous system's analysis of the call is a progressive process. As
processing proceeds through neural systems, response properties become more
specific to the signal and, in addition, neural activity gradually shifts from
representing sensory (auditory periphery and brainstem) to sensorimotor
(diencephalon) to motor (forebrain) components of a behavioral response. A
comparative analysis of many anuran species shows that the first stage in biasing
responses toward conspecific signals over heterospecific signals, and toward
particular features of conspecific signals, lies in the tuning of the peripheral 
auditory system. Biases in processing signals are apparent through the brainstem 
auditory system, where additional feature detection neurons are added by the time
processing reaches the level of the midbrain. Recent work using immediate early
gene expression as a marker of neural activity suggests that by the level of the 
midbrain and forebrain, the differential neural representation of conspecific and
heterospecific signals involves both changes in mean activity levels across
multiple subnuclei, and in the functional correlations among acoustically active 
areas. Our data show that in frogs the auditory midbrain appears to play an
important role in controlling behavioral responses to acoustic social signals by 
acting as a regulatory gateway between the stimulus analysis of the brainstem and
the behavioral and physiological control centers of the forebrain. We predict
that this will hold true for other vertebrate groups such as birds and fish that 
produce acoustic social signals, and perhaps also in fish where electroreception 
or vibratory sensing through the lateral line systems plays a role in social
signaling, as in all these cases ascending sensory information converges onto
midbrain nuclei which relay information to higher brain centers.

The roles of the basal ganglia (BG) in motor control are much debated. Many
influential hypotheses have grown from studies in which output signals of the BG 
were not blocked, but pathologically disturbed. A weakness of that approach is
that the resulting behavioral impairments reflect degraded function of the BG per
se mixed together with secondary dysfunctions of BG-recipient brain areas. To
overcome that limitation, several studies have focused on the main skeletomotor
output region of the BG, the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Using single-cell
recording and inactivation protocols these studies provide consistent support for
two hypotheses: the BG modulates movement performance ('vigor') according to
motivational factors (i.e. context-specific cost/reward functions) and the BG
contributes to motor learning. Results from these studies also add to the
problems that confront theories positing that the BG selects movement, inhibits
unwanted motor responses, corrects errors on-line, or stores and produces
well-learned motor skills.

Nonapeptide mechanisms of social cognition, behavior and species-specific social 
systems.

Nonapeptide functions have been explored in a diverse literature that has
burgeoned in recent years, particularly in relation to affiliation, bonding and
human social cognition. However, brain distributions of the oxytocin-like and
vasopressin-like peptides are fundamentally similar across all vertebrate
animals, including many species that do not exhibit social bonds, grouping, or
even parent-offspring interaction. Hence, unifying principles extend beyond, and 
may even constrain, nonapeptide effects on social cognition and behavior.
Conversely, nonapeptide receptor distributions are highly species-specific,
suggesting almost limitless functional variation. Drawing on the vast recent
literature, we here present a phylogenetically integrated review of both
ubiquitous vertebrate features and species diversity, highlighting important
nonapeptide effects on socially relevant physiology, sensorimotor integration,
assignment of valence, and functional connectivity.

Social status hierarchy is a ubiquitous principle of social organization across
the animal kingdom. Recent findings in social neuroscience reveal distinct neural
networks associated with the recognition and experience of social hierarchy in
humans, as well as modulation of these networks by personality and culture.
Additionally, allelic variation in the serotonin transporter gene is associated
with prevalence of social hierarchy across species and cultures, suggesting the
importance of the study of genetic factors underlying social hierarchy. Future
studies are needed to determine how genetic and environmental factors shape
neural systems involved in the production and maintenance of social hierarchy
across ontogeny and phylogeny.

What makes males and females behave differently? Although genetic
master-regulators commonly underlie physical differences, sexually dimorphic
behavior is additionally influenced by sensory input such as olfactory cues.
Olfaction requires both ligands for signaling and sensory neural circuits for
detection. Specialized subsets of each interact to generate gender-dimorphic
behavior. It has long been accepted that males and females emit sex-specific odor
compounds that function as pheromones to promote stereotypic behavior.
Significant advances have now been made in purifying and isolating several of
these sex-specific olfactory ligands. In contrast, the neural mechanisms that
enable a gender-dimorphic response to these odors remain largely unknown.
However, first progress has been made in identifying components of sexually
dimorphic olfactory circuits in both Drosophila and the mouse.

Control of movements and temporal discounting of reward.

Let us assume that the purpose of any movement is to position our body in a more 
rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a function of
time. Recent results suggest that there is a correlation between changes in this 
reward temporal discount function and changes in saccadic velocity and duration. 
These results suggest that each movement carries a cost because its duration
delays acquisition of reward. The value that the brain assigns to the stimulus,
and the rate at which it discounts this value in time, form a cost that appears
to influence the motor commands that move our body.

Shedding new light on the role of the basal ganglia-superior colliculus pathway
in eye movements.

A large body of work spanning 25+ years provides compelling evidence for the
involvement of the basal ganglia-superior colliculus pathway in the initiation of
rapid, orienting movements of the eyes, called saccades. The role of this pathway
in saccade control is similar to the role of the basal ganglia-thalamic pathway
in the control of skeletal movement: a transient cessation in tonic inhibition
supplied by the basal ganglia to motor structures releases movements via the
direct pathway whereas a transient increase in inhibition by the basal ganglia to
motor structures prevents movements via the indirect pathway. In parallel with
recent advances in the study and treatment of patients with basal ganglia disease
and in animal experiments in the skeletal motor system, the results of studies
exploring the role of the basal ganglia-superior colliculus pathway in saccades
highlight the need for a revisiting of our understanding of the role of this
pathway in saccades. The discovery of many different response profiles of neurons
in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of the basal ganglia and in the superior 
colliculus, coupled with advances in experimental and statistical techniques
including sophisticated behavioral procedures and multiple neuron recording and
analysis, point toward a role for the basal ganglia-superior colliculus pathway
in cognitive events intervening between vision and action, such as memory, target
selection and saccade choice and valuation.

This review will focus on recent developments in the sensorimotor integration of 
vocal communication. Two broad themes are emphasized: the evolution of vocal
production and perception, and the role of social context. Advances include: a
proposal for the emergence of vocal patterning during vertebrate evolution, the
role of sensory mechanisms such as categorical perception in decoding
communication signals, contributions of sensorimotor integration phenomena
including mirror neurons and vocal learning, and mechanisms of hormone-dependent 
plasticity in both auditory and vocal systems. Transcriptional networks activated
in humans but not in chimps by the FoxP2 gene suggest molecular mechanisms
underlying vocal gestures and the emergence of human language.

Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) assist retinal image stabilization during
vertebrate locomotion thereby ensuring accurate visual perception. The importance
of this motor behavior for animal survival requires that the underlying circuitry
and all individual components are fully developed and functional as soon as
post-embryonic animals initiate self-motion. Recent progress on the genetic,
molecular, and activity-dependent regulation of placode development, vestibular
sensory organ formation, circuit assembly, and acquisition of neuronal properties
revealed rules and restrictions that give insight into how hindbrain VOR neuronal
networks are assembled and become functional during ontogeny. Major crucial steps
that correlate with early/delayed functional VOR onsets concern the maturation of
cellular properties (precocial/altricial species) and the acquisition of minimal 
semicircular canal dimensions (small-sized vertebrates).

Understanding the complexity of neuronal biology requires the manipulation of
cellular processes with high specificity and spatio-temporal precision. The
recent development of synthetic photo-activatable proteins designed using the
light-oxygen-voltage and phytochrome domains provides a new set of tools for
genetically targeted optical control of cell signaling. Their modular design,
functional diversity, precisely controlled activity and in vivo applicability
offer many advantages for investigating neuronal function. Although designing
these proteins is still a considerable challenge, future advances in rational
protein design and a deeper understanding of their photoactivation mechanisms
will allow the development of the next generation of optogenetic techniques.

Reconstructing neuronal circuits at the level of synapses is a central problem in
neuroscience, and the focus of the nascent field of connectomics. Previously used
to reconstruct the C. elegans wiring diagram, serial-section transmission
electron microscopy (ssTEM) is a proven technique for the task. However, to
reconstruct more complex circuits, ssTEM will require the automation of image
processing. We review progress in the processing of electron microscopy images
and, in particular, a semi-automated reconstruction pipeline deployed at Janelia 
Farm. Drosophila circuits underlying identified behaviors are being reconstructed
in the pipeline with the goal of generating a complete Drosophila connectome.

Connections between neurons can be found by checking whether synapses exist at
points of contact, which in turn are determined by neural shapes. Finding these
shapes is a special case of image segmentation, which is laborious for humans and
would ideally be performed by computers. New metrics properly quantify the
performance of a computer algorithm using its disagreement with 'true'
segmentations of example images. New machine learning methods search for
segmentation algorithms that minimize such metrics. These advances have reduced
computer errors dramatically. It should now be faster for a human to correct the 
remaining errors than to segment an image manually. Further reductions in human
effort are expected, and crucial for finding connectomes more complex than that
of Caenorhabditis elegans.

The precise spatial and temporal control afforded by microfluidic devices make
them uniquely suited as experimental tools for cellular neuroscience.
Micro-structures have been developed to direct the placement of cells and small
organisms within a device. Microfluidics can precisely define pharmacological
microenvironments, mimicking conditions found in vivo with the advantage of
defined parameters which are usually difficult to control and manipulate in vivo.
These devices are compatible with high-resolution microscopy, are simple to
assemble, and are reproducible. In this review we will focus on microfluidic
devices that have recently been developed for small, whole organisms such as C.
elegans and dissociated cultured neurons. These devices have improved control
over the placement of cells or organisms and allowed unprecedented experimental
access, enabling novel investigations in neurobiology.

The recent invention of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy brings more than
an order of magnitude gain in the spatial resolution of light microscopy. New
opportunities keep emerging with the multicolor, three-dimensional, and live
imaging functionalities gained in the past three years. The power of this
technology has been demonstrated by imaging the organization of organelles and
molecular complexes, with recent applications increasingly showing its potential 
in neurobiology. These developments are exemplified by the visualization of
components inside dendritic spines to fine morphologies of neurons. In
combination with correlative electron microscopy, functional imaging, and
electrical/optogenetic stimulation tools, super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy has the potential to provide further insights ranging from the
molecular details of neurons up to the functional mechanisms of neuronal
circuits.

Functional polarity in neurons: what can we learn from studying an exception?

Carnegie Mellon University, USA.

Dendrites and axons typically handle very different aspects of neuronal
signaling. However, many of the functional distinctions between these two types
of processes are absent in neurons with release-competent dendrites. This raises 
fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms that promote and permit
functional specialization, and suggests that the 'exceptional' case of
presynaptic dendrites may provide important clues on how neuronal polarity is
established. To help stimulate thinking on this new front, we summarize some key 
aspects of the physiology of dendritic neurotransmitter release, together with
recent work on the molecular basis of neuronal polarity.

Microglial cells constitute the resident immune cell population of the mammalian 
central nervous system. One striking feature of these cells is their highly
dynamic nature under both normal and pathological brain conditions. The highly
branched processes of resting microglia display a constitutive mobility and
undergo rapid directional movement towards sites of acute tissue disruption.
Microglia can be converted by a large number of different stimuli to a
chronically activated state by signaling through both purinergic and Toll-like
receptor systems, among others. Recent work has uncovered some of the mechanisms 
underlying microglia dynamics and shed new light into the functional significance
of this enigmatic member of the glial cell family.

The discovery of the light-gated cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and the
use of the rediscovered light-driven Cl-pump halorhodopsin (HR) as optogenetic
tools--genetically encoded switches that enable neurons to be turned on or off
with bursts of light--refines the functional study of neurons in larger networks.
Cell-specific expression allows a fast optical scanning approach to determine
neuronal crosstalk following plasticity at the single synapse level or long-range
projections in locomotion and somatosensory networks. Both rhodopsins proved to
work functionally and could evoke behavioral responses in lower model organisms, 
reinstall rudimentary visual perception in blind mice and were set in a
biomedical context with the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous membrane system comprising the
nuclear envelope, polyribosome-studded peripheral sheets, and a polygonal network
of smooth tubules extending throughout the cell. Though protein biosynthesis,
transport, and quality control in the ER have been extensively studied,
mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous architecture of the ER have been
clarified more recently. These insights have increased interest in ER morphology 
changes associated with the development of neuronal axons and dendrites as well
as their integration with presynaptic and postsynaptic signaling pathways. A
number of proteins involved in shaping and distributing the ER network are
mutated in neurological disorders, particularly the hereditary spastic
paraplegias, emphasizing the importance of proper ER morphology for the
establishment and maintenance of highly polarized neurons.

Almost 30 years ago, actin was identified as the major cytoskeletal component of 
dendritic spines. Since then, its role in the remarkable dynamics of spine
morphology have been detailed with live-cell views establishing that spine shape 
dynamics are an important requirement for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity.
However, the actin cytoskeleton is critical to numerous and varied processes
within the spine which contribute to the maintenance and plasticity of synaptic
function. Here, we argue that the spatial and temporal distribution of
actin-dependent processes within spines suggests that the spine cytoskeleton
should not be considered a single entity, but an interacting network of nodes or 
hubs that are independently regulated and balanced to maintain synapse function. 
Disruptions of this balance within the spine are likely to lead to psychiatric
and neurological dysfunction.

Astrocytes, one of the most numerous types of cells in the central nervous
system, are crucial for potassium homeostasis, neurotransmitter uptake, synapse
formation, regulation of blood-brain-barrier, and the development of the nervous 
system. Historically, astrocytes have been studied as a homogeneous group of
cells. However, evidence has accumulated that suggests heterogeneity of
astrocytes across brain regions as well as within the same brain regions.
Astrocytes differ in their morphology, developmental origin, gene expression
profile, physiological properties, function, and response to injury and disease. 
A better understanding of the heterogeneity of astrocytes will greatly aid
investigation of the function of astrocytes in normal brain as well as the roles 
of astrocytes in neurological disorders.

A fundamental feature of membranes is the lateral diffusion of lipids and
proteins. Control of lateral diffusion provides a mechanism for regulating the
structure and function of synapses. Single-particle tracking (SPT) has emerged as
a powerful way to directly visualize these movements. SPT can reveal complex
diffusive behaviors, which can be regulated by neuronal activity over time and
space. Such is the case for neurotransmitter receptors, which are transiently
stabilized at synapses by scaffolding molecules. This regulation provides new
insight into mechanisms by which the dynamic equilibrium of receptor-scaffold
assembly can be regulated. We will briefly review here recent data on this
mechanism, which ultimately tunes the number of receptors at synapses and
therefore synaptic strength.

Recent technological advances have led to new light-weight battery-operated
systems for electrophysiology. Such systems are head mounted, run for days
without experimenter intervention, and can record and stimulate from single or
multiple electrodes implanted in a freely behaving primate. Here we discuss
existing systems, studies that use them, and how they can augment traditional,
physically restrained, 'in-rig' electrophysiology. With existing technical
capabilities, these systems can acquire multiple signal classes, such as spikes, 
local field potential, and electromyography signals, and can stimulate based on
real-time processing of recorded signals. Moving forward, this class of
technologies, along with advances in neural signal processing and behavioral
monitoring, have the potential to dramatically expand the scope and scale of
electrophysiological studies.

Chemical neurotransmission between neurons is a major point for modulation of
neuronal activity. The neuronal synapse is the site of continuous cycles of rapid
vesicle fusion (exocytosis) followed by their retrieval (endocytosis). Ongoing
research efforts are largely focused on synaptic proteins involved in membrane
fusion-and-fission, but it is now becoming clear that the dynamic lipid
environment, where these proteins operate, also plays a key role in the
modulation of chemical transmission. Growing evidence suggests that lipid
metabolites regulate both vesicle fusion and retrieval highlighting the fact that
membrane lipids have functions beyond the structural role. Furthermore, direct
involvement of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, necessitates rigorous
investigation of the effects of lipids on synaptic mechanisms. Recent findings
and possible lines of further investigation will be discussed in this review.

Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized cell biology and, therefore, our
understanding of the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms that wire the
brain together and enable its plasticity throughout life. The ability to
visualize cell biological processes has inspired the development of alternative
protein labeling strategies by both chemists and biologists. Among those
approaches are the introduction of small bioorthogonal chemical reporters and new
fluorescent probes by either genetic encoding or by utilizing the cell's own
biosynthesis machinery in live cells. This review will highlight recent advances 
in approaches to track discrete proteins or whole subpopulations of a proteome
including post-translational modifications with spatiotemporal resolution.

Fast synaptic inhibition is largely mediated by GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs),
ligand-gated chloride channels that play an essential role in the control of cell
and network activity in the brain. Recent work has demonstrated that the
delivery, number and stability of GABA(A)Rs at inhibitory synapses play a key
role in the dynamic regulation of inhibitory synaptic efficacy and plasticity.
The regulatory pathways essential for the fine-tuning of synaptic inhibition have
also emerged as key sites of vulnerability during pathological changes in cell
excitability in disease states.

Recently, stable labeling techniques and use of two-photon microscopy for deep
tissue imaging have enabled observation of neuronal structural dynamics within
intact cerebral cortical circuits. These studies demonstrate that while neuronal 
structures are predominantly stable in the adult, a fraction of dendrites and
axons are highly dynamic and responsive to experience, remodeling with precise
cell type and laminar specificity. The qualitative and quantitative features of
dendritic spine, dendritic branch, and axonal remodeling suggest that their
purpose may be to provide access to and alter connectivity between different
circuits in cortical space. The net number of synapses lost or gained during
arbor remodeling may not be as important as the change to the circuit diagram
resulting from the shuffling of synaptic partners.

A new look at calcium channel α2δ subunits.

London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.

The classical roles of α(2)δ proteins are as accessory calcium channel subunits, 
enhancing channel trafficking. They were thought to have type-I transmembrane
topology, but we find that they can form GPI-anchored proteins. Moreover α(2)δ-1 
and α(2)δ-3 have been shown to have novel functions in synaptogenesis,
independent of their effect on calcium channels. In neurons, the α(2)δ-1 subunits
are present mainly in presynaptic terminals. Peripheral sensory nerve injury
results in the up-regulation of α(2)δ-1 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons,
and there is a consequent increase in trafficking of α(2)δ-1 to their terminals. 
Furthermore, gabapentinoid drugs, which bind to α(2)δ-1 and α(2)δ-2, not only
impair their trafficking, but also affect α(2)δ-1-dependent synaptogenesis. These
drugs may interfere with α(2)δ function at several different levels.

The successful transduction of action potentials along vertebrate axons is highly
reliant on myelin, the concentric layers of membrane surrounding most large
diameter axons. Within the central nervous system myelin is produced by
oligodendrocytes. Developmentally, the oligodendrocyte linage arises from
subventricular zone progenitors that give rise to oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells (OPCs), which divide and migrate throughout the CNS before terminally
differentiating to generate mature oligodendrocytes which myelinate receptive
axons. Each step of progression along the lineage is under tight transcriptional 
control, elucidation of this control is vital for understanding developmental
myelination and for developing strategies to promote repair in demyelinating
diseases. Recent studies have identified a number of new transcriptional
regulators and microRNAs as having key roles in CNS myelination.

Planar cell polarity (PCP), the organization of cell sheets in the tangential
plane, is regulated by a set of 'core' PCP genes. Over the last few years,
evidence has accumulated that PCP signaling is important for brain development
and function. PCP signaling in the neuroepithelium and otic placode controls
neural tube closure, the organization of inner ear sensory cells and probably
neural stem cell divisions. PCP signaling also acts in postmitotic neurons, and
regulates neuronal migration, axon guidance as well as neuronal maturation and
survival. Although several key players in PCP signaling have been identified,
their mechanisms of action remain elusive, particularly in the nervous system.

Microglia are increasingly recognized as critical in the pathogenesis of pain
hypersensitivity caused by injury to peripheral nerves. The core signalling
pathway is through P2X4 purinergic receptors on the microglia which, via the
release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cause disinhibition of nociceptive 
dorsal horn neurons by raising intracellular chloride levels. This disinhibition 
works in synergy with enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission in the dorsal
horn to transform the output of the nociceptive network. There is increased
discharge output, unmasking of responses to innocuous peripheral inputs and
spontaneous activity in neurons that otherwise only signal nociception. Together 
the changes caused by microglia-neuron signalling may account for the main
symptoms of neuropathic pain in humans.

The conventional view of dendritic function is that dendrites collect synaptic
input and deliver it to the soma. This view has been challenged in recent years
by new results demonstrating that dendrites can act as independent processing and
signalling units, performing local computations that are then broadcast to the
rest of the neuron, or to other neurons via dendritic transmitter and
neuromodulator release. Here we describe these findings and discuss the notion
that the single dendritic branch may represent a fundamental unit of signalling
in the mammalian nervous system. This view proposes that the dendritic branch is 
a basic organizational unit for integrating synaptic input, implementing synaptic
and homeostatic plasticity, and controlling local cellular processes such as
protein translation.

Plasticity of voltage-gated ion channels in pyramidal cell dendrites.

Dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate multiple synaptic inputs and transform
them into axonal action potential output. This fundamental process is controlled 
by a variety of dendritic channels. The properties of dendritic ion channels are 
not static but can be modified by neuronal activity. Activity-dependent changes
in the density, localization, or biophysical properties of dendritic
voltage-gated channels can persistently alter the integration of synaptic inputs.
Furthermore, dendritic intrinsic plasticity can induce neuronal output mode
transitions (e.g. from regular spiking to burst firing). Recent advances in the
field reviewed here represent an important step toward uncovering the principles 
of neuronal input/output transformations in response to various patterns of brain
activity.

The axon initial segment is a unique neuronal subregion involved in the
initiation of action potentials and in the control of axonal identity. Recent
work has helped our understanding of how this specialised structure develops, not
least in identifying possible mechanisms leading to the localisation of the AIS's
master organiser protein, ankyrin-G. The most exciting current work, however,
focuses on later aspects of AIS function and plasticity. Recent studies have
shown that the AIS is subdivided into distinct structural and functional domains,
have demonstrated how the AIS acts as a cytoplasmic barrier for axonal transport,
and have discovered that the AIS can be surprisingly plastic in its responses to 
alterations in neuronal activity.

essential cues from different sources inform the axon to define the presynaptic

Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain continuously supply new neurons to
the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the olfactory bulb (OB). Recent studies
indicate that the progression from neural precursor cells (NPCs) to mature
neurons is tightly controlled by coordinate cell-intrinsic programs and external 
signals within the neurogenic niche. In this review, we summarize both classes of
regulatory factors involved in distinct stages of adult neurogenesis, including
proliferation and lineage differentiation of NSCs, migration of neuroblasts and
integration of newborn neurons. A full understanding of the wide variety of
signaling pathways will ultimately provide precise targets for therapeutic
applications.

By forming close contacts with synapses, astrocytes secrete neuroactive
substances and remove neurotransmitters, thus influencing the processing of
information by the nervous system. Here, we review recent work on astrocytes and 
their roles in regulating neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Astrocytes
are organized as networks and communicate with each other, thereby affecting
larger neural circuits. They also provide a link between neurons and the
vasculature, potentially changing the cerebral microcirculation. Recent work has 
provided insights into the relative contributions of specific astrocytic cues and
transporters to synaptic transmission, plasticity, and animal behavior.

Sexual differentiation and development of forebrain reproductive circuits.

Semaan SJ(1), Kauffman AS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La
Jolla, CA, USA.

Males and females exhibit numerous anatomical and physiological differences in
the brain that often underlie important sex differences in physiology or
behavior, including aspects relating to reproduction. Neural sex differences are 
both region-specific and trait-specific and may consist of divergences in synapse
morphology, neuron size and number, and specific gene expression levels. In most 
cases, sex differences are induced by the sex steroid hormonal milieu during
early perinatal development. In rodents, the hypothalamic anteroventral
periventricular nucleus (AVPV) is sexually differentiated as a result of
postnatal sex steroids, and also specific neuronal populations in this nucleus
are sexually dimorphic, with females possessing more kisspeptin, dopaminergic,
and GABA/glutamate neurons than males. The ability of female rodents, but not
males, to display an estrogen-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is
consistent with the higher levels of these neuropeptides in the AVPV of females. 
Of these AVPV populations, the recently identified kisspeptin system has been
most strongly implicated as a crucial component of the sexually dimorphic LH
surge mechanism, though GABA and glutamate have also received some attention. New
findings have suggested that the sexual differentiation and development of
kisspeptin neurons in the AVPV is mediated by developmental estradiol signaling. 
Although apoptosis is the most common process implicated in neuronal sexual
differentiation, it is currently unknown how developmental estradiol acts to
differentiate specific neuronal populations in the AVPV, such as kisspeptin or
dopaminergic neurons.

In recent years spectacular advances in the field of epigenetics have taken
place. Multiple lines of evidence that connect epigenetic regulation to brain
functions have been accumulating. Neurons daily convert a variety of external
stimuli into rapid or long-lasting changes in gene expression. Control is
achieved through several covalent modifications that occur both on DNA and
chromatin. Specific modifications mediate many developmental processes and adult 
brain functions, such as synaptic plasticity and memory. In this review, we focus
on crucial chromatin remodeling events that mediate long-lasting neuronal
responses. The challenging goal is to reach sufficient understanding of these
epigenetic pathways in the brain so that they may be useful for future
development of specific pharmacological strategies.

The prevalence of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of cognitive functions 
and behaviour.

A complex interplay between the pattern of DNA methylation and a large and
growing number of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones contribute 
to the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. This epigenetic regulation
involves histone acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, and is now known
to be important for several forms and phases of long-term memory. Anomalies in
the epigenome have also been demonstrated to be critical factors in a number of
cognitive and behavioural disorders. The epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to
these deficits include: first, the dysregulation of key components of the
epigenetic machinery; second, alterations in the expression of genes important
for cognition and behaviour by epigenetic mechanisms; third, instability at
trinucleotide repeats; and fourth, the breakdown of major epigenetic processes
like imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Thus, both pharmacological and
environmental interventions that act on epigenetic mechanisms provide a promising
tool for the treatment of a wide variety of cognitive and behavioural disorders.

Stem cells niches during development--lessons from the cerebral cortex.

Adult stem cells are typically dependent on their specific niche environment,
here we discuss to which extent this is applicable in the embryonic cortex.
During development, signals regulating both proliferation and differentiation are
derived from local sources within the stem and progenitor cell zone of the
cerebral cortex as well as from extrinsic sources, such as the meninges, blood
vessels and the cerebrospinal fluid. However, neural stem cells isolated as
single cells in vitro self-renew and progress through a normal sequence of
lineage decisions in the absence of the above signals. Taking these data together
we propose a concept of intrinsic specification of the major lineage decisions
with environmental niche signals influencing quantitative aspects, such as
numbers of stem cells and timing of lineage progression, which are the parameters
affected during brain evolution.

MicroRNAs contribute significantly to the development, survival, function, and
plasticity of neurons. They silence expression of target genes by reducing mRNA
stability and translation. Production of microRNAs is controlled via
developmental and environmental cues and these small molecules, in concert with
classical transcriptional regulators, amplify changes in neuronal maturation,
dendrite morphogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Neurons compartmentalize mRNAs and
microRNAs within specific subcellular domains to facilitate control of local
protein synthesis in response to neuronal stimuli and to modulate synaptic
plasticity. This review addresses issues relevant to microRNA function in
neurons, in particular, their ability to reinforce developmental decisions and
promote synaptic plasticity.

Chromatin remodeling is a dynamic alteration of chromatin structure that
regulates several important biological processes. It is brought about by
enzymatic activities that catalyze covalent modifications of histone tail or
movement of nucleosomes along the DNA, and these activities often require
multisubunit protein complexes for its proper functions. In concert with DNA
methylation and noncoding RNA-mediated processes, histone modification such as
acetylation and methylation regulates gene expression epigenetically, without
affecting DNA sequence. Recent advances have revealed that this intrinsic
regulation, together with protein complexes such as RE1 silencer of
transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) and switch/sucrose
nonfermentable (SWI/SNF), play critical roles in neural stem cell fate
determination.

The plasticity of the nervous system is due to the ability of neurons to change
their properties by altering the function of their proteome. A major mechanism
for this is through altering the amount of proteins by regulating their
translation. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the elucidation of
the mechanisms by which neurons regulate translation during synaptic plasticity. 
Particular focus will be on the different transduction mechanisms that
selectively target distinct elements of the mRNA in the regulation of translation
during plasticity.

Neuronal intrinsic barriers for axon regeneration in the adult CNS.

Neurology, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

A major reason for the devastating and permanent disabilities after spinal cord
and other types of CNS injury is the failure of injured axons to regenerate and
to re-build the functional circuits. Thus, a long-standing goal has been to
develop strategies that could promote axon regeneration and restore functions.
Recent studies revealed that simply removing extracellular inhibitory activities 
is insufficient for successful axon regeneration in the adult CNS. On the other
side, evidence from different species and different models is accumulating to
support the notion that diminished intrinsic regenerative ability of mature
neurons is a major contributor to regeneration failure. This review will
summarize the molecular mechanisms regulating intrinsic axon growth capacity in
the adult CNS and discuss potential implications for therapeutic strategies.

Signaling mechanisms regulating synapse formation and function in mental
retardation.

Major progress has been carried out in the last two decades in the identification
of genetic alterations associated with mental retardation and autism spectrum
disorders. In many instances these defects concern genes coding for synaptic
proteins or proteins involved in regulation of synaptic properties. Analyses of
the underlying mechanisms using gain and loss of function approaches have
revealed alterations of spine morphology, density or plasticity, raising the
possibility that these disorders result from synaptopathies. Also the
multiplicity of genes and proteins involved points to the implication of specific
signaling pathways among which small GTPases appear to play a central role. We
review here this evidence and discuss the mechanisms through which they might
lead to synaptic network dysfunction.

Ambiguity and invariance: two fundamental challenges for visual processing.

USA. nrust@sas.upenn.edu

The visual system is tasked with extracting stimulus content (e.g. the identity
of an object) from the spatiotemporal light pattern falling on the retina.
However, visual information can be ambiguous with regard to content (e.g. an
object when viewed from far away), requiring the system to also consider
contextual information. Additionally, visual information originating from the
same content can differ (e.g. the same object viewed from different angles),
requiring the system to extract content invariant to these differences. In this
review, we explore these challenges from experimental and theoretical
perspectives, and motivate the need to incorporate solutions for both ambiguity
and invariance into hierarchical models of visual processing.

Correlations between the activity of sensory neurons and behavior: how much do

How the activity of sensory neurons elicits perceptions and guides behavior is
central to our understanding of the brain and is a subject of intense
investigation in neuroscience. Correlations between the activity of sensory
neurons and behavior have been widely observed and are sometimes used to infer
how neurons are used to guide a certain behavior. This view is challenged firstly
by theoretical considerations that these correlations rely on the existence of
correlated noise and its structure, and secondly by recent empirical observations
suggesting that such correlated noise is not a fixed network property but that it
depends on various sources, and varies with a subject's mental state.

Although we know enormous amounts of detailed information about the neurons that 
make up the cortex, placing this information back into the context of the
behaving animal is a serious challenge. The functional cell assembly hypothesis
first described by Hebb (The Organization of Behavior; a Neuropsychological
Theory. New York: Wiley; 1949) aimed to provide a mechanistic explanation of how 
groups of neurons, acting together, form a percept. The vast number of neurons
potentially involved make testing this hypothesis exceedingly difficult as
neither the number nor locations of assembly members are known. Although
increasing the number of neurons from which simultaneous recordings are made is
of benefit, providing evidence for or against a hypothesis like Hebb's requires
more than this. In this review, we aim to outline some recent technical advances,
which may light the way in the chase for the functional cell assembly.

Biology provides examples of efficient machines which greatly outperform
conventional technology. Designers in neuromorphic engineering aim to construct
electronic systems with the same efficient style of computation. This task
requires a melding of novel engineering principles with knowledge gleaned from
neuroscience. We discuss recent progress in realizing neuromorphic sensory
systems which mimic the biological retina and cochlea, and subsequent sensor
processing. The main trends are the increasing number of sensors and sensory
systems that communicate through asynchronous digital signals analogous to neural
spikes; the improved performance and usability of these sensors; and novel
sensory processing methods which capitalize on the timing of spikes from these
sensors. Experiments using these sensors can impact how we think the brain
processes sensory information.

Multisensory integration plays several important roles in the nervous system. One
is to combine information from multiple complementary cues to improve stimulus
detection and discrimination. Another is to resolve peripheral sensory
ambiguities and create novel internal representations that do not exist at the
level of individual sensors. Here we focus on how ambiguities inherent in
vestibular, proprioceptive and visual signals are resolved to create behaviorally
useful internal estimates of our self-motion. We review recent studies that have 
shed new light on the nature of these estimates and how multiple, but
individually ambiguous, sensory signals are processed and combined to compute
them. We emphasize the need to combine experiments with theoretical insights to
understand the transformations that are being performed.

'Auditory scenes' often contain contributions from multiple acoustic sources.
These are usually heard as separate auditory 'streams', which can be selectively 
followed over time. How and where these auditory streams are formed in the
auditory system is one of the most fascinating questions facing auditory
scientists today. Findings published within the past two years indicate that both
cortical and subcortical processes contribute to the formation of auditory
streams, and they raise important questions concerning the roles of primary and
secondary areas of auditory cortex in this phenomenon. In addition, these
findings underline the importance of taking into account the relative timing of
neural responses, and the influence of selective attention, in the search for
neural correlates of the perception of auditory streams.

of Rochester, NY 14627, United States.

Neural mechanisms underlying depth perception are reviewed with respect to three 
computational goals: determining surface depth order, gauging depth intervals,
and representing 3D surface geometry and object shape. Accumulating evidence
suggests that these three computational steps correspond to different stages of
cortical processing. Early visual areas appear to be involved in depth ordering, 
while depth intervals, expressed in terms of relative disparities, are likely
represented at intermediate stages. Finally, 3D surfaces appear to be processed
in higher cortical areas, including an area in which individual neurons encode 3D
surface geometry, and a population of these neurons may therefore represent 3D
object shape. How these processes are integrated to form a coherent 3D percept of
the world remains to be understood.

Normal sensory experience rarely presents us with isolated bars, gratings, or
other stimuli that have shaped our knowledge of sensory representations. Instead,
typical input adheres to certain statistical regularities, which make it
'natural' and cannot be adequately modeled by linear superposition of simple
stimuli. Natural stimuli necessitate a paradigm shift with a focus on downstream 
processing. This shift currently follows three main lines: quantification of the 
information a downstream area can read out (decoding); describing a
representation as the optimization of computational principles with respect to
natural input (normative approach); understanding the sensory representation as
optimal for the systems' tasks and intended actions (behavioral context). The
interaction between representational levels, intermediate-level features, and
bidirectional coupling through attention are key elements for sensory processing.

Texture sensation through the fingertips and the whiskers.

Texture sensation in primates, through the fingertips, and in rats, through the
whiskers, is rapid and accurate. Recent work has provided enough knowledge to
allow comparison of the mechanisms. In primates, coarse textures are sensed
through a spatial signal - increasing roughness leads to greater contrast in
firing among neurons with nearby receptive fields. Fine textures are sensed by a 
motion signal - when the fingertip translates across the surface, excitation of
rapidly adapting receptors varies according to texture. In rats, passage of a
whisker over a surface leads to a motion signal that varies according to
roughness. Motion is converted to neuronal spike trains, with progressively
rougher surfaces leading to progressively greater firing rates. The extraction of
texture by the whiskers shares basic features with the motion-based mechanism in 
primates. Spatial relationships among whiskers may serve purposes other than
texture.

Sparse and powerful cortical spikes.

Activity in cortical networks is heterogeneous, sparse and often precisely timed.
The functional significance of sparseness and precise spike timing is debated,
but our understanding of the developmental and synaptic mechanisms that shape
neuronal discharge patterns has improved. Evidence for highly specialized,
selective and abstract cortical response properties is accumulating. Singe-cell
stimulation experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of cortical networks to
the action potentials of some, but not all, single neurons. It is unclear how
this sensitivity of cortical networks to small perturbations comes about and
whether it is a generic property of cortex. The unforeseen sensitivity to
cortical spikes puts serious constraints on the nature of neural coding schemes.

Acoustic communication in flies is based on the production and perception of
courtship song. Drosophila males sing to females during the courtship ritual,
while females listen for the correct species-specific song parameters before
deciding to mate. While we know that song is important for mating, the neural
mechanisms involved in song recognition remain mysterious. However, the last few 
years have seen major advances in our understanding of the auditory system of
Drosophila, including delineation of the neurons involved in song production,
detailed characterization of the auditory receptor organ, and mapping of auditory
projections into the brain. The stage is being set to tackle the auditory system 
of Drosophila in much the same way as has been done for its olfactory system.
This review covers recent work and discusses prospects for future research on
Drosophila audition.

Investigation of how specialized olfactory cues, such as pheromones, are detected
has primarily focused on the function of receptor neurons within a subsystem of
the nasal cavity, the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Behavioral analyses have long
indicated that additional, non-VNO olfactory neurons are similarly necessary for 
pheromone detection; however, the identity of these neurons has been a mystery.
Recent molecular, behavioral, and genomic approaches have led to the
identification of multiple atypical sensory circuits that display characteristics
suggestive of a specialized function. This review focuses on these non-VNO
receptors and neurons, and evaluates their potential for mediating stereotyped
olfactory behavior in mammals.

Although sensory processing in V1 has been extensively characterized, the role of
GABAergic inhibition is still not well understood. Advances in molecular biology 
have now removed significant barriers to the direct investigation of inhibitory
processes in vivo. Recent studies have provided important insights into the
influence of GABAergic inhibition on cortical processing at both the single cell 
level, where inhibition helps to shape cortical receptive fields, and at the
network level, where inhibition is critical for generating cortical oscillations 
and setting network state.

Songbirds are well suited to studies of vocal processing not only because of
their impressive motor abilities, but also because of their exquisite sensory
system that allows them to detect subtle song variability, memorize complex
songs, and monitor auditory feedback during singing. Recent experiments point to 
areas outside the traditional song system for being relevant to sensory functions
implicated in song learning. By manipulating or suppressing activity in these
areas, adult birds lose their ability to recognize the songs of their tutors and 
juveniles are unable to form accurate copies of tutor song. Taken together, these
experiments show that the sensory mechanisms for vocal learning encompass a
larger network than previously thought.

The whisker somatosensory system in awake, behaving rodents is a powerful model
for studying neurobiology of sensation, from molecules to circuits to behavior.
Recent studies reveal how key tactile features are detected in awake animals and 
encoded by spike trains in somatosensory cortex (S1). Here we summarize progress 
on detection of surface texture (roughness). Texture appears to be inferred from 
the statistics of complex, irregular whisker micromotion on surfaces,
specifically by mean speed or by patterns of discrete, high-velocity whisker
slips. These are encoded in S1 by mean firing rate and by sparse, synchronous,
slip-evoked spike volleys, respectively. An alternative model of place coding for
texture based on differential whisker resonance is less well supported, but is
not ruled out.

Spatial and temporal activity patterns of olfactory bulb projection neurons
underlie the initial representations of odors in the brain. However, olfactory
perception ultimately requires the integration of olfactory bulb output in higher
cortical brain regions. Recent studies reveal that odor representations are
sparse and highly distributed in the rodent primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. 
Furthermore, odor-evoked inhibition is far more widespread and broadly tuned than
excitation in piriform cortex pyramidal cells. Other recent studies highlight how
olfactory sensory inputs are integrated within pyramidal cell dendrites and that 
feedback projections from piriform cortex to olfactory bulb interneurons are a
source of synaptic plasticity.

Engineered tracking systems 'fuse' data from disparate sensor platforms, such as 
radar and video, to synthesize information that is more reliable than any single 
input. The mammalian brain registers visual and auditory inputs to directionally 
localize an interesting environmental feature. For a fly, sensory perception is
challenged by the extreme performance demands of high speed flight. Yet even a
fruit fly can robustly track a fragmented odor plume through varying visual
environments, outperforming any human engineered robot. Flies integrate disparate
modalities, such as vision and olfaction, which are neither related by
spatiotemporal spectra nor processed by registered neural tissue maps. Thus, the 
fly is motivating new conceptual frameworks for how low-level multisensory
circuits and functional algorithms produce high-performance motor control.

Although we know enormous amounts of detailed information about the neurons that 
make up the cortex, placing this information back into the context of the
behaving animal is a serious challenge. The functional cell assembly hypothesis
first described by Hebb (The Organization of Behavior; a Neuropsychological
Theory. New York: Wiley; 1949) aimed to provide a mechanistic explanation of how 
groups of neurons, acting together, form a percept. The vast number of neurons
potentially involved make testing this hypothesis exceedingly difficult as
neither the number nor locations of assembly members are known. Although
increasing the number of neurons from which simultaneous recordings are made is
of benefit, providing evidence for or against a hypothesis like Hebb's requires
more than this. In this review, we aim to outline some recent technical advances,
which may light the way in the chase for the functional cell assembly.

Vive les differences! Individual variation in neural mechanisms of executive
control.

Investigations of individual differences have become increasingly important in
the cognitive neuroscience of executive control. For instance, individual
variation in lateral prefrontal cortex function (and that of associated regions) 
has recently been used to identify contributions of executive control processes
to a number of domains, including working memory capacity, anxiety,
reward/motivation, and emotion regulation. However, the origins of such
individual differences remain poorly understood. Recent progress toward
identifying the genetic and environmental sources of variation in neural traits, 
in combination with progress in identifying the causal relationships between
neural and cognitive processes, will be essential for developing a mechanistic
understanding of executive control.

The amount of information we can actively maintain 'in mind' is very limited.
This capacity limitation, known as working memory (WM) capacity, has been of
great interest because of its wide scope influence on the variety of intellectual
abilities. Recently, there has been an ongoing debate about how this capacity
should be best characterized. One viewpoint argues that WM capacity is allocated 
in a discrete fashion with an upper limit of three to four representations. An
alternative viewpoint argues that the capacity can be allocated in a continuous
fashion with no upper limit in the number of representations. In this article, we
will review recent neurobiological and behavioral evidence that has helped shape 
the debate regarding one of the more central mechanisms in cognitive
neuroscience.

Multielectrode recording experiments let us measure correlations between the
activity of individual neurons and the neural circuits in which they are
embedded. Recently, multielectrode studies have been emphasizing how correlated
neuronal activity is linked with behavior. Decisions are fundamental to voluntary
behavior. Here, we discuss computations necessary to turn a decision into an
action and review progress in studying correlated neural activity in areas of the
brain which link sensory and motor representations. The themes that emerge are
that correlated patterns of activity in populations of neurons can be revealed by
measurements of field potential fluctuations and that these measurements can
relate the activity of individual neurons to the activity of populations of
neurons distributed across different regions of the brain. Investigations into
patterns of neuronal correlation are helping us to understand how decisions and
other cognitive processes result from the interactions between different brain
systems that are responsible for controlling and regulating our behavior.

In this review, we consider the potential functional role of beta-band
oscillations, which at present is not yet well understood. We discuss evidence
from recent studies on top-down mechanisms involved in cognitive processing, on
the motor system and on the pathophysiology of movement disorders that suggest a 
unifying hypothesis: beta-band activity seems related to the maintenance of the
current sensorimotor or cognitive state. We hypothesize that beta oscillations
and/or coupling in the beta-band are expressed more strongly if the maintenance
of the status quo is intended or predicted, than if a change is expected.
Moreover, we suggest that pathological enhancement of beta-band activity is
likely to result in an abnormal persistence of the status quo and a deterioration
of flexible behavioural and cognitive control.

In goal-directed decision-making, animals choose between actions that are
associated with different reward outcomes (e.g., foods) and with different costs 
(e.g., effort). Rapid advances have been made over the past few years in our
understanding of the computations associated with goal-directed choices, and of
how those computations are implemented in the brain. We review some important
findings, with an emphasis on computational models, human fMRI, and monkey
neurophysiology studies.

Sensory processing is often regarded as a passive process in which biological
receptors like photoreceptors and mechanoreceptors transduce physical energy into
a neural code. Recent findings, however, suggest that: first, most sensory
processing is active, and largely determined by motor/attentional sampling
routines; second, owing to rhythmicity in the motor routine, as well as to its
entrainment of ambient rhythms in sensory regions, sensory inflow tends to be
rhythmic; third, attentional manipulation of rhythms in sensory pathways is
instrumental to perceptual selection. These observations outline the essentials
of an Active Sensing paradigm, and argue for increased emphasis on the study of
sensory processes as specific to the dynamic motor/attentional context in which
inputs are acquired.

Heterogeneous reward signals in prefrontal cortex.

Neurons encode upcoming rewards throughout frontal cortex. Recent papers have
helped to determine that these signals play different roles in different frontal 
regions. Neurons in orbitofrontal cortex (PFo) appear to be responsible for
calculating the specific value of an expected reward, information that can help
efficiently guide decision-making. Similar signals are also present in the
cingulate sulcus (PFcs). By contrast, reward signals in lateral prefrontal cortex
(PFl) are consistent with a role in using reward to guide other cognitive
processes, such as the allocation of attentional resources and using value
information to guide learning other relationships in the environment such as
arbitrary stimulus-response mappings. A remaining issue for future work is to
specify the precise roles of PFo and PFcs. These two areas show very different
patterns of connectivity with other brain areas, and it is currently unclear how 
this effects their contribution to decision-making.

CA 94305, USA.

Top-down visual attention improves perception of selected stimuli and that
improvement is reflected in the neural activity at many stages throughout the
visual system. Recent studies of top-down attention have elaborated on the
signatures of its effects within visual cortex and have begun identifying its
causal basis. Evidence from these studies suggests that the correlates of spatial
attention exhibited by neurons within the visual system originate from a
distributed network of structures involved in the programming of saccadic eye
movements. We summarize this evidence and discuss its relationship to the neural 
mechanisms of spatial working memory.

Synchronous neural activity and memory formation.

USA.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the synchronization of neuronal activity
plays an important role in memory formation. In particular, several recent
studies have demonstrated that enhanced synchronous activity within and among
medial temporal lobe structures is correlated with increased memory performance
in humans and animals. Modulations in rhythmic synchronization in the
gamma-frequency (30-100 Hz) and theta-frequency (4-8 Hz) bands have been related 
to memory performance, and interesting relationships have been described between 
these oscillations that suggest a mechanism for inter-areal coupling. Neuronal
synchronization has also been linked to spike timing-dependent plasticity, a
cellular mechanism thought to underlie learning and memory. The available
evidence suggests that neuronal synchronization modulates memory performance as
well as potential cellular mechanisms of memory storage.

Prefrontal control of fear: more than just extinction.

Juan, Puerto Rico. fsotresb@gmail.com

Although fear research has largely focused on the amygdala, recent findings
highlight cortical control of the amygdala in the service of fear regulation. In 
rodent models, it is becoming well established that the infralimbic (IL)
prefrontal cortex plays a key role in extinction learning, and recent findings
are uncovering molecular mechanisms involved in extinction-related plasticity.
Furthermore, mounting evidence implicates the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex in
the production of fear responses. Both IL and PL integrate inputs from the
amygdala, as well as other structures to gate the expression of fear via
projections to inhibitory or excitatory circuits within the amygdala. We suggest 
that dual control of the amygdala by separate prefrontal modules increases the
flexibility of an organism's response to danger cues.

Re-valuing the amygdala.

Morrison SE(1), Salzman CD.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Recent advances indicate that the amygdala represents valence: a general
appetitive/aversive affective characteristic that bears similarity to the
neuroeconomic concept of value. Neurophysiological studies show that individual
amygdala neurons respond differentially to a range of stimuli with positive or
negative affective significance. Meanwhile, increasingly specific
lesion/inactivation studies reveal that the amygdala is necessary for
processes--for example, fear extinction and reinforcer devaluation--that involve 
updating representations of value. Furthermore, recent neuroimaging studies
suggest that the human amygdala mediates performance on many reward-based
decision-making tasks. The encoding of affective significance by the amygdala
might be best described as a representation of state value-a representation that 
is useful for coordinating physiological, behavioral, and cognitive responses in 
an affective/emotional context.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms provide powerful explanations for simple
learning and decision-making behaviors and the functions of their underlying
neural substrates. Unfortunately, in real-world situations that involve many
stimuli and actions, these algorithms learn pitifully slowly, exposing their
inferiority in comparison to animal and human learning. Here we suggest that one 
reason for this discrepancy is that humans and animals take advantage of
structure that is inherent in real-world tasks to simplify the learning problem. 
We survey an emerging literature on 'structure learning'--using experience to
infer the structure of a task--and how this can be of service to RL, with an
emphasis on structure in perception and action.

The past 15 years have seen a rapid increase in our understanding of
orbitofrontal function. Today this region is the focus of an enormous amount of
research, including work on such complex phenomena as regret, ambiguity, and
willingness to pay. The orbitofrontal cortex is also credited as a major player
in a host of neuropsychiatric diseases. This transformation arguably began with
the application of concepts derived from animal learning theory. We will review
data from studies emphasizing these approaches to argue that the orbitofrontal
cortex forms a crucial part of a network of structures that signals information
about expected outcomes. Further we will suggest that, within this network, the
orbitofrontal cortex provides the critical ability to integrate information in
real-time to make what amounts to actionable predictions or estimates about
future outcomes. As we will show, the influence of these estimates can be
demonstrated experimentally in appropriate behavioral settings, and their
operation can also readily explain the role of orbitofrontal cortex in much more 
complex phenomena such as those cited above.

Cognitive control refers to the ability to perform task-relevant processing in
the face of other distractions or other forms of interference, in the absence of 
strong environmental support. It depends on the integrity of the prefrontal
cortex and associated biological structures (e.g., the basal ganglia).
Computational models have played an influential role in developing our
understanding of this system, and we review current developments in three major
areas: dynamic gating of prefrontal representations, hierarchies in the
prefrontal cortex, and reward, motivation, and goal-related processing in
prefrontal cortex. Models in these and other areas are advancing the field
further forward.

sequences of events, the assessment of novelty, the induction of plasticity
during encoding, as well as the consolidation and the retrieval of stored
memories. Recent findings indicate that theta and gamma related mechanisms
identified in rodent studies have significant parallels in the neurophysiology of
human and non-human primate memory. This correspondence between species opens new
perspectives for a mechanistic investigation of human memory function.

Recent research indicates that the orbital prefrontal cortex (PFo) represents
stimulus valuations and that the amygdala updates these valuations. An
exploration of how PFo and the amygdala interact could improve the understanding 
of both. PFo and the amygdala function cooperatively when monkeys choose objects 
associated with recently revalued foods. In other tasks, they function in
opposition. PFo uses positive feedback to promote learning in object-reward
reversal tasks, and PFo also promotes extinction learning. Amygdala function
interferes with both kinds of learning. The amygdala underlies fearful responses 
to a rubber snake from the first exposure on, but PFo is necessary only after the
initial exposure. The amygdala mediates an arousal response in anticipation of
rewards, whereas PFo sometimes suppresses such arousal. A role for PFo in
advanced cognition, for the amygdala in instinctive behavior, and for
cortex-subcortex interactions in prioritizing behaviors provides one account for 
these findings.

Learning in a constant environment, and adapting flexibly to a changing one,
through changes in reinforcement contingencies or valence-free cues, depends on
overlapping circuitry that interconnects the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with the
striatum and is subject to several forms of neurochemical modulation. We present 
evidence from recent studies in animals employing electrophysiological,
pharmacological and lesion techniques, and neuroimaging, neuropsychological and
pharmacological investigations of healthy humans and clinical patients. Dopamine 
(DA) neurotransmission in the medial striatum and PFC is critical for basic
reinforcement learning and the integration of negative feedback during reversal
learning, whilst orbitofrontal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) likely mediates this
type of low level flexibility, perhaps by reducing interference from salient
stimuli. The role of prefrontal noradrenaline (NA) in higher order flexibility
indexed through attentional set-shifting has recently received significant
empirical support, and similar avenues appear promising in the field of task
switching.

One form of cognitive control is the ability to resist temptation in favor of
long-term goal-oriented behavior. Historically, the development of cognitive
control capacity has been described by a linear function from infancy to
adulthood. However, the context in which control is required impacts behavioral
regulation abilities, such that emotionally charged or rewarding contexts can
diminish control. More recently, studies have begun to examine the development of
cognitive control in contexts that vary in motivation. These studies suggest
specific windows of development in which cognitive control capacity is more
vulnerable to incentive-based modulation. In this review we highlight the most
recent work on neurobiological changes supporting motivational and cognitive
development, underscoring the importance of functional organization and
development of the underlying circuitry implicated in these processes, and
provide a theoretical perspective that moves away from discussing singular
functional regions toward considering functional circuitry.

Neural networks in the hindbrain and spinal cord generate the simple patterns of 
motor activity that are necessary for breathing and locomotion. These networks
function autonomously, producing simple yet flexible rhythmic motor behaviours
that are highly responsive to sensory inputs and central control. This review
outlines recent advances in our understanding of the genetic programmes
controlling the assembly and functioning of circuits in the hindbrain and spinal 
cord that are responsible for respiration and locomotion. In addition, we
highlight the influence that target-derived retrograde signaling and
experience-dependent mechanisms have on establishing connectivity, particularly
with respect to sensory afferent innervation of the spinal cord.

Cortical development progresses through an early phase of progenitor expansion, a
middle phase of neurogenesis, and a final phase of gliogenesis. During the middle
phase, the neurogenic phase, the neocortical primordium balances the production
of neurons against the maintenance of neural precursor cells (NPCs). The final
number of neurons is determined by the duration of the neurogenic phase, the rate
of NPC division, and the mode of NPC division, that is, whether a division gives 
rise to two NPCs, one NPC and one cell committed to the neuronal lineage, or two 
committed cells. We discuss here recent advances in understanding these key
aspects that are fundamental for normal brain development.

The development of the central nervous system (CNS) is governed by networks of
extrinsic and intrinsic molecular programs that together orchestrate precise gene
regulation. For the past few years, significant progress has been made in the
characterization of histone-modifying enzymes and the roles they play in
transcriptional control by affecting chromatin structure. Importantly, recent
studies have revealed dynamic changes in histone modifications over the course of
neural cell-fate specification. Further understanding of physiological functions 
of histone-modifying enzymes and their molecular mechanisms of action in CNS
development will provide crucial insights into the process of generating neural
cell types with tremendous diversity. Here we discuss the recent advancement in
understanding the roles of enzymes involved in histone acetylation and
methylation during neural cell-type specification.

The primary cilium, a hair-like extension from a cell's surface, acts as a
sensory organelle to receive signals that regulate cellular behavior and
physiology. Like most mammalian cells, neural progenitors and neurons have
primary cilia. Recent studies show that this tiny projection plays important
roles in brain development and diseases. Ciliary mutant mice show defects in
brain patterning, progenitor proliferation, and specification of adult neural
stem cells. Primary cilia also have dual opposing functions in the development of
brain tumors. Ciliary defects are associated with genetic syndromes that
frequently have neurological symptoms. Understanding the multifaceted roles that 
primary cilia have in brain development will provide important insights into the 
mechanism of brain development and diseases.

While embryonic stem (ES) cells have been used for several years to generate
specific populations of neural cells in a translational perspective, they have
also emerged as a promising approach in developmental neurobiology, by providing 
reductionist models of neural development. Here we review recent work that
indicates that ES-based models are not only able to mimic normal brain
development, but also provide novel tools to dissect the relative contribution of
intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of neural specification. These have thus not
only revealed insights on early steps such as neural induction and regional
patterning, but also temporal specification of distinct neuronal subtypes, as
well as the later acquisition of more complex features such as cytoarchitecture
and hodological properties.

As a unique form of structural plasticity in the central nervous system, adult
neurogenesis in the hippocampus alters network functions by continuously adding
new neurons to the mature network, while at the same time is subjected to
regulation by surrounding network activity. Here, we review the recently
identified mechanisms through which network activity exerts its impacts on
multiple steps of adult neurogenesis in rodents and culminates in the selective
recruitment of new neurons. We also review recent progress on the study of
cellular connectivity modified by new neurons in the dentate gyrus and its
physiological functions in rodents. We believe that understanding these processes
will allow eventual elucidation of the mechanisms controlling the development of 
balanced inputs and outputs for the adult-born neurons and reveal important
insights into the cellular organization of learning and memory.

Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada.

Axon guidance, outgrowth, and synapse formation are interrelated developmental
events during the maturation of the nervous system. Establishing proper synaptic 
connectivity requires precise axon navigation and a coordinated switch between
axon outgrowth and synaptogenesis. The PHR (human Pam, mouse Phr1, zebrafish
Esrom, DrosophilaHighwire, and C. elegansRPM-1) protein family regulates both
axon and synapse development through their biochemical and functional
interactions with multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies have begun to
elucidate a common underlying mechanism for PHR functions: Consisting of motifs
that affect intracellular signaling, selective protein degradation, and
cytoskeleton organization, PHR proteins probably mediate the transition between
axon outgrowth and synaptogenesis through integrating intracellular signaling and
microtubule remodeling.

Neural stem and progenitor cells generate the central nervous system (CNS) in
organisms as diverse as insects and mammals. In Drosophila, multipotent
asymmetrically dividing progenitors called neuroblasts produce neurons and glia
throughout the developing CNS. Nevertheless, the time-windows of mitotic
activity, the division modes, the termination mechanisms and the lineage sizes of
individual neuroblasts all vary considerably from region-to-region. Recent
studies shed light on some of the mechanisms underlying this neuroblast diversity
and, in particular, how proliferation is boosted in two brain regions. In the
central brain, some specialised neuroblasts generate intermediate neural
progenitors that can each divide multiple times, thus increasing overall lineage 
size. In the optic lobe, an alternative expansion strategy involves symmetrically
dividing neuroepithelial cells generating large numbers of asymmetrically
dividing neuroblasts. Evidence is also emerging for a cell-intrinsic timer that
alters the properties of each neuroblast with increasing developmental age. The
core mechanism corresponds to a series of transcription factors that coordinates 
temporal changes in neuronal/glial identity with transitions in neuroblast
cell-cycle speed, entry into quiescence and, ultimately, with termination.

In bilaterally symmetric organisms, the midline is a critical organizing center
for the developing central nervous system. There is a striking conservation of
the molecules and mechanisms that control axon path finding at the midline in
vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. The majority of axons in the CNS
cross the midline before projecting to their contralateral synaptic targets and
this crossing decision is under exquisite spatial and temporal regulation.
Growing commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals, while
inhibiting responses to repulsive signals. Once across, repulsion dominates,
allowing axons to leave and preventing them from re-entering the midline. Here we
review recent advances in flies and mice that illuminate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the establishment of precise connectivity at the midline.

The proper development and patterning of axons, dendrites, and synapses is
essential for the establishment of accurate neuronal circuits in the brain. A
major goal in neurobiology is to identify the mechanisms and principles that
govern these fundamental developmental events of neuronal circuit formation. In
recent years, exciting new studies have suggested that ubiquitin signaling
pathways may play crucial roles in the control of neuronal connectivity. Among E3
ubiquitin ligases, Cdh1-anaphase promoting complex (Cdh1-APC) and Cdc20-APC have 
emerged as key regulators of diverse aspects of neuronal connectivity, from axon 
and dendrite morphogenesis to synapse differentiation and remodeling.

Neuronal migration is a fundamental process that determines the final allocation 
of neurons in the nervous system, establishing the basis for the subsequent
wiring of neural circuitry. From cell polarization to target identification,
neuronal migration integrates multiple cellular and molecular events that enable 
neuronal precursors to move across the brain to reach their final destination. In
this review we summarize novel findings on the key processes that govern the cell
biology of migrating neurons, describing recent advances in their molecular
regulation in different migratory pathways of the brain, spinal cord, and
peripheral nervous system. We will also review how this basic knowledge is
contributing to a better understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of
multiple neurological syndromes in which neuronal migration is disrupted.

Neural cell fate programs must generate an enormous number of neurons with
distinct adult functions. The decision to choose one neuronal subtype from two
alternatives--a binary fate decision--is one way to diversify neuronal subtypes
during nervous system development. Recent progress has been made in describing
the genetic programs that define late-stage neuronal identity. Here, we review
mechanisms that control how such fate decisions generate two different
postmitotic, terminally differentiated neuronal subtypes. We survey examples from
Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila that demonstrate different modes of binary 
neuronal fate specification that depend on cell division, lineage, stochastic
gene expression, or extracellular signals. Comparison of these strategies reveals
that, although organisms use diverse approaches to generate neural diversity,
some common themes do exist.

The rodent olfactory bulb (OB) is becoming a model system for studying how
neuronal circuits develop and maintain. The OB has typical components of a
sensory circuit such as ordered sensory inputs, diverse populations of
interneurons, substantial neuromodulatory innervation, and projection neurons
that transfer information to higher brain centers. Additionally, the OB is unique
because its sensory afferents and a subset of its interneurons are continuously
replaced throughout adulthood. Here, we review some recent findings on the
development and maintenance of the mammalian OB circuitry. We review some of the 
known developmental strategies of the major OB components and discuss the ways in
which the OB circuitry preserves stability in the face of ongoing changes.

Birth time/order-dependent neuron type specification.

Neurons derived from the same progenitor may acquire different fates according to
their birth timing/order. To reveal temporally guided cell fates, we must
determine neuron types as well as their lineage relationships and times of birth.
Recent advances in genetic lineage analysis and fate mapping are facilitating
such studies. For example, high-resolution lineage analysis can identify each
sequentially derived neuron of a lineage and has revealed abrupt temporal
identity changes in diverse Drosophila neuronal lineages. In addition, fate
mapping of mouse neurons made from the same pool of precursors shows production
of specific neuron types in specific temporal patterns. The tools used in these
analyses are helping to further our understanding of the genetics of neuronal
temporal identity.

Twigs into branches: how a filopodium becomes a dendrite.

A dendrite grows by sprouting filopodia, some of which mature into stable
dendrite branches that bear synapses and sprout filopodia of their own. Recent
work has shown that a filopodium begins deciding to become a stable branch within
1min of contacting a presynaptic partner, but what triggers this decision remains
unknown. We consider the evidence for three possible triggers: activity of
neurotransmitter receptors, signaling through adhesion proteins, and heightened
membrane tension as the filopodium attempts to retract but is held in place by
adhesive contacts with the target. Of these, membrane tension-induced signaling
is especially appealing, as it would serve as a general reporter of attachment,
independent of which specific adhesion molecules are used.

Formation of the human brain during embryonic and postnatal development is an
extraordinarily complex process resulting at maturity in billions of neurons with
trillions of specialized connections called synapses. These synapses, composed of
a varicosity or bouton from a presynaptic neuron that communicates with a
dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron, comprise the neural network that is
essential for complex behavioral phenomena and cognition. Inappropriate synapse
formation or structure is thought to underlie several developmental
neuropathologies. Even in the mature CNS, alterations in synapse structure and
function continues to be a very dynamic process that is foundational to learning 
and memory as well as other adaptive abilities of the brain. This synaptic
plasticity in mature neurons, which is often triggered by certain patterns of
neural activity, is again multifaceted and involves post-translational
modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) and subcellular relocalization or
trafficking (endocytosis/exocytosis) of existing synaptic proteins, initiation of
protein synthesis from existing mRNAs localized in dendrites or spines, and
triggering of new gene transcription in the nucleus. These various cellular
processes support varying temporal components of synaptic plasticity that begin
within 1-2 min but can persist for hours to days. This review will give a
critical assessment of activity-dependent molecular modulations of synapses
reported over the past couple years. Owing to space limitations, it will focus on
mammalian excitatory (i.e. glutamatergic) synapses and will not consider several 
activity-independent signaling pathways (e.g. ephrinB receptor) that also
modulate spine and synapse formation.

The brain requires diverse neuronal subtypes to carry out its complex functions. 
Many types of neurons are produced through asymmetric division, and the molecular
mechanisms of asymmetric division have been extensively studied in C. elegans and
Drosophila. In these model organisms, the same molecular mechanisms regulate
asymmetric divisions throughout development, although diverse cell types are
created. How these common mechanisms for asymmetric division can specify diverse 
neuronal fates, however, is still being discovered. Recent studies suggest that
neurons are specified by the combined effects of asymmetric divisions, which are 
regulated by common mechanisms, and specific transcription factors expressed in
the mother cell.

Saccade control after V1 lesion revisited.

Sciences, Myodaiji, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan. tisa@nips.ac.jp

A number of previous articles on blindsight have stressed that even after the
lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1), subjects can perform visually guided
saccades toward the targets in the blind field and that the extrageniculate
visual pathway which bypasses the V1 can control the saccades by itself. However,
in monkey model of V1 lesion, about two months of time is needed for recovery,
suggesting that the extrageniculate visual pathway cannot immediately take over
the function of the geniculo-striatal pathway, and on close look at the dynamics 
of saccades, saccades became ballistic and online corrections of trajectories and
velocities were impaired, and that decision threshold for saccade initiation was 
lowered. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the visual signal
through V1 is necessary for deliberate control of saccades.

We review visually guided behaviors in larval zebrafish and summarise what is
known about the neural processing that results in these behaviors, paying
particular attention to the progress made in the last 2 years. Using the examples
of the optokinetic reflex, the optomotor response, prey tracking and the visual
startle response, we illustrate how the larval zebrafish presents us with a very 
promising model vertebrate system that allows neurocientists to integrate
functional and behavioral studies and from which we can expect illuminating
insights in the near future.

Spinal interneurons are organized into networks that control the activity and
output of the motor system. This review outlines recent progress in defining the 
rules that govern the assembly and function of spinal motor networks, focusing on
three main areas. We first examine how subtle variations in the wiring diagrams
and organization of locomotor networks in different vertebrates permits animals
to adapt their motor programs to the demands of their physical environment. We
discuss how the membrane properties of spinal interneurons, and their synaptic
interactions, underlie the modulation of motor circuits and encoded motor
behaviors. We also describe recent molecular genetic approaches to map and
manipulate the connectivity and interactions of spinal interneurons and to assess
the impact of such perturbations on network function and motor behavior.

The basal ganglia are known to control behavior using reward information;
however, recent experiments have revealed that the basal ganglia contribute to
the processing of salient non-rewarding events as well. Here, we suggest that the
temporal dynamics of the response of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) enable the basal
ganglia to have a dual role. The fast DAN response to salient events is mediated 
thorough the brainstem-basal ganglia loop. Forebrain loops enable the second
phase of the dopaminergic responses that require highly processed information.
The convergent encoding of fast/salient and slow/detailed information suggests
that the basal ganglia control the tradeoff between fast and immediate responses 
to environmental events and slow responses that are only executed after
substantial environmental information has been gathered.

selection.

Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.

The striatum is thought to play a central role in learning how to choose acts
that lead to reward and avoid punishment. Dopamine-dependent modification of
striatal synapses in the action selection circuitry has long been thought to be a
key step toward this type of learning. The development of new genetic and optical
tools has pushed this field forward in the last couple of years, demanding a
re-evaluation of models of how experience controls dopamine-dependent synaptic
plasticity and how disease states like Parkinson's disease affect the striatal
circuitry.

This review presents recent advances in the development of strategies to restore 
posture and locomotion after spinal cord injury (SCI). A set of strategies
focusing on the lesion site includes prevention of secondary damages, promotion
of axonal sprouting/regeneration, and replacement of lost cells. Other strategies
focus on spinal central pattern generators (CPGs). Training promotes functional
recovery by enhancing the plasticity of CPGs and these sublesional networks can
be reactivated by means of pharmacological or electrical stimulation. It is now
clear that substantial functional recovery will require a combination of
strategies adapted to each phase following SCI. Finally, improvements in the
understanding of the mechanisms underlying spasticity may lead to new treatments 
of this disabling complication affecting patients with SCI.

Neural interfaces (NIs) for motor control have recently become increasingly
advanced. This has been possible owing to substantial progress in our
understanding of the cortical motor system as well as the development of
appropriate decoding methods in both non-human primates and paralyzed patients.
So far, neural interfaces have controlled mainly computer screens and robotic
arms. An important advancement has been the demonstration of neural interfaces
that can directly control the subject's muscles. Furthermore, it has been shown
that cortical plasticity alone can optimize neural interface performance in the
absence of machine learning, which emphasizes the role of the brain for neural
interface adaptation. Future motor prostheses may use also sensory feedback to
enhance their control capabilities.

Recent research on the neurobiology of imitation has gone beyond the study of its
'core' mechanisms, focus of investigation of the past years.. The current trends 
can be grouped into four main categories: (1) non 'core' neural mechanisms that
are also important for imitation; (2) mechanisms of control, in both imitative
learning and inhibition of imitation; (3) the developmental trajectory of neural 
mechanisms of imitation and their relation with the development of social
cognition; (4) neurobiological mechanisms of imitation in non-primates, in
particular vocal learning in songbirds, and their relations with similar
mechanisms of vocal learning in humans. The existing data suggest that both
perceptual and motor aspects of imitation follow organizing principles that
originally belonged to the motor system.

Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field, crossing boundaries between
Economics, Psychology, and Neuroscience. Its original program was to provide a
test for a large number of competitive theories of decision making. It has in
part realized this program, and we review the main findings here. But its results
are also posing the need for a new theoretical unifying framework. We outline a
possible line of future research.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model organism for a
systems-level understanding of neural circuits and behavior. Advances in the
quantitative analyses of behavior and neuronal activity, and the development of
new technologies to precisely control and monitor the workings of interconnected 
circuits, now allow investigations into the molecular, cellular, and
systems-level strategies that transform sensory inputs into precise behavioral
outcomes.

Birdsong is a culturally transmitted behavior that depends on a juvenile
songbird's ability to imitate the song of an adult tutor. Neurobiological studies
of birdsong can reveal how a complex form of imitative learning, which bears
strong parallels to human speech learning, can be understood at the level of
underlying circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms. This review focuses on
recent studies that illuminate the neurobiological mechanisms for singing and
song learning.

Human morality provides the foundation for many of the pillars of society,
informing political legislation and guiding legal decisions while also governing 
everyday social interactions. In the past decade, researchers in the field of
cognitive neuroscience have made tremendous progress in the effort to understand 
the neural basis of human morality. The emerging insights from this research
point toward a model in which automatic processing in parallel neural circuits,
many of which are associated with social emotions, evaluate the actions and
intentions of others. Through various mechanisms of competition, only a subset of
these circuits ultimately causes a decision or an action. This activity is
experienced consciously as a subjective moral sense of right or wrong, and an
interpretive process offers post hoc explanations designed to link the social
stimulus with the subjective moral response using whatever explicit information
is available.

We often empathically share the states of others. The discovery of 'mirror
neurons' suggested a neural mechanism for monkeys to share the actions of others.
Here we expand this view by showing that mirror neurons for actions not only
exist in the premotor cortex or in monkeys and that vicarious activity can also
be measured for the emotions and sensations of others. Although we still need to 
empirically explore the function and development of these vicarious activations, 
we should stop thinking of vicarious brain activity as a peculiar property of the
premotor cortex: instead it seems to be a very common phenomenon which leads
social stimuli to recruit a wide range of seemingly private neural systems.

Neuroaesthetics is a relatively young field within cognitive neuroscience,
concerned with the neural underpinnings of aesthetic experience of beauty,
particularly in visual art. Neuroscientific investigations have approached this
area using imaging and neurophysiological techniques, such as functional magnetic
resonance (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). 
The results produced so far are very heterogeneous. Nonetheless, an overall view 
of the findings suggests that the aesthetic experience of visual artworks is
characterized by the activation of: sensorimotor areas; core emotional centres;
and reward-related centres. In the present review, we discuss the functional
relevance of these activations and propose that aesthetic experience is a
multilevel process exceeding a purely visual analysis of artworks and relying
upon visceromotor and somatomotor resonance in the beholder.

A long standing goal in motor control is to determine the fundamental output
controlled by the CNS: does the CNS control the activation of individual motor
units, individual muscles, groups of muscles, kinematic or dynamic features of
movement, or does it simply care about accomplishing a task? Of course, the
output controlled by the CNS might not be exclusive but instead multiple outputs 
might be controlled in parallel or hierarchically. In this review we examine one 
particular hypothesized level of control: that the CNS produces movement through 
the flexible combination of groups of muscles, or muscle synergies. Several
recent studies have examined this hypothesis, providing evidence both in support 
and in opposition to it. We discuss these results and the current state of the
muscle synergy hypothesis.

Efforts to characterize and classify the cellular components of the nervous
system have a rich history in modern neuroscience, and closely mirror the
development of new techniques to assay cellular properties. Recent advances in
high-throughput histology, genetics and neuroinformatics hold great promise for
systematic and reproducible measurement and community databasing of cellular
properties. In particular, transgenic approaches to reproducibly target and
manipulate specific cell types in mice are rapidly advancing. Cre
recombinase-based approaches in particular allow the coupling of cell type
specificity with a wide variety of genetic tools for visualization, molecular
profiling, tract tracing and functional manipulation. The reproducible multimodal
characterization allowed by these transgenics provides a means to classify,
building cellular taxonomies based on measurement of many phenotypic properties, 
as well as manipulate, moving beyond classification to understand the functional 
role of specific cell types and circuits in complex behaviors.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a widely adopted model organism for
studying various neurobiological processes at the molecular and cellular level in
vivo. With a small, flexible, and continuously moving body, the manipulation of
C. elegans becomes a challenging task. In this review, we highlight recent
advances in microfluidic technologies for the manipulation of C. elegans. These
new family of microfluidic chips are capable of handling single or populations of
worms in a high-throughput fashion and accurately controlling their
microenvironment. So far, they have been successfully used to study neural
circuits and behavior, to perform large-scale phetotyping and morphology-based
screens as well as to understand axon regeneration after injury. We envision that
microfluidic chips can further be used to study different aspects of the C.
elegans nervous system, extending from fundamental understanding of behavioral
dynamics to more complicated biological processes such as neural aging and
learning and memory.

High-content screening (HCS), historically limited to drug-development companies,
is now a powerful and affordable technology for academic researchers. Through
automated routines, this technology acquires large datasets of fluorescence
images depicting the functional states of thousands to millions of cells.
Information on shapes, textures, intensities, and localizations is then used to
create unique representations, or 'phenotypic signatures,' of each cell. These
signatures quantify physiologic or diseased states, for example, dendritic
arborization, drug response, or cell coping strategies. Live-cell imaging in HCS 
adds the ability to correlate cellular events at different points in time,
thereby allowing sensitivities and observations not possible with fixed endpoint 
analysis. HCS with live-cell imaging therefore provides an unprecedented
capability to detect spatiotemporal changes in cells and is particularly suited
for time-dependent, stochastic processes such as neurodegenerative disorders.

Historically, our understanding of synapse formation has been shaped by studies
focusing on neurons. However, with advancements in live imaging techniques and
molecular and genetic tools we are rapidly uncovering new roles for glia in
synapse formation and function. Contact-mediated signals from glia instruct
dendrites to become receptive to synaptic partners. Glia-secreted factors
coordinate the assembly and apposition of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic
specializations. Glial cells also provide cues that are required for synaptic
maturation and remodeling of spines both during development and in the adult. As 
we continue to learn about glial contributions to synapse formation and
maintenance, it is likely that glia-derived signals will emerge as potential
therapeutic targets for diseases that involve aberrant circuit function such as
autism, epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease.

Neural computations are implemented in densely interconnected networks of
excitable neurons as temporal sequences of coactive neuronal ensembles. Ensemble 
activity is produced by the interaction of external stimuli with internal states 
but has been difficult to directly study in the past. Currently, high-resolution 
optical imaging techniques are emerging as powerful tools to investigate neuronal
ensembles in living animals and to characterize their spatiotemporal properties. 
Here we review recent advances of two-photon calcium imaging and highlight
ongoing technical improvements as well as emerging applications. Significant
progress has been made in the extent and speed of imaging and in the adaptation
of imaging techniques to awake animals. These advances facilitate studies of the 
functional organization of local neural networks, their experience-dependent
reconfiguration, and their functional impairment in diseases. Optical probing of 
neuronal ensemble dynamics in vivo thus promises to reveal fundamental principles
of neural circuit function and dysfunction.

The crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in brain development is demonstrated by
the dramatic apoptotic phenotypes of mouse mutants abolishing all miRNAs
synthesis. Recent advances in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish and
mouse moved beyond this global understanding by targeting selected miRNAs. They
indicate that single miRNAs successively modulate all steps of brain maturation, 
including patterning, neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and subtype
specification, and neuronal activity. In detail, they reveal an amazing
functional complexity: specific miRNAs can either be used reiteratively, such as 
miR-9 in patterning, neurogenesis and differentiation, or concomitantly target
different mRNAs in distinct cellular compartments, such as Pumilio or Limk1 that 
can be inhibited by miR-134 to control neuritogenesis or spine growth,
respectively. Their regulation can be composite, either through multiple loci
(miR-9) or in blocks of numerous miRNAs (miR-134). A major step remains to
decipher their impact on brain function, in particular in the control of
behaviour.

Functions of axon guidance molecules in synapse formation.

Chen SY(1), Cheng HJ.

Author information:

United States.

Axon guidance and synapse formation are important developmental events for
establishing a functional neuronal circuitry. These two related cellular
processes occur in a coordinated fashion but previous studies from multiple model
organisms seemed to suggest that axon guidance and synapse formation are mediated
by distinct molecular cues. Thus, axon guidance molecules are responsible for
guiding the navigating axon toward its target area, while other adhesion or
ligand-receptor molecules specify the synapse formation within the target area.
However, accumulative evidence has shown that axon guidance molecules can
regulate the localization and formation of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic
components during synapse formation. These results demonstrate a role for axon
guidance molecules in synapse formation and provide insight into how axon
guidance and synapse formation are coordinated at the molecular level.

Neurobiology has entered a new era in which optical methods are challenging
electrophysiological techniques for their value in measuring and manipulating
neuronal activity. This change is occurring largely because of the development of
new photochemical tools, some synthesized by chemists and some provided by
nature. This review is focused on the three types of photochemical tools for
neuronal control that have emerged in recent years. Caged neurotransmitters,
including caged glutamate, are synthetic molecules that enable highly localized
activation of neurotransmitter receptors in response to light. Natural
photosensitive proteins, including channelrhodopsin-2 and halorhodopsin, can be
exogenously expressed in neurons and enable rapid photocontrol of action
potential firing. Synthetic small molecule photoswitches can bestow
light-sensitivity on native or exogenously expressed proteins, including K(+)
channels and glutamate receptors, allowing photocontrol of action potential
firing and synaptic events. At a rapid pace, these tools are being improved and
new tools are being introduced, thanks to molecular biology and synthetic
chemistry. The three families of photochemical tools have different capabilities 
and uses, but they all share in enabling precise and noninvasive exploration of
neural function with light.

Methods to label neurons and to monitor their activity with genetically encoded
fluorescent reporters have been a staple of neuroscience research for several
years. The recent introduction of photoswitchable ion channels and pumps, such as
channelrhodopsin (ChR2), halorhodopsin (NpHR), and light-gated glutamate receptor
(LiGluR), is enabling remote optical manipulation of neuronal activity. The
translucent brains of zebrafish offer superior experimental conditions for
optogenetic approaches in vivo. Enhancer and gene trapping approaches have
generated hundreds of Gal4 driver lines in which the expression of UAS-linked
effectors can be targeted to subpopulations of neurons. Local photoactivation of 
genetically targeted LiGluR, ChR2, or NpHR has uncovered novel functions for
specific areas and cell types in zebrafish behavior. Because the manipulation is 
restricted to times and places where genetics (cell types) and optics (beams of
light) intersect, this method affords excellent resolving power for the
functional analysis of neural circuitry.

Axons are the physical conduits by which information is relayed within the
nervous system and as such, are essential for normal neurological function. In
the central nervous system (CNS), axons comprise the bulk of the white matter,
where they are closely associated with glial cells. Primary alterations of glial 
cell functions can have detrimental secondary consequences for axons,
demonstrating that white matter glia are important custodians of axonal
integrity. For example, genetic ablation of key oligodendroglial molecules
abrogates the oligodendrocytes' supportive function, while expression of mutant
super oxide dismutase in astrocytes expedites progression of motor neuron
disease. Here we review some of the recent literature on the role of CNS glia in 
axonal health.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) comprises kinase signaling and transcription 
factor activation cascades delineated over the past 20 years. Most studies
conclude that this stress response is adaptive but, nevertheless, includes
maladaptive programs involving CHOP expression that drives cell-autonomous
apoptosis. Herein, we highlight several studies of UPR diseases involving
myelinating glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems that do not
support a primary role for CHOP in apoptosis. In oligodendrocytes, CHOP
expression apparently protects against death whereas in Schwann cells, CHOP
promotes demyelination in the absence of cell death. Together, these studies
demonstrate that CHOP should be viewed more broadly as a cell-specific and
context-specific mediator of adaptive or maladaptive responses to stress rather
than a proapoptotic transcription factor.

Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system
(CNS). They differentiate from proliferative OL precursor cells that migrate from
the embryonic neuroepithelium throughout the developing CNS before associating
with axons and elaborating myelin. Recent research into the regulation of OL
differentiation has uncovered a two-stage mechanism of transcriptional control
that combines epigenetic repression of transcriptional inhibitors with direct
transcriptional activation of myelin genes. This 'two-pronged' approach creates a
fail-safe system of genetic control to ensure orderly and unambiguous expression 
of the myelination program during development and during repair of demyelinated
lesions.

In the vertebrate nervous system, the myelin sheath allows for rapid and
efficient conduction of action potentials along axons. Despite the essential
function of myelin, many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms that
govern the development of myelinated axons. The fundamental properties of myelin 
are widely shared among vertebrates, and the zebrafish has emerged as a powerful 
system to study myelination in vivo. This review will highlight recent advances
from genetic screens in zebrafish, including the discovery of the role of kif1b
in mRNA localization in myelinating oligodendrocytes.

Most of our current knowledge about the neural control of behavior is based on
electrophysiology. Here we review advances and limitations of current
electrophysiological recording techniques applied in behaving animals.
Extracellular recording methods have improved with respect to sampling density
and miniaturization, and our understanding of the nature of the recorded signals 
has advanced. Juxtacellular recordings have become increasingly popular as they
allow identification of the recorded neurons. Juxtacellular recordings are
relatively easy to apply in behaving animals and can be used to stimulate
individual neurons. Methods for intracellular recordings in awake behaving
animals also advanced, and it has become clear that long-duration intracellular
recordings are possible even in freely moving animals. We conclude that the
electrophysiological methods repertoire has greatly diversified in recent years
and that the field has moved beyond what used to be a mere spike counting
business.

The cochlea possesses specialized features to receive sound signals and to
resolve and convert the frequency and intensity components within each signal for
auditory perception. It consists of precisely patterned and polarized sensory
cells adorned with a highly specialized mechanotransduction apparatus for
sensitivity and adaptation, and discrete nonsensory cellular networks for
biochemical and mechanical support to drive an integrated cellular response and
mechanotransduction. This review summarizes recent discoveries about the roles of
FGF, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling and transcriptional factors in the
differentiation and patterning of the auditory sensory organ, the Usher complex, 
and the planar cell polarity pathway in the formation and polarization of
mechanotransduction component hair bundles, and the contribution of nonsensory
cell networks in the stria vascularis and the sensory region toward the
maturation of the mammalian cochlea.

In the mammalian somatosensory system, mechanosensitive neurons mediate the
senses of touch and pain. Among sensory modalities, mechanosensation has been the
most elusive with regard to the identification of transduction molecules. One
factor that has hindered the identification of transduction molecules is the
diversity of neurons; physiological studies have revealed many subtypes of
neurons, specialized to detect a variety of mechanical stimuli. Do different
subtypes use the same transduction molecules that are modified by cellular
context? Or, are there multiple mechanotransducers that specialize in sensing
different mechanical stimuli? This review highlights recent progress in
identifying and characterizing candidate molecular force transducers, as well as 
the development of new tools to characterize touch transduction at the molecular,
cellular, and behavioral levels.

The act of eating and drinking brings food-related chemicals into contact with
taste cells. Activation of these taste cells, in turn, engages neural circuits in
the central nervous system that help animals identify foods and fluids, determine
what and how much to eat, and prepare the body for digestion and assimilation.
Analytically speaking, these neural processes can be divided into at least three 
categories: stimulus identification, ingestive motivation, and digestive
preparation. This review will discuss recent advances in peripheral gustatory
mechanisms, primarily from rodent models, in the context of these three major
categories of taste function.

A central tenet of neuroscience is that the precise patterns of connectivity
among neurons in a given brain area underlie its function. However, assigning any
aspect of perception or behavior to the wiring of local circuits has been
challenging. Here, we review recent work in sensory neocortex that demonstrates
the power of identifying specific cell types when investigating the functional
organization of brain circuits. These studies indicate that knowing the identity 
of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell type is key when analyzing
neocortical circuits. Furthermore, identifying the circuit organization of
particular cell types in the neocortex allows the recording and manipulation of
each cell type's activity and the direct testing of its functional role in
perception and behavior.

USA.

How does auditory cortex represent auditory stimuli, and how do these
representations contribute to behavior? Recent experimental evidence suggests
that activity in auditory cortex consists of sparse and highly synchronized
volleys of activity, observed both in anesthetized and awake animals. Many
neurons are capable of remarkably precise activity with very low jitter or spike 
count variability. Most importantly, animals are capable of exploiting such
precise neuronal activity in making sensory decisions. Whether the ability of
auditory cortex to exploit fine temporal differences in cortical activity is
unique to auditory modality, or represents a general strategy used by cortical
circuits remains an open question.

Sensory system function has evolved to meet the biological needs of organisms,
but it is less often regarded that sensory system form has by necessity evolved
to contend with the stimulus. For an olfactory system extracting meaningful
information from natural scents, the ecological milieu presents unique problems. 
Recent studies provide new insights into the perceptual and neural mechanisms
underlying how odorant elements are assembled into odor wholes, how odor percepts
are reconstructed from degraded inputs, and how learning and experience sculpt
olfactory categorical perception. These data show that spatial ensemble activity 
patterns in piriform cortex are closely linked to the perceptual meaning and
identity of odor objects, substantiating theoretical models that emphasize the
importance of distributed templates for the perception, discrimination, and
recall of olfactory quality.

A family of small molecules called ascarosides act as pheromones to control
multiple behaviors in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. At picomolar
concentrations, a synergistic mixture of at least three ascarosides produced by
hermaphrodites causes male-specific attraction. At higher concentrations, the
same ascarosides, perhaps in a different mixture, induce the developmentally
arrested stage known as dauer. The production of ascarosides is strongly
dependent on environmental conditions, although relatively little is known about 
the major variables and mechanisms of their regulation. Thus, male mating and
dauer formation are linked through a common set of small molecules whose
expression is sensitive to a given microenvironment, suggesting a model by which 
ascarosides regulate the overall life cycle of C. elegans.

Belying the apparent ease with which the acoustic world is perceived, the sheer
vastness of the range of sounds and sound parameters that must be encoded
represents a challenge to traditional models of neural coding in audition. Here, 
we review recent evidence suggesting that a process of gain control, operating at
multiple stages in the auditory pathway, helps maintain coding accuracy to
prevailing sound conditions over a wide range of behavioural and sensory
contexts. Together, these processes imbue the system with its staggering
representational capacity, underpinning everything from the perception of a
tiger's near-silent tread to its triumphant roar, demonstrating once more the
principle of efficient coding that underlies sensory processing.

Insects such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, rely on contact
chemosensation to detect nutrient-rich foods, to avoid consuming toxic chemicals,
and to select mates and hospitable zones to deposit eggs. Flies sense tastants
and nonvolatile pheromones through gustatory bristles and pegs distributed on
multiple body parts including the proboscis, wing margins, legs, and ovipositor. 
The sensilla house gustatory receptor neurons, which express members of the
family of 68 gustatory receptors (GRs). In contrast to mammalian chemosensation
or Drosophila olfaction, which are initiated by receptors composed of dimers of
one or two receptor types, the functional Drosophila GRs may include three or
more subunits. Several GRs appear to be expressed in multiple cell types that are
not associated with contact chemosensation raising the possibility that these
proteins may have roles that extend beyond the detection of tastants and
pheromones.

The formation of neural circuits requires molecular mechanisms to confer cell
identity, to establish appropriate dendritic arbors, and to space cell bodies
within the groups of homotypic neurons. Recent work in a variety of organisms has
implicated cell adhesion molecules in these processes. The DSCAMs in particular
have functions including cell identity and self-avoidance through repulsion in
Drosophila, differential adhesion and synaptic pairing in chick retina, and the
masking of adhesion within specific cell types in the mouse retina. These
differences in molecular function between different organisms, and potentially
different cell types within a single tissue, emphasize how seemingly subtle
distinctions may be important for deciphering this molecular adhesion code.

Cerebellar granule cells are an attractive model system for examining synaptic
transmission and temporal integration, because of their small number of
excitatory synaptic inputs and electrotonic compactness. Recent in vivo
whole-cell recordings have revealed how sensory stimuli are represented by
synaptic activity across multiple modalities and cerebellar regions. By
monitoring the activity of individual synapses, the reliability of these unitary 
signals has been quantified, and the complexity of a granule cell's receptive
field has been explored at the highest resolution. Here we describe the emerging 
principles of synaptic sensory representation and their consequences for
information processing in the granule cell layer.

The traditional view of spontaneous neural activity as 'noise' has been
challenged by recent findings suggesting that: (a) spontaneous activity in
cortical populations is highly structured in both space and time, (b) the
spatio-temporal structure of spontaneous activity is linked to the underlying
connectivity of the cortical network, (c) spontaneous cortical activity interacts
with external stimulation to generate responses to the individual presentations
of a stimulus, (d) network connectivity is shaped in part by the statistics of
natural signals and (e) ongoing cortical activity represents a continuous
top-down prediction/expectation signal that interacts with incoming input to
generate an updated representation of the world. These results can be integrated 
to provide a new framework for the study of cortical computation.

Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and oxygen (O(2)) are important cues that can signal the
presence of food, predators, and environmental stress. Here we will review recent
studies on the mechanisms of how the olfactory system detects these two
molecules. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the two molecules are detected 
by subsets of specialized olfactory neurons. In addition, the signal transduction
cascades for sensing these two gases appear to be different from those for
sensing typical odorants. CO(2) and O(2) signals can evoke stereotypical innate
behaviors such as attraction and avoidance in many animal species. Future studies
on the neural pathways underlying CO(2) and O(2) sensing may shed light on the
circuit mechanisms of these behaviors.

Fundamental observations and principles derived from traditional physiological
studies of multisensory integration have been difficult to reconcile with
computational and psychophysical studies that share the foundation of
probabilistic (Bayesian) inference. We review recent work on multisensory
integration, focusing on experiments that bridge single-cell electrophysiology,
psychophysics, and computational principles. These studies show that multisensory
(visual-vestibular) neurons can account for near-optimal cue integration during
the perception of self-motion. Unlike the nonlinear (superadditive) interactions 
emphasized in some previous studies, visual-vestibular neurons accomplish
near-optimal cue integration through subadditive linear summation of their
inputs, consistent with recent computational theories. Important issues remain to
be resolved, including the observation that variations in cue reliability appear 
to change the weights that neurons apply to their different sensory inputs.

Neural activity in cortex is correlated, an observation that has traditionally
been attributed to neurons receiving input from a shared and limited presynaptic 
pool. Recent studies have shown that correlations are also strongly influenced by
network fluctuations that operate over a range of spatial and temporal scales,
extending in some cases across cortical areas. These fluctuations are sensitive
to internal states and external drive, so that correlations themselves depend
strongly on cognitive state and stimulus properties. Given the potential impact
on population coding, this modulation of correlations may play an important role 
in sensory processing.

Gain control in the visual thalamus during perception and cognition.

University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.

The thalamus has traditionally been thought to passively relay sensory
information to the cortex. By showing that responses in visual thalamus are
modulated by perceptual and cognitive tasks, recent fMRI and physiology studies
have helped revise this view. The modulatory input to the visual thalamus derives
from functionally distinct cortical and subcortical feedback pathways. These
pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the
information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements.
Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of
synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity.
These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as
contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.

Controversy and consensus: noncanonical signaling mechanisms in the insect
olfactory system.

York, NY 10065, USA.

There is broad consensus that olfactory signaling in vertebrates and the nematode
C. elegans uses canonical G-protein-coupled receptor transduction pathways. In
contrast, mechanisms of insect olfactory signal transduction remain deeply
controversial. Genetic disruption of G proteins and chemosensory ion channels in 
mice and worms leads to profound impairment in olfaction, while similar mutations
in the fly show more subtle phenotypes. The literature contains contradictory
claims that insect olfaction uses cAMP, cGMP, or IP3 as second messengers; that
insect odorant receptors couple to G(alpha)s or G(alpha)q pathways; and that
insect odorant receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors or odor-gated ion
channels. Here we consider all the evidence and offer a consensus model for a
noncanonical mechanism of olfactory signal transduction in insects.

Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are employed by neurons to alter membrane
excitability and synaptic strength to adapt to changes in network activity.
Recent studies suggest that homeostatic processes can occur not only on a global 
scale but also within specific neuronal subcompartments, involving a wide range
of molecules and signalling pathways. Here, we review new findings into
homeostatic adaptation within dendrites and discuss potential signalling
components and mechanisms that may mediate this local form of regulation.

GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are embedded in almost all central neuronal
networks, where they act to influence cell excitability, spike timing, synchrony,
and oscillatory activity, that is, almost every physiologically relevant process 
in the mammalian central nervous system. Consequently, presynaptic plasticity of 
the synaptic input onto, or the outputs from, a single inhibitory interneuron can
have major ramifications for the activity of the often thousands of downstream
target neurons. Here we discuss several recently described forms of presynaptic
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) occurring at synapses
either made onto inhibitory interneurons, or at inhibitory synapses onto
downstream targets in a number of central structures. As we will illustrate, the 
induction mechanisms underlying these disparate examples of presynaptic
plasticity share few common features, however, their expression mechanisms
converge on the presynaptic release machinery. We hypothesize that these varied
forms of presynaptic plasticity can operate in a manner fundamentally distinct
from most postsynaptic 'point to point' forms of plasticity, to achieve powerful 
modification of the integration and output of large-scale networks.

Presynaptic modulation is a crucial factor in the adaptive capacity of the
nervous system. The coupling between incoming action potentials and
neurotransmitter secretion is modulated by firstly, recent activity of the
presynaptic axon that leads to the accumulation of residual calcium in the
terminal and secondly, activation of presynaptic receptors by external signals.
Despite the detailed description of these phenomena, the underlying mechanisms
are still poorly understood. The nerve terminal contains many Ca(2+)-binding
proteins that may contribute to the translation of residual Ca(2+)-increases to
secretion modulation. We also found that >100 presynaptic proteins are
phosphorylated and may contribute to the translation of presynaptic receptor
activation to secretion modulation. However, which of these many candidates are
the dominant regulators and how their activities integrate is largely unknown.
Here, we review some of the recent insights into the complex interplay between
presynaptic signal transduction components and propose blueprints of the major
pathways.

Until recently we held the simple view that voltage-gated calcium channels
consisted of an alpha1 subunit, usually associated with auxiliary beta subunits
and alpha(2)delta subunits and that skeletal muscle calcium channels were also
associated with a gamma subunit. However, as discussed here, there is now
evidence that the auxiliary subunits may also perform other roles unrelated to
voltage-gated calcium entry. In the past students were taught the simplistic view
that second messenger signaling to voltage-gated calcium channels involved mainly
phosphorylation of L-type calcium channels, Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation via
calmodulin, and direct G-protein-mediated inhibition of the neuronal N and P/Q
channels. However, it is now clear that there are many other means of modulating 
calcium channel activity, including receptor-mediated internalization,
proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation of beta subunits, and interaction of
calcium channels with other proteins, including enzymes masquerading as scaffold 
proteins.

Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

The semaphorins, originally discovered as evolutionarily conserved steering
molecules for developing axons, also influence neuronal structure and function in
the early postnatal and juvenile nervous systems through several refinement
processes. Semaphorins control synaptogenesis, axon pruning, and the density and 
maturation of dendritic spines. In addition, semaphorins and their downstream
signaling components regulate synaptic physiology and neuronal excitability in
the mature hippocampus, and these proteins are also implicated in a number of
developmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Significant inroads 
have been made in defining the mechanisms by which semaphorins regulate dynamic
changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton at the molecular and cellular levels during 
embryonic nervous system development. However, comparatively little is known
about how semaphorins influence neuronal structure and synaptic plasticity during
adult nervous system homeostasis or following injury and disease. A detailed
understanding of how semaphorins function beyond initial phases of neural network
assembly is revealing novel insights into key aspects of nervous system
physiology and pathology.

Visual cortical plasticity can be either rapid, occurring in response to abrupt
changes in neural activity, or slow, occurring over days as a homeostatic process
for adapting neuronal responsiveness. Recent advances have shown that the
magnitude and polarity of rapid synaptic modifications are regulated by
neuromodulators, while homeostatic modifications can occur through regulation of 
cytokine actions or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit composition.
Synaptic and homeostatic plasticity together produce the normal physiological
response to monocular impairments. In vivo studies have now overturned the dogma 
that robust plasticity is limited to an early critical period. Indeed, rapid
physiological plasticity in the adult can be enabled by prior, experience-driven 
anatomical rearrangements or through pharmacological manipulations of the
epigenome.

This brief review focuses on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in plasticity and 
memory formation, and their identification as targets of activity-dependent
regulation in neurons. Epigenetic modifications of chromatin, namely
post-translational modifications of nuclear proteins and covalent modification of
DNA, result in potent regulation of gene readout. Recent data have demonstrated
that epigenetic mechanisms play a significant role in regulating synaptic
plasticity and memory. In this review, we focus on this theme, describing some
basic background concerning epigenetic molecular mechanisms, and describing
recent results concerning plasticity and memory formation. As an understanding of
these novel mechanisms of transcriptional regulation promises to invigorate many 
areas of investigation, we end by speculating upon some of the open questions
ripe for discovery.

The receptor tyrosine kinase Eph and its membrane-bound ligand ephrin are
emerging key players in synapse formation and plasticity in the central nervous
system. Understanding how ephrin/Eph regulate synapse formation and functions is 
often complicated by the fact that both ligands and receptors are expressed in
the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons and upon their interaction,
bi-directional signaling cascades can be triggered. By elucidating the respective
downstream targets and generating signaling-deficient mutants, the specific roles
of forward (Eph receptor) and reverse (ephrin) signaling are beginning to be
unraveled. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of
how ephrin and Eph differentially participate in specific aspects of synapse
formation in developing neurons, and activity-dependent plasticity in the adult
brain.

discuss how synaptic activity controls local translation, the proteins that are
synthesized in dendrites, how they affect synaptic function and how altered local
translational control contributes to a form of human mental retardation, Fragile

Rapid neurotransmission depends on the structural and functional integrity of
synaptic connections. How synapses assemble is currently being intensely
investigated to help our understanding of neuronal development and synaptic
plasticity. Here we focus on the assembly of the presynaptic active zone, which
regulates the synaptic vesicle exo/endo-cycle and is characterized by
ultrastructural specializations and large scaffold proteins. While genetic and
biochemical studies from rodents, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila have
started to identify proteins organizing active zone assembly, drawing a coherent 
picture remains challenging, with genetically established hierarchies and
protein-protein interactions still to be placed into spatio-temporal and
functional context. Recent advances in light and electron microscopy, together
with in vivo imaging of protein traffic, will help to tackle this challenge.

Direction-selective neurons, which respond selectively to motion in one
direction, have been characterized in visual circuits across many species.
Recently, the development of these directional neurons has been explored in both 
retina and primary visual cortex (V1). The development of direction-selective
cells in V1 requires visual experience. In contrast, direction-selective ganglion
cells in retina are present at the age of the earliest light responses. The
vision-independent signals guiding the asymmetric wiring underlying retinal
direction selectivity remain unknown. The details of how retinal and cortical
circuits extract motion information could explain their differing requirements
for visual experience in development.

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, and
perturbed GABA signalling is the underlying cause of many neurological and
psychiatric disorders. Synaptic release of GABA and the functional consequences
of its receptor activation have been studied extensively. However, GABA can also 
be released in unconventional ways. For example, GABA can provide a retrograde
signal, released from parts of the neuron other than the axon terminal.
Alternatively, GABA can be released from neurons or glial cells by the reversal
of transporters, or by other non-vesicular release mechanisms. In this review, we
provide an overview of the recent findings regarding the mechanisms and functions
of unconventionally released GABA and discuss the physiological significance of
such neural regulation.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed on the basis of three behavioral
features namely deficits in social communication, absence or delay in language,
and stereotypy. The susceptibility genes to ASD remain largely unknown, but two
major pathways are emerging. Mutations in TSC1/TSC2, NF1, or PTEN activate the
mTOR/PI3K pathway and lead to syndromic ASD with tuberous sclerosis,
neurofibromatosis, or macrocephaly. Mutations in NLGN3/4, SHANK3, or NRXN1 alter 
synaptic function and lead to mental retardation, typical autism, or Asperger
syndrome. The mTOR/PI3K pathway is associated with abnormal cellular/synaptic
growth rate, whereas the NRXN-NLGN-SHANK pathway is associated with
synaptogenesis and imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory currents. Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that abnormal synaptic homeostasis
represent a risk factor to ASD.

A fine interplay exists between sensory experience and innate genetic programs
leading to the sculpting of neuronal circuits during early brain development.
Recent evidence suggests that the dynamic regulation of gene expression through
epigenetic mechanisms is at the interface between environmental stimuli and long 
lasting molecular, cellular and complex behavioral phenotypes acquired during
periods of developmental plasticity. Understanding these mechanisms may give
insight into the formation of critical periods and provide new strategies for
increasing plasticity and adaptive change in adulthood.

Two genes coding for transcription factors, fruitless and doublesex, have been
suggested to play important roles in the regulation of sexually dimorphic
patterns of social behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. The generalization that
fruitless specified the development of the nervous system and doublesex specified
non-neural tissues culminated with claims that fruitless was both necessary and
sufficient to establish sex-specific patterns of behavior. Several recent
articles refute this notion, however, demonstrating that at a minimum, both
fruitless and doublesex are involved in establishing sexually dimorphic features 
of neural circuitry and behavior in fruit flies.

Brain circuits undergo distributed rearrangements throughout life: development,
experience and behavior constantly modify synaptic strength and network
connectivity. Despite these changes, neurons and circuits need to preserve their 
functional stability. Single neurons maintain their spontaneous firing rate
within functional working ranges by regulating the efficacy of their synaptic
inputs. But how do networks maintain a stable behavior? Is network homeostasis a 
consequence of cell autonomous mechanisms? In this article we will review recent 
evidence showing that network homeostasis is more than the sum of single-neuron
homeostasis and that high-order network stability can be achieved by coordinated 
inter-cellular interactions.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered, extensive class of small noncoding 
RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miRNAs have 
been implicated in most aspects of animal development and in pathological
processes such as cancer. In neurons, miRNAs are expressed at all stages of
development, and we start to learn about their involvement in neuronal
differentiation, synaptogenesis, and plasticity. Moreover, miRNAs likely have a
big impact on higher cognitive functions, and their relevance for the etiology of
prominent neurological disorders is increasingly acknowledged. Future challenges 
include characterizing miRNA regulatory pathways on a system-wide basis, probing 
their relevance for in vivo brain function, and assessing their utility as
molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

Although the auditory system has limited information processing resources, the
acoustic environment is infinitely variable. To properly encode the natural
environment, the developing central auditory system becomes somewhat specialized 
through experience-dependent adaptive mechanisms that operate during a sensitive 
time window. Recent studies have demonstrated that cellular and synaptic
plasticity occurs throughout the central auditory pathway. Acoustic-rearing
experiments can lead to an over-representation of the exposed sound frequency,
and this is associated with specific changes in frequency discrimination. These
forms of cellular plasticity are manifest in brain regions, such as midbrain and 
cortex, which interact through feed-forward and feedback pathways. Hearing loss
leads to a profound re-weighting of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic gain
throughout the auditory CNS, and this is associated with an over-excitability
that is observed in vivo. Further behavioral and computational analyses may
provide insights into how theses cellular and systems plasticity effects underlie
the development of cognitive functions such as speech perception.

Formation, elimination and remodeling of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines 
represent a continuous process that shapes the organization of synaptic networks 
during development. The molecular mechanisms controlling dendritic spine
formation and stabilization therefore critically determine the rules of network
selectivity. Recent studies have identified new molecules, such as Ephrins and
Telencephalin that regulate filopodia motility and their transformation into
dendritic spines. Trans-synaptic signaling involving nitric oxide, protease,
adhesion molecules and Rho GTPases further controls contact formation or the
structural remodeling of spines and their stability. Evidence also suggests that 
activity and induction of plasticity participate to the selection of persistent
spines. Together these new data provide a better understanding of the mechanisms,
speed and steps leading to the establishment of a stable excitatory synapse.

A defining feature of the mammalian nervous system is its complex yet precise
circuitry. The mechanisms which underlie the generation of neural connectivity
are the topic of intense study in developmental neuroscience. The mammalian
visual pathway demonstrates precise retinotopic organization in subcortical and
cortical pathways, together with the alignment and matching of eye-specific
projections, and sophisticated cortical circuitry that enables the extraction of 
features underlying vision. New approaches employing molecular-genetic analyses, 
transgenic mice, novel recombinant probes, and high-resolution imaging are
contributing to rapid progress and a new synthesis in the field. These approaches
are revealing the ways in which intrinsic patterning mechanisms act in concert
with experience-dependent mechanisms to shape visual projections and circuits.

In schizophrenia, a developmental redox dysregulation constitutes one 'hub' on
which converge genetic impairments of glutathione synthesis and environmental
vulnerability factors generating oxidative stress. Their timing at critical
periods of neurodevelopment could play a decisive role in inducing impairment of 
neural connectivity and synchronization as observed in schizophrenia. In
experimental models, such redox dysregulation induces anomalies strikingly
similar to those observed in patients. This is mediated by hypoactive NMDA
receptors, impairment of fast-spiking parvalbumin GABA interneurons and deficit
in myelination. A treatment restoring the redox balance without side effects
yields improvements of negative symptoms in chronic patients. Novel interventions
based on these mechanisms if applied in early phases of the disease hold great
therapeutic promise.

Functional neural circuit formation during postnatal development involves the
elimination of early-formed redundant synapses. In the neonatal mouse cerebellum,
each Purkinje cell is innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs). Their
synaptic strengths are initially uniform but one CF strengthens relative to other
CFs during the first postnatal week. Then the weaker CFs are eliminated during
the second postnatal week. Projections from the retina to the lateral geniculate 
nucleus (LGN) undergo similar developmental changes, that is the elimination of
the majority of inputs and strengthening of a few afferents that remain. Recent
studies have clarified that in both cerebellum and LGN, synapse refinement
consists of multiple phases and that distinct types of neural activity drive
synaptic remodeling in each developmental phase.

Visual system development utilizes global and local cues to assemble a
topographic map of the visual world, arranging synaptic connections into columns 
and layers. Recent genetic studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms
that underlie these processes. In flies, a precise temporal sequence of neural
differentiation provides a global organizing cue; in vertebrates, gradients of
ephrin-mediated signals, acting with neurotrophin co-receptors and neural
activity, play crucial roles. In flies and mice, neural processes tile into
precise arrays through homotypic, repulsive interactions, autocrine signals, and 
cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Laminar targeting specificity is achieved through
temporally regulated cell-cell adhesion, as well as combinatorial expression of
specific adhesion molecules. Future studies will define the interactions between 
these global and local cues.

The functions of the nervous system are mediated by neural circuits that are
formed during development and modulated by experiences. Central to the assembly
of neural circuits is the regulation of synaptic connectivity by synaptic
molecules and neuronal activity. Extensive studies have focused on identifying
molecules involved in synapse formation. Besides factors promoting
synaptogenesis, several antisynaptogenic factors have been discovered. These
factors act in concert to ensure the timing and specificity of circuit formation.
Moreover, progress has been made in revealing how neuronal activity governs the
balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Intriguingly, several
transcription factors, as well as activity-dependent transcription of BDNF
through promoter IV, have been shown to selectively regulate cortical inhibitory 
circuits by promoting GABAergic synapse formation.

Development of epithelial cell polarity and morphogenesis of a central lumen are 
essential prerequisites for the formation of the vertebrate neural tube. In
teleost fish embryos this first involves the formation of a solid neural rod
structure that then undergoes a process of cavitation to form a lumen. This
process is initiated from a neural plate that has a distinct organization
compared to other vertebrates, and involves complex cell intercalations and
rearrangements. A key element is a mode of polarized cell division that generates
daughters with mirror-image apico-basal polarity. These mirror-symmetric
divisions have powerful morphogenetic influence because when they occur in
ectopic locations they orchestrate the development of ectopic apical and basal
specializations and the development of ectopic neural tubes.

Studies of developmental cell death in the nervous system have revealed two
different modes of programmed cell death (PCD). One results from competition for 
target-derived trophic factors and leads to the stochastic removal of neurons
and/or glia. A second, hard-wired form of PCD involves the lineage-specific,
stereotypical death of identifiable neurons, glia or undifferentiated cells.
Although traditionally associated with invertebrates, this 'programmed PCD' can
also occur in vertebrates. Recent studies have shed light on its genetic control 
and have revealed that activation of the apoptotic machinery can be under the
same complex, combinatorial control as the expression of terminal differentiation
genes. This review will highlight these findings and will suggest why such
complex control evolved.

Recent advances have revealed that modification of chromatin structure is an
important determinant of cell fate and function. DNA methylation and covalent
modifications of histone tails contribute to changes in chromatin architectures, 
either enhancing or repressing gene expression. Another mechanism underlying the 
modification of chromatin structure relies on the activity of the SWI/SNF-related
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that control the accessibility of
DNA sequences to transcription factors. There is increasing evidence that
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes based on the alternative
DNA-dependent ATPases, Brg1 and Brm, plays essential roles during neural
development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. This remodeling complex has
dedicated functions at different stages of neural development that appear to
arise by combinatorial assembly of its subunits.

In the developing brain, the tangential mode of migration appears as an efficient
strategy for newly generated neurons to reach destinations that are far away from
their site of origin, as opposed to local migration along radial glia process.
The ganglionic eminence, in the vertebrate subpallium, is the main source of
tangentially migrating neurons in the forebrain. However, little is known about
the transcriptional control of such long-distance tangential migrations. Here, we
review recent findings showing that homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (TFs) 
regulate the tangential migration of telencephalic neurons through the expression
of several downstream targets including other TFs, axon guidance molecules, and
cytoskeletal components. This molecular mechanism also seems to apply to
tangentially migrating neurons in other parts of the brain.

Spatial and temporal specification of neural progenitor cells is integral to
their production of a wide variety of central nervous system (CNS) cells. For a
given region, cells arise on a precise and predictable temporal schedule, with
sub-types of neurons appearing in a defined order, followed by glial cell
generation. Single cell studies have shown that the timing of cell generation can
be encoded within individual early progenitor cells as a cell-intrinsic program. 
Environmental cues are important modulators of this program, allowing it to
unfold and coordinating the process within the embryo. Here we review recent
findings on the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic and transcription factor
regulation, which are involved in temporal specification of CNS stem cells.

Comparative metacognition.

Metacognition is knowledge about knowledge, often expressed as confidence
judgments about what we know. Most of the literature on metacognition in humans
is based on subjects' verbal reports. Investigators of animal cognition have
recently described nonverbal methods for investigating metacognition in animals. 
In one, subjects are given the option to escape from difficult trials. In
another, subjects are trained to place bets about the accuracy of their most
recent response. To rule out noncognitive interpretations of purported evidence
of metacognition in animals, one must ensure that escape responses do not
increase the overall density of reinforcement and that they do not occur in the
presence of the stimuli on which the subject was trained. The nonverbal
techniques used to investigate metacognition in animals make possible two
interesting lines of research: investigating the contribution of language and
explicit instruction in establishing metacognition, and the investigation of the 
neural substrates of metacognition.

Over the past few decades, research in judgment and decision-making has revealed 
that decision-makers, though not always rational, are often quite predictable.
Here, we attempt to explore the nature of this systematicity with a different
approach to decision-making. Specifically, we propose that some of the
systematicity of human decision-making may result from the operation of core
knowledge mechanisms, domain-specific learning mechanisms with characteristic
processing limitations. In this review, we describe the core knowledge approach
and argue that at least some aspects of human decision-making have the signature 
characteristics of a core knowledge system, namely, such strategies develop early
in ontogeny and are shared with closely related primate relatives.

Taking a real look at social attention.

Author information:

The eyes of others are important to us, and we care about where they are
directed. Lab-based studies often fail to capture this intuition because the
studies are so simple and controlled that the situational complexity that is
critical to social attention is lost. A research approach called cognitive
ethology begins its investigation at the level of naturally occurring phenomena
before moving into the lab. In doing so one can maintain the link between lab
research and the phenomena it seeks to understand. Instances of lab failures that
are offset by a cognitive ethology approach are presented and discussed.

Functional understanding facilitates learning about tools in human children.

Human children benefit from a possibly unique set of adaptations facilitating the
acquisition of knowledge about material culture. They represent artifacts
(human-made objects) as tools with specific functions and seek for functional
information about novel objects. Even young infants pay attention to functionally
relevant features of objects, and learn tool use and infer tool functions from
others' goal-directed actions and demonstrations. Children tend to imitate
causally irrelevant elements of tool use demonstrations, which helps them to
acquire means actions even before they fully understand their causal role in
bringing about the desired goal. Although non-human animals use and make tools,
and recognize causally relevant features of objects in a given task, they -
unlike human children - do not appear to form enduring functional representations
of tools as being for achieving particular goals when they are not in use.

Prefrontal cortex and the evolution of symbolic reference.

Symbol systems such as numbers and language are of paramount importance to human 
cognition. In number theory, numbers are symbolic signs embedded in a system of
higher-order sign-sign relations. During ontogeny, numerical competence passes
through different referential sign relations with increasing complexity, from an 
iconic to an indexical and finally symbolic stage. Animals such as nonhuman
primates are constrained to indexical reference. However, because symbolic
reference emerges from indexical reference, behavioral and neuronal
representations of semantic sign-numerosity associations in animals can elucidate
the precursors of symbol systems. A neurobiological explanation of how numerical 
signs take their meaning is proposed by suggesting that neurons in the granular
prefrontal cortex, a novel brain structure evolved in primates, enable high-order
associations and establish links between nonsymbolic numerosities and arbitrary
signs.

This paper aims to summarize the existing evidence for the symbolic
representation of number in chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can represent, to some
extent, both the cardinal and the ordinal aspect of number. Through the medium of
Arabic numerals we compared working memory in humans and chimpanzees using the
same apparatus and following the same procedure. Three young chimpanzees
outperformed human adults in memorizing briefly presented numerals. However, we
found that chimpanzees were less proficient at a variety of other cognitive tasks
including imitation, cross-modal matching, symmetry of symbols and referents, and
one-to-one correspondence. In sum, chimpanzees do not possess human-like
capabilities for representation at an abstract level. The present paper will
discuss the constraints of the number concept in chimpanzees, and illuminate some
unique features of human cognition.

Neural representation of behavioral outcomes in the orbitofrontal cortex.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important in processing rewards and other
behavioral outcomes. Here, we review from a computational perspective recent
progress in understanding this complex function. OFC neurons appear to represent 
abstract outcome values, which may facilitate the comparison of options, as well 
as concrete outcome attributes, such as flavor or location, which may enable
predictive cues to access current outcome values in the face of dynamic
modulation by internal state, context and learning. OFC can use reinforcement
learning to generate outcome predictions; it can also generate outcome
predictions using other mechanisms, including the evaluation of decision
confidence or uncertainty. OFC neurons encode not only the mean expected outcome 
but also the variance, consistent with the idea that OFC uses a probabilistic
population code to represent outcomes. We suggest that further attention to the
nature of its representations and algorithms will be critical to further
elucidating OFC function.

Looking past the model species: diversity in gaze-following skills across

Primates must navigate complex social landscapes in their daily lives: gathering 
information from and about others, competing with others for food and mates, and 
cooperating to obtain rewards as well. Gaze-following often provides important
clues as to what others see, know, or will do; using information about social
attention is thus crucial for primates to be competent social actors. However,
the cognitive bases of the gaze-following behaviors that primates exhibit appear 
to vary widely across species. The ultimate challenge of such analyses will
therefore be to understand why such different cognitive mechanisms have evolved
across species.

General mechanisms for making decisions?

It has been suggested that many aspects of reward-guided behaviour can be
understood within the framework of a computational account of decision making.
The account emphasises representation of expectations about decision outcomes and
the revision of future expectations in the light of the prediction error-the
discrepancy between the actual outcome and prior expectation. Frontal cortex and 
striatum are implicated in such processes in humans, monkeys, and rats suggesting
they are ubiquitous and found in many species. Disagreement remains over the
exact contribution made by each brain region. A growing body of work even
suggests analogous processes may account for behaviour outside the domain of
reward-guided decision making, for example, when people and animals learn about
visual and social environments.

Intention understanding emerges early in human development, manifest in deep and 
robust fashions even in infants. Overlapping intention understandings,
encompassing agents as intentional actors and experiencers, are evident in
nonhuman primates in more limited fashions. Intention understandings, of the sort
shared by infants and nonhuman primates, predict the more comprehensive
theory-of-mind understandings of older children. Those early understandings
provide a platform for the ontogenesis of further, deeper achievements in the
human case.

Recent monkey studies provide intriguing information for an open question whether
face processing is a special perceptual process and is organized as such at
birth, or has its origin in a more general system that becomes specialized with
experience. Before seeing any faces or face-like objects, macaque monkeys showed 
a preference for faces rather than nonface objects. Furthermore, they showed
remarkable face processing abilities both for human and monkey faces. It was also
shown that macaque newborns are able to imitate human facial gestures, indicating
the ability to match their own facial movements to observed facial gestures.
Taken together, it seems very likely that newborns can acquire the knowledge
about the basic structure of their own face, presumably through proprioception,
so that facial structure would become a familiar and attractive visual object
without the experience of the face itself.

In the wild, chimpanzees are the most prolific and proficient tool users, yet
their understanding of tools in the laboratory is surprisingly poor. Although
this apparent lack of understanding might be interpreted as a reflection of a
general failure of animals to appreciate 'folk physics', recent studies suggest
that some non-tool using species perform rather well on such laboratory tasks. In
some animals, tool use and manufacture may also engage aspects of planning, but
some non-tool using species have also been shown to demonstrate prospective
cognition. Consequently, we argue that habitual tool use is not a clear predictor
of physical intelligence, for either instrumental tool tasks or tests of
planning.

We review growing evidence that the reorientation system-shared by both humans
and nonhuman species-privileges geometric representations of space and exhibits
many of the characteristic features of modular systems. We also review evidence
showing that humans can move beyond the limits of nonhuman species by using two
cultural constructions, language and explicit maps. We argue that, although both 
of these constructions are uniquely human means of enriching the spatial system
we share with other species, their representational formats, functions, and
developmental trajectories are quite different, yielding distinctly different
tools for empowering human spatial cognition.The capacity to reorient using
geometry is present in humans by the age of 18 months.

The issue of whether encoding of geometric information for navigational purposes 
crucially depends on environmental experience or whether it is innately
predisposed in the brain has been recently addressed in controlled rearing
studies. Non-human animals can make use of the geometric shape of an environment 
for spatial reorientation and in some circumstances reliance on purely geometric 
information (metric properties and sense) can overcome use of local featural
information. Animals reared in home cages of different geometric shapes proved to
be equally capable of learning and performing navigational tasks based on
geometric information. The findings suggest that effective use of geometric
information for spatial reorientation does not require experience in environments
with right angles and metrically distinct surfaces.

Macaque monkeys are widely used in order to understand the mechanisms of the
human brain. But humans have capacities not found in monkeys, and their brains
differ in important ways, for example in the proportions of different regions and
in microstructure. However, this does not mean that we must abandon the monkey
model, only that wherever possible, we should test whether generalizations can be
made. One strategy is to use fMRI to visualize activations in humans, and compare
these with activations in monkeys. Where the results are the same, we can then
use information from single unit recording in those areas to suggest the
mechanisms by which those areas perform their functions in the human brain.

The observation of biological processes in their natural in vivo context is a key
requirement for quantitative experimental studies in the life sciences. In many
instances, it will be crucial to achieve high temporal and spatial resolution
over long periods of time without compromising the physiological development of
the specimen. Here, we discuss the principles underlying light sheet-based
fluorescence microscopes. The most recent implementation DSLM is a tool optimized
to deliver quantitative data for entire embryos at high spatio-temporal
resolution. We compare DSLM to the two established light microscopy techniques:
confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. DSLM provides up to 50 times
higher imaging speeds and a 10-100 times higher signal-to-noise ratio, while
exposing the specimens to at least three orders of magnitude less light energy
than confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopes. We conclude with a
perspective for future development.

Neurobiological processes occur on spatiotemporal scales spanning many orders of 
magnitude. Greater understanding of these processes therefore demands
improvements in the tools used in their study. Here we review recent efforts to
enhance the speed and resolution of one such tool, fluorescence microscopy, with 
an eye toward its application to neurobiological problems. On the speed front,
improvements in beam scanning technology, signal generation rates, and
photodamage mediation are bringing us closer to the goal of real-time functional 
imaging of extended neural networks. With regard to resolution, emerging methods 
of adaptive optics may lead to diffraction-limited imaging or much deeper imaging
in optically inhomogeneous tissues, and super-resolution techniques may prove a
powerful adjunct to electron microscopic methods for nanometric neural circuit
reconstruction.

Recent technological developments have renewed the interest in large-scale neural
circuit reconstruction. To resolve the structure of entire circuits, thousands of
neurons must be reconstructed and their synapses identified. Reconstruction
techniques at the light microscopic level are capable of following sparsely
labeled neurites over long distances, but fail with densely labeled neuropil.
Electron microscopy provides the resolution required to resolve densely stained
neuropil, but is challenged when data for volumes large enough to contain
complete circuits need to be collected. Both photon-based and electron-based
imaging methods will ultimately need highly automated data analysis, because the 
manual tracing of most networks of interest would require hundreds to tens of
thousands of years in human labor.

Because neurotropic viruses naturally traverse neural pathways, they are
extremely valuable for elucidating neural circuits. Naturally occurring herpes
and rabies viruses have been used for transneuronal circuit tracing for decades. 
Depending on the type of virus and strain, virus can travel preferentially in the
anterograde or the retrograde direction. More recently, genetic modifications
have allowed for many improvements. These include: reduced pathogenicity;
addition of marker genes; control of synaptic spread; pseudotyping for infection 
of selected cells; addition of ancillary genetic elements for combining circuit
tracing with manipulation of activity or functional assays. These modifications, 
along with the likelihood of future developments, suggest that neurotropic
viruses will be increasingly important and effective tools for future studies of 
neural circuits.

Many neuroscience studies of arm control have attempted to explain how aimed
movements are planned, generated, and corrected. The mechanisms of subconscious
online reaching correction to a target shift are now being widely examined from
computational, physiological, and pathological viewpoints. Recent evidence of a
quick manual response to surrounding visual motion suggests an additional online 
compensatory mechanism in reaching movements for bodily and/or external
environmental changes, although the computational principle underlying this
process remains controversial. Together with preprogrammed voluntary motor
command generation, it appears that multiple online visually guided correction
mechanisms implicitly govern reaching control to bring the hand to the goal. It
is important to reveal unknown mechanisms and underlying neural substrates of
generating the response to visual motion, which is additionally modulated by
action contexts.

Our knowledge on the functions of the basal ganglia has increased enormously
during the last two decades. However, we still do not completely understand the
primary function of the basal ganglia. In this article, I review fundamental
problems on the basal ganglia that have emerged from recent findings, and propose
their solutions in the following seven topics: first, organization of the
cortico-basal ganglia loop, second, limitations of the 'direct and indirect
pathways model', third, feedforward inhibition in the striatum, fourth,
contribution of the basal ganglia to cortical activity through the thalamus,
fifth, focused selection of movements and learning, sixth, firing rate model
versus firing pattern model for the pathophysiology of movement disorders, and
lastly mechanisms of stereotaxic surgery.

Interacting with objects in the environment introduces several new challenges for
motor control: the potential for instability, external constraints on possible
motions and novel dynamics. Grasping and manipulating objects provide the most
elaborate examples of such motor tasks. We review each of these topics and
suggest that when sensory feedback is reliable, it is used to adapt the motion to
the requirements imposed by the object. When sensory feedback is unreliable,
subjects adapt the stiffness of muscles and joints to the task's requirements.
One of the simplifications introduced in the control of such movements is a
reduction in the effective number of degrees of freedom (sensorimotor axes and
muscle synergies) and recent findings and methodological considerations relevant 
to this topic are discussed.

A central question in neuroscience is how interactions between neurons give rise 
to behavior. In many electrophysiological experiments, the activity of a set of
neurons is recorded while sensory stimuli or movement tasks are varied. Tools
that aim to reveal underlying interactions between neurons from such data can be 
extremely useful. Traditionally, neuroscientists have studied these interactions 
using purely descriptive statistics (cross-correlograms or joint peri-stimulus
time histograms). However, the interpretation of such data is often difficult,
particularly as the number of recorded neurons grows. Recent research suggests
that model-based, maximum likelihood methods can improve these analyses. In
addition to estimating neural interactions, application of these techniques has
improved decoding of external variables, created novel interpretations of
existing electrophysiological data, and may provide new insight into how the
brain represents information.

On the importance of the transient visual response in the superior colliculus.

Canada.

A salient event in the environment can initiate a complex orienting response that
includes a shift in gaze. The midbrain superior colliculus (SC) contains the
appropriate circuitry to generate and distribute a signal of the priority of this
event, and co-ordinate the orienting response. The magnitude and timing of the
short-latency transient visual response in the SC, when combined with cortical
inputs signaling stimulus relevance and expectation, influences the type and
latency of the orienting response. This signal in the SC is distributed to higher
cortical areas to influence visual processing, to the reinforcement learning
system to influence future actions, and to premotor circuits, including neck and 
shoulder muscles, to influence immediate action.

The neural basis of the internal models used in sensorimotor transformations is
beginning to be uncovered. Sensorimotor learning involves the modification of
such models. Different stages of sensory-motor processing have been explored with
a continuum of experimental tasks, from learning arbitrary associations of
sensory cues to movements, to adapting to altered kinematic and dynamic
environments. Several groups have been studying changes in neuronal activity in
cortical and subcortical areas that may be related to the acquisition and
consolidation processes. We discuss the progress and challenges in understanding 
how these learning-related neural changes are involved in the modification of
internal models, and offer future directions.

Movements are necessary to engage the world, but every movement results in
sensorimotor ambiguity. Self-movements cause changes to sensory inflow as well as
changes in the positions of objects relative to motor effectors (eyes and limbs).
Hence the brain needs to monitor self-movements, and one way this is accomplished
is by routing copies of movement commands to appropriate structures. These
signals, known as corollary discharge (CD), enable compensation for sensory
consequences of movement and preemptive updating of spatial representations. Such
operations occur with a speed and accuracy that implies a reliance on prediction.
Here we review recent CD studies and find that they arrive at a shared
conclusion: CD contributes to prediction for the sake of sensorimotor harmony.

Canonically, 'mirror neurons' are cells in area F5 of the ventral premotor cortex
that are active during both observation and execution of goal-directed movements.
Recently, cells with similar properties have been observed in a number of other
areas in the motor system, including the primary motor cortex. Mirror neurons are
a part of a system whose function is thought to involve the prediction and
interpretation of the sensory consequences of our own actions as well as the
actions of others. Mirror-like responses are relevant to the development of
brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) because they provide a robust way to map neural
activity to behavior, and because they represent high-level information about
goals and intentions that may have utility in future BMI applications.

From invertebrates to mammals, cell-cycle progression during an asymmetric cell
division is accompanied by precisely timed redistribution of cell-fate
determinants so that they segregate asymmetrically to enable the two daughter
cells to choose different fates. Interestingly, studies on how cell fates are
specified in such divisions reveal that the same fate determinants can be
reiteratively used to specify a variety of cell types through multiple rounds of 
cell divisions or to exert seemingly contradictory effects on cell proliferation 
and differentiation. Here I summarize the molecular mechanisms governing
asymmetric cell division and review recent findings pointing to a novel mechanism
for coupling intracellular signaling and cell-cycle progression. This mechanism
uses changes in the morphology, subcellular distribution, and molecular
composition of cellular organelles like the Golgi apparatus and centrosomes,
which not only accompany the progression of cell cycle to activate but also
temporally constrain the activity of fate determinants during asymmetric cell
divisions.

The mechanisms for delivering components to nerve terminals are diverse and
highly regulated. The diversity of kinesin motors alone is insufficient to
account for the specificity of delivery. Additional specificity and control are
contributed by adaptor proteins and associated regulatory molecules. The
interaction of cargos with these complexes can confer distinct behaviors on the
transport of synaptic organelles. The rich regulatory mechanisms of transport
that are only now emerging as the cargo-motor complexes are defined and
subsequent local events that regulate their dynamic relationship are examined.
Here we review recent studies of kinesin-related axonal transport of three
crucial synaptic components, Piccolo-bassoon Transport Vesicles (PTVs), Synaptic 
Vesicle Precursors (SVPs), and mitochondria, and the mechanisms that modulate
their transport.

Martinsried, Germany.

The formation of an axon and dendrites, neuronal polarization, is a prerequisite 
for neurons to integrate and propagate information within the brain. During the
past years progress has been made toward understanding the initial stage of
neuronal polarization, axon formation. First, the physiological role of some
candidate regulators of neuronal polarity has been affirmed, including Sad
kinases, the Rho-GTPase Cdc42, and the actin regulators Ena/VASP proteins.
Second, recent studies have revealed microtubule stabilization as a mechanism
complementary to actin dynamics underlying neuronal polarization. Moreover,
stable microtubules in the axon may form a landmark to confer identity to the
axon. This review highlights the recent advances in understanding the
intracellular mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization and discusses them in
the context of putative cytoskeletal effectors.

Ribonucleoprotein complexes in neurologic diseases.

Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes regulate the tissue-specific RNA processing and
transport that increases the coding capacity of our genome and the ability to
respond quickly and precisely to the diverse set of signals. This review focuses 
on three proteins that are part of RNP complexes in most cells of our body: TAR
DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), the survival motor neuron protein (SMN), and
fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In particular, the review asks the
question why these ubiquitous proteins are primarily associated with defects in
specific regions of the central nervous system? To understand this question, it
is important to understand the role of genetic and cellular environment in
causing the defect in the protein, as well as how the defective protein leads to 
misregulation of specific target RNAs. Two approaches for comprehensive analysis 
of defective RNA-protein interactions are presented. The first approach defines
the RNA code or the collection of proteins that bind to a certain cis-acting RNA 
site in order to lead to a predictable outcome. The second approach defines the
RNA map or the summary of positions on target RNAs where binding of a particular 
RNA-binding protein leads to a predictable outcome. As we learn more about the
RNA codes and maps that guide the action of the dynamic RNP world in our brain,
possibilities for new treatments of neurologic diseases are bound to emerge.

Glial cells, which include myelinating oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells and
astrocytes, fulfil a large variety of functions that are critical for the
development, functioning and regeneration of neurons. Some of these glial
functions have been shown to require polarization of the intracellular machinery.
Although the initial signals leading to glial cell polarization during
development and in the adult are not completely elucidated, crucial molecules
such as proteins of the extracellular matrix and their membrane receptors have
been identified. A general picture of the intracellular signalling pathways
controlling polarity in glial cells is also emerging and shows that highly
conserved and ubiquitously expressed polarity proteins are involved.

Neurons are complex differentiated cells with specialised, polarised membrane
domains. Their function and viability is intimately linked to the availability of
trophic factors, but ultimately depends on active membrane transport connecting
axons and dendrites with the distant cell body. Neurons, because of their extreme
polarisation, size and post-mitotic nature may be uniquely sensitive to the
accumulation of damaged or aggregated cytosolic proteins, or membranes, and rely 
on autophagy for survival. Autophagy is a highly conserved, ubiquitous lysosomal 
degradative process, which plays an important role in cell homeostasis in both
normal growth settings, and abnormal, stressful conditions. Although recent
evidence supports this assumption, how autophagy protects cells from damage
leading to neurodegeneration is not yet clear.

Modulation of local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites plays a key role in
the production of long-term, activity-dependent changes in synapse structure and 
functional efficacy. Such long-term changes also require regulation of actin
dynamics in dendritic spines. Recent evidence couples local protein synthesis to 
regulation of actin dynamics in long-term synaptic plasticity. Translation of the
dendritically localized mRNA, Arc, is required for consolidation of LTP and
stabilization of nascent polymerized actin. BDNF signaling activates
Arc-dependent LTP consolidation and is required for actin polymerization and
stable expansion of dendritic spines during LTP. Regulation of actin pools within
dendritic spines modulates spine size and enlargement, organization of the
postsynaptic density, receptor trafficking, and localization of the translational
machinery.

The activity of neurotransmitter receptors determines the strength of synaptic
transmission. Therefore, the clustering of receptors at synapses is an important 
mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity. The dynamic exchange of receptors
between synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes is dependent on their interaction
with synaptic scaffold proteins. Here, we review the recent advances and emerging
concepts related to the dynamics of synaptic proteins at inhibitory and
excitatory synapses. These include the imaging techniques that enable the study
of protein dynamics in cells, the differences and similarities of receptor
dynamics at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, the relationship between the
exchange of receptor and scaffold proteins, as well as the role of receptor
fluxes in the modulation of synaptic strength.

The mammalian inner ear largely lacks the capacity to regenerate hair cells, the 
sensory cells required for hearing and balance. Recent studies in both lower
vertebrates and mammals have uncovered genes and pathways important in hair cell 
development and have suggested ways that the sensory epithelia could be
manipulated to achieve hair cell regeneration. These approaches include the use
of inner ear stem cells, transdifferentiation of nonsensory cells, and induction 
of a proliferative response in the cells that can become hair cells.

Crowding: a cortical constraint on object recognition.

The external world is mapped retinotopically onto the primary visual cortex (V1).
We show here that objects in the world, unless they are very dissimilar, can be
recognized only if they are sufficiently separated in visual cortex:
specifically, in V1, at least 6mm apart in the radial direction (increasing
eccentricity) or 1mm apart in the circumferential direction (equal eccentricity).
Objects closer together than this critical spacing are perceived as an
unidentifiable jumble. This is called 'crowding'. It severely limits visual
processing, including speed of reading and searching. The conclusion about visual
cortex rests on three findings. First, psychophysically, the necessary 'critical'
spacing, in the visual field, is proportional to (roughly half) the eccentricity 
of the objects. Second, the critical spacing is independent of the size and kind 
of object. Third, anatomically, the representation of the visual field on the
cortical surface is such that the position in V1 (and several other areas) is the
logarithm of eccentricity in the visual field. Furthermore, we show that much of 
this can be accounted for by supposing that each 'combining field', defined by
the critical spacing measurements, is implemented by a fixed number of cortical
neurons.

Noninvasive brain imaging has established the participation of the cortex in pain
perception and identified a long list of brain structures involved. More recent
studies show the interaction between clinical chronic pain conditions and the
reorganization of the brain functionally, anatomically, and chemically.
Mechanisms underlying this reorganization hint to essential links between pain,
especially its affective component with emotional learning and memory. This
review is a discussion of the rationale and evidence for the interaction between 
these modalities, emphasizing underlying mechanisms.

Synchronized firing in the retina.

Synchronized firing in neural populations has been proposed to constitute an
elementary aspect of the neural code, but a complete understanding of its origins
and significance has been elusive. Synchronized firing has been extensively
documented in retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. However, 
differences in synchronized firing across species and cell types have led to
varied conclusions about its mechanisms and role in visual signaling. Recent work
on two identified cell populations in the primate retina, the ON-parasol and
OFF-parasol cells, permits a more unified understanding. Intracellular recordings
reveal that synchronized firing in these cell types arises primarily from common 
synaptic input to adjacent pairs of cells. Statistical analysis indicates that
local pairwise interactions can explain the pattern of synchronized firing in the
entire parasol cell population. Computational analysis reveals that the aggregate
impact of synchronized firing on the visual signal is substantial. Thus, in the
parasol cells, the origin and impact of synchronized firing on the neural code
may be understood as locally shared input which influences the visual signals
transmitted from eye to brain.

Olfaction consists of a set of transforms from a physical space of odorant
molecules, through a neural space of information processing, and into a
perceptual space of smell. Elucidating the rules governing these transforms
depends on establishing valid metrics for each of the three spaces. Here we first
briefly review the perceptual and neural spaces, and then concentrate on the
physical space of odorant molecules. We argue that the lack of an agreed-upon
odor metric poses a significant obstacle toward understanding the neurobiology of
olfaction, and suggest two alternative odor metrics as possible solutions.

This review will cover advances in the study of hair cell afferent synaptic
function occurring between 2005 and 2008. During this time, capacitance
measurements of vesicular fusion have continued to be refined, optical methods
have added insights regarding vesicle trafficking, and paired intracellular
recordings have established the transfer function of the afferent synapse at high
resolution. Further, genes have been identified with forms of deafness known as
auditory neuropathy, and their role in afferent signaling explored in mouse
models. With these advances, our view of the hair cell afferent synapse has
continued to be refined, and surprising properties have been revealed that
emphasize the unique role of this structure in neural function.

The perception of music depends on many culture-specific factors, but is also
constrained by properties of the auditory system. This has been best
characterized for those aspects of music that involve pitch. Pitch sequences are 
heard in terms of relative as well as absolute pitch. Pitch combinations give
rise to emergent properties not present in the component notes. In this review we
discuss the basic auditory mechanisms contributing to these and other perceptual 
effects in music.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are crucial determinants of neuronal excitability
and signalling; some specific channel subtypes have been implicated in a number
of chronic pain conditions. Human genetic studies show gain-of-function or
loss-of-function mutations in Na(V)1.7 lead to an enhancement or lack of pain,
respectively, whilst transgenic mouse and knockdown studies have implicated
Na(V)1.3, Na(V)1.8 and Na(V)1.9 in peripheral pain pathways. The development of
subtype-specific sodium channel blockers, though clearly desirable, has been
technically challenging. Recent advances exploiting both natural products and
small molecule selective channel blockers have demonstrated that this approach to
pain control is feasible. These observations provide a rationale for the
development of new analgesics without the side effect profile of broad spectrum
sodium channel blockers.

Representation of binocular surfaces by cortical neurons.

Useful representations of the three-dimensional (3D) world go beyond assigning
depth to individual points, building maps of surfaces and shapes. Studies in a
wide range of extrastriate cortical areas have shown that single neurons show
selective responses to 3D surfaces. The extent to which this advances the
representation beyond that provided by the earliest binocular signals requires
careful evaluation. We conclude that current data are not sufficient to identify 
distinctive contributions from different cortical areas to the binocular
representation of 3D surfaces.

Mechanical amplification of acoustic signals is apparently a common feature of
vertebrate auditory organs. In non-mammalian vertebrates amplification is
produced by stereociliary processes, related to the mechanotransducer channel
complex and probably to the phenomenon of fast adaptation. The extended frequency
range of the mammalian cochlea has probably co-evolved with a novel hair cell
type, the outer hair cell and its constituent membrane protein, prestin.
Cylindrical outer hair cells are motile and their somatic length changes are
voltage driven and powered by prestin. One of the central outstanding problems in
mammalian cochlear neurobiology is the relation between the two amplification
processes.

A hallmark of higher brain functions is the ability to contemplate the world
rather than to respond reflexively to it. To do so, the nervous system makes use 
of a modular architecture in which sensory representations are dissociated from
areas that control actions. This flexibility however necessitates a recoding
scheme that would put sensory information to use in the control of behavior.
Sensory recoding faces two important challenges. First, recoding must take into
account the inherent variability of sensory responses. Second, it must be
flexible enough to satisfy the requirements of different perceptual goals. Recent
progress in theory, psychophysics, and neurophysiology indicate that cortical
circuitry might meet these challenges by evaluating sensory signals
probabilistically.

Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have challenged existing models of olfactory 
processing in the vertebrate olfactory bulb and insect antennal lobe. Whereas
lateral connectivity between olfactory glomeruli was previously thought to form a
dense, topographically organized inhibitory surround, new evidence suggests that 
lateral connections may be sparse, nontopographic, and partly excitatory. Other
recent studies highlight the role of active sensing (sniffing) in shaping
odor-evoked neural activity and perception.

Studies show that while the cortical mechanisms of two-dimensional (2D) form and 
motion processing are similar in touch and vision, the mechanisms of
three-dimensional (3D) shape processing are different. 2D form and motion are
processed in areas 3b and 1 of SI cortex by neurons with receptive fields (RFs)
composed of excitatory and inhibitory subregions. 3D shape is processed in area 2
and SII and relies on the integration of cutaneous and proprioceptive inputs. The
RFs of SII neurons vary in size and shape with heterogeneous structures
consisting of orientation-tuned fingerpads mixed with untuned excitatory or
inhibitory fingerpads. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the neurons to cutaneous
inputs changes with hand conformation. We hypothesize that these RFs are the
kernels underlying tactile object recognition.

Although it is now generally accepted that the thalamus is more than a simple
relay of sensory signals to the cortex, we are just beginning to gain an
understanding of how corticothalamic feedback influences sensory processing.
Results from an increasing number of studies across sensory systems and different
species reveal effects of feedback both on the receptive fields of thalamic
neurons and on the transmission of sensory information between the thalamus and
cortex. Importantly, these studies demonstrate that the cortico-thalamic
projection cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be considered as an integral
part of a thalamo-corticothalamic circuit which intimately interconnects the
thalamus and cortex for sensory processing.

The coding of complex sounds in the early auditory system has a 'standard model' 
based on the known physiology of the cochlea and main brainstem pathways. This
model accounts for a wide range of perceptual capabilities. It is generally
accepted that high cortical areas encode abstract qualities such as spatial
location or speech sound identity. Between the early and late auditory system,
the role of primary auditory cortex (A1) is still debated. A1 is clearly much
more than a 'whiteboard' of acoustic information-neurons in A1 have complex
response properties, showing sensitivity to both low-level and high-level
features of sounds.

Chemical sensing begins when peripheral receptor proteins recognise specific
environmental stimuli and translate them into spatial and temporal patterns of
sensory neuron activity. The chemosensory system of the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster, has become a dominant model to understand this process, through its
accessibility to a powerful combination of molecular, genetic and
electrophysiological analysis. Recent results have revealed many surprises in the
biology of peripheral chemosensation in Drosophila, including novel structural
and signalling properties of the insect odorant receptors (ORs), combinatorial
mechanisms of chemical recognition by the gustatory receptors (GRs), and the
implication of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels as a novel class
of chemosensory receptors.

Synaptic clustering by dendritic signalling mechanisms.

Larkum ME(1), Nevian T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of Berne, Bern, Switzerland.

Dendritic signal integration is one of the fundamental building blocks of
information processing in the brain. Dendrites are endowed with mechanisms of
nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs leading to regenerative dendritic events
including local sodium, NMDA and calcium spikes. The generation of these events
requires distinct spatio-temporal activation patterns of synaptic inputs. We
hypothesise that the recent findings on dendritic spikes and local synaptic
plasticity rules suggest clustering of common inputs along a subregion of a
dendritic branch. These clusters may enable dendrites to separately threshold
groups of functionally similar inputs, thus allowing single neurons to act as a
superposition of many separate integrate and fire units. Ultimately, these
properties expand our understanding about the computational power of neuronal
networks.

Some neuroscientists argue that detailed maps of synaptic connectivity--wiring
diagrams--will be needed if we are to understand how the brain underlies behavior
and how brain malfunctions underlie behavioral disorders. Such large-scale
circuit reconstruction, which has been called connectomics, may soon be possible,
owing to numerous advances in technologies for image acquisition and processing. 
Yet, the community is divided on the feasibility and value of the enterprise.
Remarkably similar objections were voiced when the Human Genome Project, now
widely viewed as a success, was first proposed. We revisit that controversy to
ask if it holds any lessons for proposals to map the connectome.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) function as retrograde messengers at both excitatory and 
inhibitory synapses, and control various forms of synaptic plasticity in the
adult brain. The molecular machinery required for specific eCB functions during
synaptic plasticity is well established. However, eCB signaling plays
surprisingly fundamental roles in controlling the acquisition of neuronal
identity during CNS development. Recent work suggests that selective recruitment 
of regulatory signaling networks to CB1 cannabinoid receptors dictates neuronal
state-change decisions. In addition, the spatial localization and temporal
precision of eCB actions emerges as a novel organizer in developing neuronal
networks. Current challenges include fitting novel molecular candidates into
regulatory eCB signaling pathways, and defining the temporal dynamics of
context-dependent signaling mechanisms underpinning particular neuronal
specification events.

Inhibitory pathways in the neocortex display a variety of temporal and spatial
patterns, maintaining a dynamic balance with excitatory synaptic activity. Recent
studies have revealed prevalent polysynaptic subcircuits within the neocortical
microcircuitry. These subcircuits involve excitatory and inhibitory connections
that are activated by neurons both in supragranular and infragranular cortical
layers and mediated by different mechanisms. Interestingly, in these subcircuits 
inhibition is induced by discharge of pyramidal cells, and excitation is caused
by specific types of GABAergic interneurons. The different polysynaptic
subcircuits are discussed with respect to their spatial and temporal properties
and their possible functional role in cortical processing.

Action potential initiation, modulation, and duration in neurons depend on a
variety of Na+ and K+ channels that are highly enriched at the axon initial
segment (AIS). The AIS also has high densities of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs),
modulatory proteins, and a unique extracellular matrix (ECM). In contrast to
other functional domains of axons (e.g. the nodes of Ranvier and axon terminals) 
whose development depends on the interactions with different cells (e.g.
myelinating glia and postsynaptic cells), the recruitment and retention of AIS
proteins is intrinsically specified through axonal cytoskeletal and scaffolding
proteins. We speculate that the AIS has previously unappreciated forms of
plasticity that influence neuronal excitability, and that AIS plasticity is
regulated by the developmental or activity-dependent modulation of scaffolding
protein levels rather than directly altering ion channel expression.

Analog signalling in mammalian cortical axons.

In the mammalian cortex, the classic view assumes that the output information of 
a neuron is encoded in rather stereotyped action potentials, which provide an
all-or-none or digital way of communication between cell body and axonal boutons.
A role for subthreshold signal propagation within cortical axons has largely been
ignored. Recent achievements of direct recordings from axonal structures in the
hippocampus and neocortex extended the classic view by the observation that
subthreshold-graded signals propagate down the axon over distances of up to 1 mm.
At certain synapses, these analog axonal signals modulate
action-potential-dependent transmitter release, thereby enabling a hybrid code of
information transmission in local cortical circuits.

Neurons extend axonal processes over long distances, necessitating efficient
transport mechanisms to convey target-derived neurotrophic survival signals from 
remote distal axons to cell bodies. Retrograde transport, powered by dynein
motors, supplies cell bodies with survival signals in the form of 'signaling
endosomes'. In this review, we will discuss new advances in our understanding of 
the motor proteins that bind to and move signaling components in a retrograde
direction and discuss mechanisms that might specify distinct neuronal responses
to spatially restricted neurotrophin signals. Disruption of retrograde transport 
leads to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the role of
retrograde transport of signaling endosomes for axonal maintenance and the
importance of efficient transport for neuronal survival and function.

Neural cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the immunoglobulin superfamily engage in
multiple neuronal interactions that influence cell migration, axonal and
dendritic projection, and synaptic targeting. Their downstream signal
transduction events specify whether a cell moves or projects axons and dendrites 
to targets in the brain. Many of the diverse functions of CAMs are brought about 
through homophilic and heterophilic interactions with other cell surface
receptors. An emerging concept is that CAMs act as coreceptors to assist in
intracellular signal transduction, and to provide cytoskeletal linkage necessary 
for cell and growth cone motility. Here we will focus on new discoveries that
have revealed novel coreceptor functions for the best-understood CAMs--L1, CHL1, 
and NCAM--important for neuronal migration and axon guidance. We will also
discuss how dysregulation of CAMs may also bear on neuropsychiatric disease and
cancer.

Multiple signaling pathways initiate and specify the formation of synapses in the
central nervous system. General principles that organize nascent synapses have
emerged from the studies in multiple model organisms. These include the
synapse-organizing roles of dedicated synaptic adhesion molecules, synaptic
signaling following receptor-ligand interactions, and the regulation of synapse
formation by secreted molecules. Intracellularly, a range of effectors
subsequently regulates signaling steps and cytoskeletal changes. Together, a
blueprint of synapse formation is emerging into which these distinct signaling
steps will need to be integrated temporally and spatially.

Cell death plays an important role both in shaping the developing nervous system

receptors can trigger either cell death or survival and growth. Recent studies
implicate five death receptors--Fas/CD95, TNFR1 (tumor necrosis factor
receptor-1), p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor), DR4, and DR5 (death receptors-4 
and -5)--in different aspects of neural development or degeneration. Their roles 
may be neuroprotective in models of Parkinson's disease, or pro-apoptotic in ALS 
and stroke. Such different outcomes probably reflect the diversity of
transcriptional and posttranslational signaling pathways downstream of death
receptors in neurons and glia.

In the mouse olfactory system, there are approximately 1000 types of odorant
receptors (ORs), which perform multiple functions in olfactory sensory neurons
(OSNs). In addition to detecting odors, the functional OR protein ensures the
singular gene choice of the OR by negative-feedback regulation. ORs also direct
the axonal projection of OSNs both globally and locally by modulating the
transcriptional levels of axon-guidance and axon-sorting molecules. In these
latter processes, the second messenger, cAMP, plays differential roles in the
fasciculation and targeting of axons. In this review, we will discuss how ORs
differentially regulate intracellular signals for distinct functions.

Majority of the brain dopamine (DA) neurons reside in a distinct area in the
midbrain and project axons into the striatum and frontal cortex to control
central nervous system (CNS) functions such as movement, motivation and mood.
Age-associated specific loss of DA neurons particularly in the midbrain region
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) causes Parkinson disease (PD), an incurable
condition characterized by rigidity, involuntary and slowed movement affecting
about 1% of people over the age of 60 years. Dopamine neurons appear to be one of
the most sensitive types of neurons to both intrinsic and extrinsic stressors in 
the brain. Here we summarize how transcription factors, growth factors and in
particular neurotrophic factors are used to make and maintain DA neurons. We also
discuss mechanisms that underlie their specific vulnerability and highlight
current state of art in drug development.

MicroRNAs in neurodegeneration.

microRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in
diverse cellular and developmental processes. Many miRNAs are expressed
specifically in the central nervous system, where they have roles in
differentiation, neuronal survival, and potentially also in plasticity and
learning. The absence of miRNAs in a variety of specific postmitotic neurons can 
lead to progressive loss of these neurons and behavioral defects reminiscent of
the phenotypes seen in the pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we
review recent studies which provide a link between miRNA function and
neurodegeneration. We also discuss evidence which might suggest involvement of
miRNAs in the emergence or progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Although neurons within the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have a remarkable
ability to repair themselves after injury, neurons within the central nervous
system (CNS) do not spontaneously regenerate. This problem has remained
recalcitrant despite a century of research on the reaction of axons to injury.
The balance between inhibitory cues present in the environment and the intrinsic 
growth capacity of the injured neuron determines the extent of axonal
regeneration following injury. The cell body of an injured neuron must receive
accurate and timely information about the site and extent of axonal damage in
order to increase its intrinsic growth capacity and successfully regenerate. One 
of the mechanisms contributing to this process is retrograde transport of injury 
signals. For example, molecules activated at the injury site convey information
to the cell body leading to the expression of regeneration-associated genes and
increased growth capacity of the neuron. Here we discuss recent studies that have
begun to dissect the injury-signaling pathways involved in stimulating the
intrinsic growth capacity of injured neurons.

The chemokine CXCL12 (or SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 have originally been
described as regulators of cell interactions in the immune system. However, over 
the past years it has become clear that this receptor/ligand pair is an important
component of the machinery that controls cell migration in different regions of
the developing nervous system. Here we will review some of these functions of the
CXCL12/CXCR4 system, focusing on migration events in the cerebellum and the
cortex. Furthermore, we will discuss these findings in light of the recently
discovered second receptor for CXCL12, CXCR7, and the original functional
properties of this molecule that have been described in zebrafish.

The brain develops and functions in a complex ionic milieu, which is a
prerequisite for neurotransmitter function and neuronal signaling.
Neurotransmitters and ion fluxes are, however, important not only in neuronal
signaling, but also in the control of neural differentiation, and in this review,
we highlight the recent advances in our understanding of how the gamma-amino
butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter and ion fluxes are relevant for cell cycle
control and neural differentiation. Conversely, proteins previously associated
with ion transport across membranes have been endowed with novel ion-independent 
functions, and we discuss this in the context of gap junctions in cell adhesion
and of the neuron-specific K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2 in dendritic spine
development. Collectively, these findings provide a richer and more complex
picture of when ion fluxes are needed in neural development and when they are
not.

Cortico-striatal representation of time in animals and humans.

Interval timing in the seconds-to-minutes range is crucial to learning, memory,
and decision-making. Recent findings argue for the involvement of
cortico-striatal circuits that are optimized by the dopaminergic modulation of
oscillatory activity and lateral connectivity at the level of cortico-striatal
inputs. Striatal medium spiny neurons are proposed to detect the coincident
activity of specific beat patterns of cortical oscillations, thereby permitting
the discrimination of supra-second durations based upon the reoccurring patterns 
of subsecond neural firing. This proposal for the cortico-striatal representation
of time is consistent with the observed psychophysical properties of interval
timing (e.g. linear time scale and scalar variance) as well as much of the
available pharmacological, lesion, patient, electrophysiological, and
neuroimaging data from animals and humans (e.g. dopamine-related timing deficits 
in Huntington's and Parkinson's disease as well as related animal models). The
conclusion is that although the striatum serves as a 'core timer', it is part of 
a distributed timing system involving the coordination of large-scale oscillatory
networks.

The perception of events in space and time is at the root of our interactions
with the environment. The precision with which we perceive visual events in time 
enables us to act upon objects with great accuracy and the loss of such functions
due to brain lesions can be catastrophic. We outline a visual timing mechanism
that deals with the trajectory of an object's existence across time, a crucial
function when keeping track of multiple objects that temporally overlap or occur 
sequentially. Recent evidence suggests these functions are served by an extended 
network of areas, which we call the 'when' pathway. Here we show that the when
pathway is distinct from and interacts with the well-established 'where' and
'what' pathways.

Experiments in monkeys have shown that coding the goal of the motor acts is a
fundamental property of the cortical motor system. In area F5, goal-coding motor 
neurons are also activated by observing motor acts done by others (the
'classical' mirror mechanism); in area F2 and area F1, some motor neurons are
activated by the mere observation of goal-directed movements of a cursor
displayed on a computer screen (a 'mirror-like' mechanism). Experiments in humans
and monkeys have shown that the mirror mechanism enables the observer to
understand the intention behind an observed motor act, in addition to the goal of
it. Growing evidence shows that a deficit in the mirror mechanism underlies some 
aspects of autism.

Music, like language, is acquired effortlessly in early life and fulfils a
multitude of social, cultural and emotional functions. However, those with a
disorder recently termed 'congenital amusia' (CA) fail to recognise common tunes 
from their culture, do not hear when notes are 'out of tune' and sometimes report
that music sounds like a 'din' or 'banging'. The core deficit appears to be a
problem in discriminating pitch direction, a building block for the
representation of melodic contour. Familial studies suggest the disorder is
heritable and associated with structural differences in temporal and frontal
cortices. The disorder provides a window onto the neuro-cognitive architecture of
musical processing, and the possible etiologies of disordered development.

Dissociating explicit timing from temporal expectation with fMRI.

Explicit timing is engaged whenever subjects make a deliberate estimate of
discrete duration in order to compare it with a previously memorised standard.
Conversely, implicit timing is engaged, even without a specific instruction to
time, whenever sensorimotor information is temporally structured and can be used 
to predict the duration of future events. Both emergent timing (motor) and
temporal expectation (perceptual) are forms of implicit timing. Recent fMRI
studies demonstrate discrete neural substrates for explicit and implicit timing. 
Specifically, basal ganglia are activated almost invariably by explicit timing,
with co-activation of prefrontal, premotor and cerebellar areas being more
context-dependent. Conversely, implicit perceptual timing (or "temporal
expectation") recruits cortical action circuits, comprising inferior parietal and
premotor areas, highlighting its role in the optimisation of prospective
behaviour.

Anchors, scales and the relative coding of value in the brain.

People are alarmingly susceptible to manipulations that change both their
expectations and experience of the value of goods. Recent studies in behavioral
economics suggest such variability reflects more than mere caprice. People
commonly judge options and prices in relative terms, rather than absolutely, and 
display strong sensitivity to exemplar and price anchors. We propose that these
findings elucidate important principles about reward processing in the brain. In 
particular, relative valuation may be a natural consequence of adaptive coding of
neuronal firing to optimise sensitivity across large ranges of value.
Furthermore, the initial apparent arbitrariness of value may reflect the brains' 
attempts to optimally integrate diverse sources of value-relevant information in 
the face of perceived uncertainty. Recent findings in neuroscience support both
accounts, and implicate regions in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and
ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the construction of value.

The ability to share the other's feelings, known as empathy, has recently become 
the focus of social neuroscience studies. We review converging evidence that
empathy with, for example, the pain of another person, activates part of the
neural pain network of the empathizer, without first hand pain stimulation to the
empathizer's body. The amplitude of empathic brain responses is modulated by the 
intensity of the displayed emotion, the appraisal of the situation,
characteristics of the suffering person such as perceived fairness, and features 
of the empathizer such as gender or previous experience with pain-inflicting
situations. Future studies in the field should address inter-individual
differences in empathy, development and plasticity of the empathic brain over the
life span, and the link between empathy, compassionate motivation, and prosocial 
behavior.

In neurobiological studies of various cognitive abilities, neuroscientists use
mathematical models to fit behavioral data from well-controlled experiments and
look for neural activities that are correlated with parameters in those models.
The pinpointed neural correlates are often taken as evidence that a given task is
performed according to the prescription of the applied model, and the relevant
brain areas encode parameters of such a model. However, to go beyond correlations
toward causal understanding, it is necessary to elucidate at multiple levels the 
neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive processes. This review focuses on recent
studies of reward-based decision-making that have begun to tackle this challenge.

Spiking networks for Bayesian inference and choice.

Systems neuroscience traditionally conceptualizes a population of spiking neurons
as merely encoding the value of a stimulus. Yet, psychophysics has revealed that 
people take into account stimulus uncertainty when performing sensory or motor
computations and do so in a nearly Bayes-optimal way. This suggests that neural
populations do not encode just a single value but an entire probability
distribution over the stimulus. Several such probabilistic codes have been
proposed, including one that utilizes the structure of neural variability to
enable simple neural implementations of probabilistic computations such as
optimal cue integration. This approach provides a quantitative link between
Bayes-optimal behaviors and specific neural operations. It allows for novel ways 
to evaluate probabilistic codes and for predictions for physiological population 
recordings.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has quickly become the most
prominent tool in cognitive neuroscience. In this article, I outline some of the 
limits on the kinds of inferences that can be supported by fMRI, focusing
particularly on reverse inference, in which the engagement of specific mental
processes is inferred from patterns of brain activation. Although this form of
inference is weak, newly developed methods from the field of machine learning
offer the potential to formalize and strengthen reverse inferences. I conclude by
discussing the increasing presence of fMRI results in the popular media and the
ethical implications of the increasing predictive power of fMRI.

The phasic firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons has been shown to respond
both to the receipt of rewarding stimuli, and the degree to which such stimuli
are anticipated by the recipient. This has led to the hypothesis that these
neurons encode reward prediction error (RPE)-the difference between how rewarding
an event is, and how rewarding it was expected to be. However, the RPE model is
one of a number of competing explanations for dopamine activity that have proved 
hard to disentangle, mainly because they are couched in terms of latent, or
unobservable, variables. This article describes techniques for dealing with
latent variables common in economics and decision theory, and reviews work that
uses these techniques to provide simple, non-parametric tests of the RPE
hypothesis, allowing clear differentiation between competing explanations.

New insights on the subcortical representation of reward.

Reward information is represented by many subcortical areas and neuron types,
which constitute a complex network. Its output is usually mediated by the basal
ganglia where behaviors leading to rewards are disinhibited and behaviors leading
to no reward are suppressed. Midbrain dopamine neurons modulate these basal
ganglia neurons differentially using signals related to reward-prediction error. 
Recent studies suggest that other types of subcortical neurons assist, instruct, 
or work in parallel with dopamine neurons. Such reward-related neurons are found 
in the areas which have been associated with stress, pain, mood, emotion, memory,
and arousal. These results suggest that reward needs to be understood in a larger
framework of animal behavior.

Fear, faces, and the human amygdala.

Adolphs R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA. radolphs@hss.caltech.edu

The amygdala's historical role in processing stimuli related to threat and fear
is being modified to suggest a role that is broader and more abstract. Amygdala
lesions impair the ability to seek out and make use of the eye region of faces,
resulting in impaired fear perception. Other studies in rats and humans revive
earlier proposals that the amygdala is important not only for fear perception as 
such, but also for detecting saliency and biological relevance. Debates about
some features of this processing now suggest that while the amygdala can process 
fearful facial expressions in the absence of conscious perception, and while
there is some degree of preattentive processing, this depends on the context and 
is not necessarily more rapid than cortical processing routes. A large current
research effort extends the amygdala's putative role to a number of psychiatric
illnesses.

Why does a clock sometimes appear stopped? Is it possible to perceive the world
in slow motion during a car accident? Can action and effect be reversed? Time
perception is surprisingly prone to measurable distortions and illusions. The
past few years have introduced remarkable progress in identifying and quantifying
temporal illusions of duration, temporal order, and simultaneity. For example,
perceived durations can be distorted by saccades, by an oddball in a sequence, or
by stimulus complexity or magnitude. Temporal order judgments of actions and
sensations can be reversed by the exposure to delayed motor consequences, and
simultaneity judgments can be manipulated by repeated exposure to nonsimultaneous
stimuli. The confederacy of recently discovered illusions points to the
underlying neural mechanisms of time perception.

Humans live in highly complex social environments and some of our most important 
decisions are made in the context of social interactions. Research that probes
the neural basis of decision-making in the context of social interactions
combines behavioral paradigms from game theory with a variety of methods from
neuroscience. The neural correlates of decision making in reciprocal exchange and
bargaining games have been probed with functional neuroimaging, transcranial
magnetic stimulation, and pharmacological manipulations. These studies have begun
to elucidate a set of brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in
decision-making in social interactions.

Building a synapse: lessons on synaptic specificity and presynaptic assembly from
the nematode C. elegans.

Synapses are specialized sites of cell contact that mediate information flow
between neurons and their targets. Genetic screens in the nematode C. elegans
have led to the discovery of a number of molecules required for synapse
patterning and assembly. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of
guidepost cells in the positioning of presynaptic sites at specific locations
along the axon. Interestingly, these guideposts can promote or inhibit synapse
formation, and do so by utilizing transmembrane adhesion molecules or secreted
factors that act over relatively larger distances. Once the decision of where to 
build a presynaptic terminal has been made, key molecules are recruited to
assemble synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins at that site. Multiple steps 
of this process are regulated by ubiquitin ligase complexes. Interestingly, some 
of the molecules involved in presynaptic assembly also play roles in regulating
axon polarity and outgrowth, suggesting that different neurodevelopmental
processes are molecularly integrated.

Dscam-mediated repulsion controls tiling and self-avoidance.

Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

Recent studies have uncovered the molecular basis of self-avoidance and tiling,
two fundamental principles required for the formation of neural circuits. Both of
these wiring strategies are established through homophilic repulsion between
Dscam proteins expressed on opposing cell surfaces. In Drosophila, Dscam1
mediates self-avoidance, whereas Dscam2 mediates tiling. By contrast, phenotypes 
in the retina of the DSCAM mutant mouse indicate that DSCAM functions in both
self-avoidance and tiling. These findings suggest that homophilic recognition
molecules that have classically been defined as adhesive may also function as
repulsive cues and that Dscam proteins specialize in this function.

Critical period revisited: impact on vision.

Neural circuits are shaped by experience in early postnatal life. The permanent
loss of visual acuity (amblyopia) and anatomical remodeling within primary visual
cortex following monocular deprivation is a classic example of critical period
development from mouse to man. Recent work in rodents reveals a residual
subthreshold potentiation of open eye response throughout life. Resetting
excitatory-inhibitory balance or removing molecular 'brakes' on structural
plasticity may unmask the potential for recovery of function in adulthood. Novel 
pharmacological or environmental interventions now hold great therapeutic promise
based on a deeper understanding of critical period mechanisms.

Genetic regulation of arealization of the neocortex.

USA. doleary@salk.edu

Arealization of the neocortex is controlled by a regulatory hierarchy beginning
with morphogens secreted from patterning centers positioned at the perimeter of
the dorsal telencephalon. These morphogens act in part to establish within
cortical progenitors the differential expression of transcription factors that
specify their area identity, which is inherited by their neuronal progeny,
providing the genetic framework for area patterning. The two patterning centers
most directly implicated in arealization are the commissural plate, which
expresses fibroblast growth factors, and the cortical hem, which expresses bone
morphogenetic proteins and vertebrate orthologs of Drosophila wingless, the Wnts.
A third, albeit putative, patterning center is the antihem, identified by its
expression of multiple signaling molecules. We describe recent findings on roles 
for these patterning centers in arealization. We also present the most recent
evidence on functions of the four transcription factors, Emx2, COUP-TFI, Pax6,
and Sp8, thus far implicated in arealization. We also describe screens for
candidate target genes of these transcription factors, or other genes potentially
involved in arealization. We conclude with an assessment of a forward genetics
approach for identifying genes involved in determining area size based in part on
quantitative trait locus mapping, and the implications for significant
differences between individuals in area size on behavioral performance.

Transcriptional mechanisms controlling motor neuron diversity and connectivity.

Switzerland.

The control of movement relies on the precision with which motor circuits are
assembled during development. Spinal motor neurons (MNs) provide the trigger to
signal the appropriate sequence of muscle contractions and initiate movement.
This task is accommodated by the diversification of MNs into discrete
subpopulations, each of which acquires precise axonal trajectories and central
connectivity patterns. An upstream Hox factor-based regulatory network in MNs
defines their competence to deploy downstream programs including the expression
of Nkx and ETS transcription factors. These interactive transcriptional programs 
coordinate MN differentiation and connectivity, defining a sophisticated roadmap 
of motor circuit assembly in the spinal cord. Similar principles using modular
interaction of transcriptional programs to control neuronal diversification and
circuit connectivity are likely to act in other CNS circuits.

The polarization of axon and dendrites underlies the ability of neurons to
integrate and transmit information in the brain. Important progress has been made
toward the identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal
polarization using primarily in vitro approaches such as dissociated culture of
rodent hippocampal neurons. The predominant view emerging from this paradigm is
that neuronal polarization is initiated by intrinsic activation of signaling
pathways underlying the initial break in neuronal symmetry that precedes the
future asymmetric growth of the axon. Recent evidence shows that (i)
axon-dendrite polarization is specified when neurons engage migration in vivo,
(ii) that a kinase pathway defined by LKB1and SAD-kinases (Par4/Par1 dyad) is
required for proper neuronal polarization in vivo and that (iii) extracellular
cues can play an instructive role during neuronal polarization. Here, we review
some of these recent results and highlight future challenges in the field
including the determination of how extracellular cues control intracellular
responses underlying neuronal polarization in vivo.

New neurons are continuously generated in the dentate gyrus of the mammalian
hippocampus and in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles throughout
life. The origin of these new neurons is believed to be from multipotent adult
neural stem cells. Aided by new methodologies, significant progress has been made
in the characterization of neural stem cells and their development in the adult
brain. Recent studies have also begun to reveal essential extrinsic and intrinsic
molecular mechanisms that govern sequential steps of adult neurogenesis in the
hippocampus and subventricular zone/olfactory bulb, from proliferation and fate
specification of neural progenitors to maturation, navigation, and synaptic
integration of the neuronal progeny. Future identification of molecular
mechanisms and physiological functions of adult neurogenesis will provide further
insight into the plasticity and regenerative capacity of the mature central
nervous system.

The astonishing cellular diversity in the central nervous system (CNS) arises
from neural progenitors which can undergo different modes of symmetric and
asymmetric divisions to self-renew as well as produce differentiated neuronal and
glial progeny. Drosophila CNS neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, have been
utilised as a model to stimulate the understanding of the processes of asymmetric
division, generation of neuronal lineages and, more recently, stem cell biology
in vertebrates. Here we review some recent developments involving Drosophila and 
mammalian neural progenitor cells, highlighting some similarities and differences
in the mechanisms that regulate their divisions during neurogenesis.

GABA and neuroligin signaling: linking synaptic activity and adhesion in
inhibitory synapse development.

Author information:

GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition is crucial in neural circuit operations. In
mammalian brains, the development of inhibitory synapses and innervation patterns
is often a prolonged postnatal process, regulated by neural activity. Emerging
evidence indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts beyond inhibitory
transmission and regulates inhibitory synapse development. Indeed, GABA(A)
receptors not only function as chloride channels that regulate membrane voltage
and conductance but also play structural roles in synapse maturation and
stabilization. The link from GABA(A) receptors to postsynaptic and presynaptic
adhesion is probably mediated, partly by neuroligin-reurexin interactions, which 
are potent in promoting GABAergic synapse formation. Therefore, similar to
glutamate signaling at excitatory synapse, GABA signaling may coordinate
maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic sites at inhibitory synapses. Defining
the many steps from GABA signaling to receptor trafficking/stability and
neuroligin function will provide further mechanistic insights into
activity-dependent development and possibly plasticity of inhibitory synapses.

The molecular control of cell-type specification within the developing cerebellum
as well as the genetic causes of the most common human developmental cerebellar
disorders have long remained mysterious. Recent genetic lineage and
loss-of-function data from mice have revealed unique and nonoverlapping
anatomical origins for GABAergic neurons from ventricular zone precursors and
glutamatergic cell from rhombic lip precursors, mirroring distinct origins for
these neurotransmitter-specific cell types in the cerebral cortex. Mouse studies 
elucidating the role of Ptf1a as a cerebellar ventricular zone GABerigic fate
switch were actually preceded by the recognition that PTF1A mutations in humans
cause cerebellar agenesis, a birth defect of the human cerebellum. Indeed,
several genes for congenital human cerebellar malformations have recently been
identified, including genes causing Joubert syndrome, Dandy-Walker malformation, 
and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. These studies have pointed to surprisingly
complex roles for transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial function, and
neuronal cilia in patterning, homeostasis, and cell proliferation during
cerebellar development. Together, mouse and human studies are synergistically
advancing our understanding of the developmental mechanisms that generate the
uniquely complex mature cerebellum.

Though many neuronal cell fate decisions result in reproducible outcomes,
stochastic choices often lead to spatial randomization of cell subtypes. This is 
often the case in sensory systems where expression of a specific sensory receptor
gene is selected randomly from a set of possible outcomes. Here, we describe
recent findings elucidating the mechanisms controlling color photoreceptor
subtypes in flies and olfactory receptor subtypes in worms and mice. Although
well-known biological concepts such as lateral signaling and promoter selection
play roles in these cases, fundamental questions concerning these choice
mechanisms remain.

The determination of projection neuron identity in the developing cerebral
cortex.

Leone DP(1), Srinivasan K, Chen B, Alcamo E, McConnell SK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Here we review the mechanisms that determine projection neuron identity during
cortical development. Pyramidal neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex can be
classified into two major classes: corticocortical projection neurons, which are 
concentrated in the upper layers of the cortex, and subcortical projection
neurons, which are found in the deep layers. Early progenitor cells in the
ventricular zone produce deep layer neurons that express transcription factors
including Sox5, Fezf2, and Ctip2, which play important roles in the specification
of subcortically projecting axons. Upper layer neurons are produced from
progenitors in the subventricular zone, and the expression of Satb2 in these
differentiating neurons is required for the formation of axonal projections that 
connect the two cerebral hemispheres. The Fezf2/Ctip2 and Satb2 pathways appear
to be mutually repressive, thus ensuring that individual neurons adopt either a
subcortical or callosal projection neuron identity at early times during
development. The molecular mechanisms by which Satb2 regulates gene expression
involves long-term epigenetic changes in chromatin configuration, which may
enable cell fate decisions to be maintained during development.

Author information:

Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. al404@cam.ac.uk

An increasing body of evidence indicates that local axonal translation is
required for growing axons to respond appropriately to guidance cues and other
stimuli. Recent studies suggest that asymmetrical synthesis of cytoskeletal
proteins mediates growth cone turning and that local translation and retrograde
transport of transcription factors mediate neuronal survival. Axonal translation 
is regulated partly by selective axonal localization of mRNAs and by translation 
initiation factors and RNA-binding proteins. We discuss possible rationales for
local axonal translation, including distinct properties of nascent proteins,
precise localization, and axonal autonomy.

The emergence of neurites from a symmetrical cell body is an essential feature of
nervous system development. Neurites are the precursors of axons and dendrites
and are tipped by growth cones, motile structures that guide elongating axons in 
the developing nervous system. Growth cones steer the axon along a defined path
to its appropriate target in response to guidance cues. This navigation involves 
the dynamic extension and withdrawal of actin-filled finger-like protrusions
called filopodia that continuously sample their environment. Ena/VASP proteins, a
conserved family of actin-regulatory proteins, are crucial for filopodia
formation and function downstream of several guidance cues. Here we review recent
findings into Ena/VASP function in neurite initiation, axon outgrowth and
guidance.

Neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific behaviors in vertebrates.

From invertebrates to humans, males and females of a given species display
identifiable differences in behaviors, mostly but not exclusively pertaining to
sexual and social behaviors. Within a species, individuals preferentially exhibit
the set of behaviors that is typical of their sex. These behaviors include a wide
range of coordinated and genetically pre-programmed social and sexual displays
that ensure successful reproductive strategies and the survival of the species.
What are the mechanisms underlying sex-specific brain function? Although sexually
dimorphic behaviors represent the most extreme examples of behavioral variability
within a species, the basic principles underlying the sex specificity of brain
activity are largely unknown. Moreover, with few exceptions, the quest for
fundamental differences in male and female brain structures and circuits that
would parallel that of sexual behaviors and peripheral organs has so far
uncovered modest quantitative rather than the expected clear qualitative
differences. As will be detailed in this review, recent advances have directly
challenged the established notion of the unique role of steroid hormones in
organizing and activating male- and female-specific brain circuits and have
uncovered new mechanisms underlying the neural control of sex-specific behaviors.

Field potential recordings from motor cortex show oscillations in the beta-band
(approximately 20 Hz), which are coherent with similar oscillations in the
activity of contralateral contracting muscles. Recent findings have revised
concepts of how this activity might be generated in the cortex, suggesting it
could achieve useful computation. Other evidence shows that these oscillations
engage not just motor structures, but also return from muscle to the central
nervous system via feedback afferent pathways. Somatosensory cortex has strong
beta-band oscillations, which are synchronised with those in motor cortex,
allowing oscillatory sensory reafference to be interpreted in the context of the 
oscillatory motor command which produced it.

Research on the neuronal control of locomotion in leeches spans almost four
decades. Recent advances reviewed here include discoveries that: (1) interactions
between multiple hormones modulate initiation of swimming; (2) stretch receptors 
associated with longitudinal muscles interact with the central oscillator circuit
via electrical junctions; (3) intersegmental interactions, according to
theoretical analyses, must be relatively weak compared to oscillator interactions
within ganglia; and (4) multiple interacting neurons control the expression of
alternative modes of locomotion. The innovative techniques that facilitated these
advances include optical recording of membrane potential changes, simultaneous
intracellular injection of high and low molecular weight fluorescent dyes, and
detailed modeling via an input-output systems engineering approach.

In the past decade, functional neuroimaging has proved extremely useful in
mapping the human motor circuits involved in skilled hand movements. However, one
major drawback of this approach is the impossibility to determine the exact
contribution of each individual cortical area to precision grasping. Because
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) makes it possible to induce a transient
'virtual' lesion of discrete brain regions in healthy subjects, it has been
extensively used to provide direct insight into the causal role of a given area
in human motor behaviour. Recent TMS studies have allowed us to determine the
specific contribution, as well as the timing and the hemispheric lateralisation, 
of distinct parietal and frontal areas to the control of both the kinematics and 
dynamics of precision grasping. Moreover, recent researches have shown that the
same cortical network may contribute to language and number processing,
supporting the existence of tight interactions between processes involved in
cognition and actions. The aim of this paper is to offer a concise overview of
recent studies that have investigated the neural correlates of precision grasping
and the possible contribution of the motor system to higher cognitive functions
such as language and number processing.

Integrating hippocampus and striatum in decision-making.

Learning and memory and navigation literatures emphasize interactions between
multiple memory systems: a flexible, planning-based system and a rigid,
cached-value system. This has profound implications for decision-making. Recent
conceptualizations of flexible decision-making employ prospection and projection 
arising from a network involving the hippocampus. Recent recordings from rodent
hippocampus in decision-making situations have found transient forward-shifted
representations. Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection
probably occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and
dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a crucial
component of the less-flexible, incremental system. Current evidence, however,
suggests that striatum is involved in both flexible and stimulus-response
decision-making, with dorsolateral striatum involved in stimulus-response
strategies and ventral and dorsomedial striatum involved in goal-directed
strategies.

The crucial role of dopamine (DA) in movement control is illustrated by the
spectrum of motor disorders caused by either a deficiency or a hyperactivity of
dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia. The degeneration of nigrostriatal
DA neurons in Parkinson's disease causes poverty and slowness of movement. These 
symptoms are greatly improved by pharmacological DA replacement with
L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA), which however causes excessive
involuntary movements in a majority of patients. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
(abnormal involuntary movements) provides a topic of investigation at the
interface between clinical and basic neuroscience. In this article, we review
recent studies in rodent models, which have uncovered two principal alterations
at the basis of the movement disorder, namely, an abnormal pre-synaptic handling 
of exogenous L-DOPA, and a hyper-reactive post-synaptic response to DA.
Dysregulated nigrostriatal DA transmission causes secondary alterations in a
variety of non-dopaminergic transmitter systems, the manipulation of which
modulates dyskinesia through mechanisms that are presently unclear. Further
research on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia will contribute to a deeper understanding
of the functional interplay between neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the 
motor circuits of the basal ganglia.

As insects move through tortuous, unpredictable terrain, their neural system
allows them to exhibit striking adaptability and researchers must use every
technique at their disposal to unravel the underlying mechanisms. Descending
commands from brain centers that process tremendous amounts of information from
head sensors work together with local motor control altering their operation to
deal with barriers or move toward important targets. By analyzing movements in
detail with high-speed video, recording from identified neurons in thoracic
ganglia and examining activity in different brain regions, we are beginning to
understand how these remarkable animals navigate their environment. Coupled with 
new and exciting neurogenetic tools, the near future promises an exciting time
for studying the neural basis of insect movement.

Recent research suggests that the nervous system controls muscles by activating
flexible combinations of muscle synergies to produce a wide repertoire of
movements. Muscle synergies are like building blocks, defining characteristic
patterns of activation across multiple muscles that may be unique to each
individual, but perform similar functions. The identification of muscle synergies
has strong implications for the organization and structure of the nervous system,
providing a mechanism by which task-level motor intentions are translated into
detailed, low-level muscle activation patterns. Understanding the complex
interplay between neural circuits and biomechanics that give rise to muscle
synergies will be crucial to advancing our understanding of neural control
mechanisms for movement.

The skilled use of the hand for grasping and manipulation of objects is a
fundamental feature of the primate motor system. Grasping movements involve
transforming the visual information about an object into a motor command
appropriate for the coordinated activation of hand and finger muscles. The
cerebral cortex and its descending projections to the spinal cord are known to
play a crucial role for the control of grasp. Recent studies in non-human
primates have provided some striking new insights into the respective
contribution of the parietal and frontal motor cortical areas to the control of
grasp. Also, new approaches allowed investigating the coupling of grasp-related
activity in different cortical areas for the control of the descending motor
command.

Self-localization requires that information from several sensory modalities and
knowledge domains be integrated in order to identify an environment and determine
current location and heading. This integration occurs by the convergence of
highly processed sensory information onto neural systems in entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus. Entorhinal neurons combine angular and linear self-motion
information to generate an oriented metric signal that is then 'attached' to each
environment using information about landmarks and context. Neurons in hippocampus
use this signal to determine the animal's unique position within a particular
environment. Elucidating this process illuminates not only spatial processing but
also, more generally, how the brain builds knowledge representations from inputs 
carrying heterogeneous sensory and semantic content.

The olfactory system of Drosophila resembles that of vertebrates in its overall
anatomical organization, but is considerably reduced in terms of cell number,
making it an ideal model system to investigate odor processing in a brain
[Vosshall LB, Stocker RF: Molecular architecture of smell and taste in
Drosophila. Annu Rev Neurosci 2007, 30:505-533]. Recent studies have greatly
increased our knowledge about odor representation at different levels of
integration, from olfactory receptors to 'higher brain centers'. In addition,
Drosophila represents a favourite model system to study the neuronal basis of
olfactory learning and memory, and considerable progress during the last years
has been made in localizing the structures mediating olfactory learning and
memory [Davis RL: Olfactory memory formation in Drosophila: from molecular to
systems neuroscience. Annu Rev Neurosci 2005, 28:275-302; Gerber B, Tanimoto H,
Heisenberg M: An engram found? Evaluating the evidence from fruit flies. Curr

memory: single genes to complex neural circuits. Nat Rev Neurosci 2007,

Elucidation of the principal mechanism for sensory transduction, learning and
memory is a fundamental question in neurobiology. The simple nervous system
composed of only 302 neurons and the description of neural wiring combined with
developed imaging techniques facilitate cellular and circuit level analysis of
behavior in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Recent comprehensive analysis of
worm thermotaxis, an experience-modulated behavior, has begun to reveal
molecular, cellular, and neural circuit basis of thermosensation and neural
plasticity.

According to a widely held concept, the formation of long-term memories relies on
a reactivation and redistribution of newly acquired memory representations from
temporary storage to neuronal networks supporting long-term storage. Here, we
review evidence showing that this process of system consolidation takes place
preferentially during sleep as an 'off-line' period during which memories are
spontaneously reactivated and redistributed in the absence of interfering
external inputs. Moreover, postlearning sleep leads to a reorganization of
neuronal representations and qualitative changes of memory content. We propose
that memory reactivations during sleep are accompanied by a transient
destabilization of memory traces. Unlike wake reactivations that form part of an 
updating of memories with respect to current perceptual input, reactivations
during sleep allow for gradually adapting newly acquired memories to pre-existing
long-term memories whereby invariants and certain other features of these
memories become extracted.

Abnormal oscillatory synchronisation in the motor system leads to impaired

Neurology, London WC1N 3BG, UK. p.brown@ion.ucl.ac.uk

Converging data suggest that abnormal synchronised oscillatory activity in the
basal ganglia may contribute to bradykinesia in patients with Parkinson's
disease. This synchrony preferentially occurs over 10-30 Hz, the so-called beta
band. Correlative evidence has been supplemented by experiments in which direct
stimulation of the basal ganglia in the beta band slows movement. Yet questions
remain regarding the small scale of the latter effects and whether synchrony is
an early or even obligatory feature of parkinsonism. Nevertheless, the principle 
that abnormally synchronised activity in the beta band can disrupt the function
finds a precedent in the syndrome of cortical myoclonus. Here, pathologically
synchronised discharges of pyramidal neurons are transmitted to the healthy
spinal cord. The result is the synchronous discharge of motor units leading to
rhythmic jerking.

Large, chronically implanted arrays of microelectrodes are an increasingly common
tool for recording from primate cortex and can provide extracellular recordings
from many (order of 100) neurons. While the desire for cortically based motor
prostheses has helped drive their development, such arrays also offer great
potential to advance basic neuroscience research. Here we discuss the utility of 
array recording for the study of neural dynamics. Neural activity often has
dynamics beyond that driven directly by the stimulus. While governed by those
dynamics, neural responses may nevertheless unfold differently for nominally
identical trials, rendering many traditional analysis methods ineffective. We
review recent studies - some employing simultaneous recording, some not -
indicating that such variability is indeed present both during movement
generation and during the preceding premotor computations. In such cases,
large-scale simultaneous recordings have the potential to provide an
unprecedented view of neural dynamics at the level of single trials. However,
this enterprise will depend not only on techniques for simultaneous recording but
also on the use and further development of analysis techniques that can
appropriately reduce the dimensionality of the data, and allow visualization of
single-trial neural behavior.

Functional imaging with MRI contrast agents is an emerging experimental approach 
that can combine the specificity of cellular neural recording techniques with
noninvasive whole-brain coverage. A variety of contrast agents sensitive to
aspects of brain activity have recently been introduced. These include new probes
for calcium and other metal ions that offer high sensitivity and membrane
permeability, as well as imaging agents for high-resolution pH and metabolic
mapping in living animals. Genetically encoded MRI contrast agents have also been
described. Several of the new probes have been validated in the brain; in vivo
use of other agents remains a challenge. This review outlines advantages and
disadvantages of specific molecular imaging approaches and discusses current or
potential applications in neurobiology.

For understanding normal and pathological circuit function, capitalizing on the
full potential of recent advances in fast optical neural circuit control will
depend crucially on fast, intact-circuit readout technology. First,
millisecond-scale optical control will be best leveraged with simultaneous
millisecond-scale optical imaging. Second, both fast circuit control and imaging 
should be adaptable to intact-circuit preparations from normal and diseased
subjects. Here we illustrate integration of fast optical circuit control and fast
circuit imaging, review recent work demonstrating utility of applying fast
imaging to quantifying activity flow in disease models, and discuss integration
of diverse optogenetic and chemical genetic tools that have been developed to
precisely control the activity of genetically specified neural populations.
Together these neuroengineering advances raise the exciting prospect of
determining the role-specific cell types play in modulating neural activity flow 
in neuropsychiatric disease.

To understand how a brain processes information, we must understand the structure
of its neural circuits-especially circuit interconnection topologies and the cell
and synapse molecular architectures that determine circuit-signaling dynamics.
Our information on these key aspects of neural circuit structure has remained
incomplete and fragmentary, however, because of limitations of the best available
imaging methods. Now, new transgenic tool mice and new image acquisition tools
appear poised to permit very significant advances in our abilities to reconstruct
circuit connection topologies and molecular architectures.

The role of mu opioid receptor desensitization and endocytosis in morphine
tolerance and dependence.

Following activation, most G protein coupled receptors undergo regulation by a
cascade of events that promote receptor desensitization and endocytosis.
Following endocytosis, receptors can then be recycled to the plasma membrane,
retained in an intracellular compartment, or targeted for degradation. For
receptors that are recycled, like the mu opioid receptor (MOR), endocytosis
serves as the first step toward resensitizing receptors. For receptors that are
degraded, endocytosis serves as the first step toward receptor downregulation.
Thus, for receptors like the MOR, the desensitization-endocytosis-resensitization
cycle serves as a rapid and dynamic means to titrate signaling through the
receptor. However, not all agonist ligands at the MOR promote the same degree of 
receptor desensitization and endocytosis. For example, the endogenous peptide
ligands at the MOR induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis, and recycling. By
contrast, morphine induces only weak or partial desensitization and little to no 
endocytosis. As a consequence, signal transduction promoted by morphine is less
dynamic than that induced by endogenous ligands as well as other opioid agonists 
that promote endocytosis. The resulting imbalance of
desensitization-endocytosis-resensitization has at least two consequences: (1) in
cell types where morphine induces desensitization but not endocytosis and/or
resensitization, desensitization is protracted; (2) in cell types where morphine 
induces neither desensitization nor endocytosis, prolonged signaling through the 
receptor leads to multiple cellular adaptations downstream of receptor-G protein 
coupling. Both protracted desensitization and adaptive cellular changes probably 
contribute to the pronounced in vivo tolerance and dependence that occur with
chronic morphine treatment. As a consequence, facilitating receptor endocytosis, 
using either genetic or pharmacological approaches, can restore the balance of
signaling through the receptor and affect the development of tolerance and
dependence.

Inducible and reversible perturbation of the activity of selected neurons in vivo
is critical to understanding the dynamics of brain circuits. Several genetically 
encoded systems for rapid inducible neuronal silencing have been developed in the
past few years offering an arsenal of tools for in vivo experiments. Some systems
are based on ion-channels or pumps, others on G protein coupled receptors, and
yet others on modified presynaptic proteins. Inducers range from light to small
molecules to peptides. This diversity results in differences in the various
parameters that may determine the applicability of each tool to a particular
biological question. Although further development would be beneficial, the
current silencing tool kit already provides the ability to make specific
perturbations of circuit function in behaving animals.

Genetically encoded sensors of neural activity enable visualization of
circuit-level function in the central nervous system. Although our understanding 
of the molecular events that regulate neuronal firing, synaptic function, and
plasticity has expanded rapidly over the past 15 years, an appreciation for how
cellular changes are functionally integrated at the circuit level has lagged. A
new generation of tools that employ fluorescent sensors of neural activity
promises unique opportunities to bridge the gap between cellular level and system
level analysis. This review will focus on genetically encoded sensors. A primary 
advantage of these indicators is that they can be nonselectively introduced to
large populations of cells using either transgenic-mediated or viral-mediated
approaches. This ability removes the nontrivial obstacles of how to get chemical 
indicators into cells of interest, a problem that has dogged investigators who
have been interested in mapping neural function in the intact CNS. Five different
types of approaches and their relative utility will be reviewed here: first,
reporters of immediate-early gene (IEG) activation using promoters such as c-fos 
and arc; second, voltage-based sensors, such as GFP-coupled Na+ and K+ channels; 
third, Cl*-based sensors; fourth, Ca2+-based sensors, such as Camgaroo and the
troponin-based TN-L15; and fifth, pH-based sensors, which have been particularly 
useful for examining synaptic activity of highly convergent afferents in sensory 
systems in vivo. Particular attention will be paid to reporters of IEG
expression, because these tools employ the built-in threshold function that
occurs with activation of gene expression, provoking new experimental questions
by expanding the timescale of analysis for circuit-level and system-level
functional mapping.

Methods for the selective and reproducible expression of genetically encoded
tools in targeted subsets of cells are required to facilitate studies of neuronal
development, connectivity, and function in living animals. In the absence of
techniques for synthesizing promoters that target defined cell groups, current
methods exploit the regulatory elements of endogenous genes to achieve
specificity of transgene expression. However, single promoters often have
expression patterns too broad to pinpoint the functional roles of specific
neurons. In this review, we describe emerging combinatorial techniques that make 
transgene expression contingent not upon a single promoter, but upon two or more 
promoters. Although only a few such techniques are currently available, recent
developments promise rapid growth in this area in the coming years.

There is now conclusive evidence for widespread ongoing structural plasticity of 
presynaptic boutons and axon side-branches in the adult brain. The plasticity
complements that of postsynaptic spines, but axonal plasticity samples larger
volumes of neuropil, and has a larger impact on circuit remodeling. Axons from
distinct neurons exhibit unique ratios of stable (t1/2>9 months) and dynamic
(t1/2 5-20 days) boutons, which persist as spatially intermingled subgroups along
terminal arbors. In addition, phases of side-branch dynamics mediate larger scale
remodeling guided by synaptogenesis. The plasticity is most pronounced during
critical periods; its patterns and outcome are controlled by Hebbian mechanisms
and intrinsic neuronal factors. Novel experience, skill learning, life-style, and
age can persistently modify local circuit structure through axonal structural
plasticity.

TDP-43: a novel neurodegenerative proteinopathy.

Over the past decade, it has become clear that there is a significant overlap in 
the clinical spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS). The identification of TDP-43 as the major disease
protein in the pathology of both frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin
inclusions and ALS provides the first molecular link for these diseases.
Pathological TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to
generate carboxy-terminal fragments in affected brain regions. The normal nuclear
expression of TDP-43 is also reduced leading to the hypothesis that sequestration
of TDP-43 in pathological inclusions contributes to disease pathogenesis. Thus,
TDP-43 is the newest member of the growing list of neurodegenerative
proteinopathies, but unique in that it lacks features of brain amyloidosis.

In the mouse olfactory epithelium, there are about ten million olfactory sensory 
neurons, each expressing a single type of odorant receptor out of approximately
1000. Olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge
their axons to a specific set of glomeruli on the olfactory bulb. How odorant
receptors play an instructive role in the projection of axons to the olfactory
bulb has been one of the major issues of developmental neurobiology. Recent
studies revealed previously overlooked roles of odorant receptor-derived cAMP
signals in the axonal projection of olfactory sensory neurons; the levels of cAMP
and neuronal activity appear to determine the expression levels of axon
guidance/sorting molecules and thereby direct the axonal projection of olfactory 
sensory neurons. These findings provide new insights as to how peripheral inputs 
instruct neuronal circuit formation in the mammalian brain.

Dendrites exhibit unique cell type-specific branching patterns and targeting
specificity that are crucially important for neuronal function and connectivity. 
Recent evidence indicates that highly complex transcriptional regulatory networks
dictate various aspects of dendritic outgrowth, branching, and routing. In
addition to other intrinsic molecular pathways such as membrane protein
trafficking, interactions between neighboring dendritic branches also contribute 
to the final specification of dendritic morphology. Nonredundant coverage by
dendrites of same type of neurons, known as tiling, requires the actions of the
Tricornered/Furry (Sax-1/Sax-2) signaling pathway. However, the dendrites of a
neuron do not crossover each other, a process called self-avoidance that is
mediated by Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam). Those exciting
findings have enhanced significantly our understanding of dendritic morphogenesis
and revealed the magnitude of complexity in the underlying molecular regulatory
networks.

Cells exhibit an amazingly wide range of different forms, and in most cases the
shape of a cell is crucial for performing its specific function(s). But how does 
a cell obtain its particular shape during development, how can the shape be
adapted to different environmental conditions, and what are the consequences if
morphogenesis is impaired? An ideal cell type to study these questions is the
photoreceptor cell, a photosensitive cell present in most metazoa, highly
specialised to transform the energy from the light into a visual response. In the
last few years, studies in the Drosophila eye have led to a considerable increase
in understanding of the genetic control of photoreceptor morphogenesis; lessons, 
which may apply to other cell types as well. Most of the genes involved have been
conserved during evolution, and mutations in several of them result in retinal
degeneration, both in flies and humans. This makes the fly eye an attractive
model to unravel the genetic, molecular and cell biological basis of the
mechanisms that prevent retinal dystrophies.

During nervous system development, oligodendroglia in the central nervous system 
(CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) synthesise large
amounts of specific proteins and lipids to generate myelin, a specialised
membrane that spirally ensheathes axons and facilitates fast conduction of the
action potential. Myelination is initiated after glial processes have attached to
the axon and polarisation of the plasma membrane has been triggered. Myelin
assembly is a multi-step process that occurs in spatially distinct regions of the
cell. We propose that assembly of myelin proteins and lipids starts during their 
transport through the biosynthetic pathway and continues at the plasma membrane
aided by myelin-basic protein (MBP). These sequential processes create the
special lipid and protein composition necessary for myelin to perform its
insulating function during nerve conduction.

Research on the functional anatomy of visual cortical circuits has recently
zoomed in from the macroscopic level to the microscopic. High-resolution
functional imaging has revealed that the functional architecture of orientation
maps in higher mammals is built with single-cell precision. By contrast,
orientation selectivity in rodents is dispersed on visual cortex in a
salt-and-pepper fashion, despite highly tuned visual responses. Recent studies of
synaptic physiology indicate that there are disjoint subnetworks of
interconnected cells in the rodent visual cortex. These intermingled subnetworks,
described in vitro, may relate to the intermingled ensembles of cells tuned to
different orientations, described in vivo. This hypothesis may soon be tested
with new anatomic techniques that promise to reveal the detailed wiring diagram
of cortical circuits.

Sensory adaptation.

Adaptation occurs in a variety of forms in all sensory systems, motivating the
question: what is its purpose? A productive approach has been to hypothesize that
adaptation helps neural systems to efficiently encode stimuli whose statistics
vary in time. To encode efficiently, a neural system must change its coding
strategy, or computation, as the distribution of stimuli changes. Information
theoretic methods allow this efficient coding hypothesis to be tested
quantitatively. Empirically, adaptive processes occur over a wide range of
timescales. On short timescales, underlying mechanisms include the contribution
of intrinsic nonlinearities. Over longer timescales, adaptation is often
power-law-like, implying the coexistence of multiple timescales in a single
adaptive process. Models demonstrate that this can result from mechanisms within 
a single neuron.

Some fifty years after the first physiological studies of auditory attention, the
field is now ripening, with exciting recent insights into the psychophysics,
psychology, and neural basis of auditory attention. Current research seeks to
unravel the complex interactions of pre-attentive and attentive processing of the
acoustic scene, the role of auditory attention in mediating receptive-field
plasticity in both auditory spatial and auditory feature processing, the
contrasts and parallels between auditory and visual attention pathways and
mechanisms, the interplay of bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms, the
influential role of attention, goals, and expectations in shaping auditory
processing, and the orchestration of diverse attentional effects at multiple
levels from the cochlea to the cortex.

Sensory experience and auditory cortex plasticity are intimately related. This
relationship is most striking during infancy when changes in sensory input can
have profound effects on the functional organization of the developing cortex.
But a considerable degree of plasticity is retained throughout life, as
demonstrated by the cortical reorganization that follows damage to the sensory
periphery or by the more controversial changes in response properties that are
thought to accompany perceptual learning. Recent studies in the auditory system
have revealed the remarkably adaptive nature of sensory processing and provided
important insights into the way in which cortical circuits are shaped by
experience and learning.

Understanding how the brain performs computations requires understanding neuronal
firing patterns at successive levels of processing-a daunting and seemingly
intractable task. Two recent studies have made dramatic progress on this problem 
by showing how its dimensionality can be reduced. Using the retina as a model
system, they demonstrated that multineuronal firing patterns can be predicted by 
pairwise interactions.

Temporal expectations are continuously formed and updated, and interact with
expectations about other relevant attributes of events, in order to optimise our 
interaction with unfolding sensory stimulation. In this paper, we will highlight

modulating perception and action, and reflect on the current state of
understanding about their underlying neural systems and mechanisms.

The traditional distinction that the mammalian main olfactory system recognizes
general odor molecules and the accessory (vomeronasal) system detects pheromones 
is no longer valid. The emerging picture is that both systems have considerable
overlap in terms of the chemosignals they detect and the effects that they
mediate. Recent investigations have discovered large families of pheromonal
signals together with a rich variety of specific receptor systems and nasal
detection pathways. Selective genetic targeting of these subsystems should help
to unravel their biological role in pheromone-mediated behavioral responses.

The remarkable sensitivity, frequency selectivity, and nonlinearity of the
cochlea have been attributed to the putative 'cochlear amplifier', which consumes
metabolic energy to amplify the cochlear mechanical response to sounds. Recent
studies have demonstrated that outer hair cells actively generate force using
somatic electromotility and active hair-bundle motion. However, the expected
power gain of the cochlear amplifier has not been demonstrated experimentally,
and the measured location of cochlear nonlinearity is inconsistent with the
predicted location of the cochlear amplifier. We instead propose a 'cochlear
transformer' mechanism to interpret cochlear performance.

The lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar are examples of two different types
of relay: the former is a first order relay, transmitting information from a
subcortical source (retina), while the latter is mostly a higher order relay,
transmitting information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another cortical
area. First and higher order thalamic relays can also be recognized for much of
the rest of thalamus, and most of thalamus seems to be comprised of higher order 
relays. Higher order relays seem especially important to general corticocortical 
communication, and this challenges and extends the conventional view that such
communication is based on direct corticocortical connections.

Six highly temperature-sensitive ion channels of the transient receptor potential

channels, expressed in sensory neurons innervating the skin or the skin itself,
are active at specific temperatures ranging from noxious cold to burning heat. In
addition to temperature sensation thermoTRPs are the receptors of a growing
number of environmental chemicals (chemesthesis). Recent studies have provided
some striking new insights into the molecular mechanism of thermal and chemical
activation of these biological thermometers.

Research on the visual system focuses on using electrophysiology, pharmacology
and other invasive tools in animal models. Non-invasive tools such as scalp
electroencephalography and imaging allow examining humans but show a much lower
spatial and/or temporal resolution. Under special clinical conditions, it is
possible to monitor single-unit activity in humans when invasive procedures are
required due to particular pathological conditions including epilepsy and
Parkinson's disease. We review our knowledge about the visual system and visual
memories in the human brain at the single neuron level. The properties of the
human brain seem to be broadly compatible with the knowledge derived from animal 
models. The possibility of examining high-resolution brain activity in conscious 
human subjects allows investigators to ask novel questions that are challenging
to address in animal models.

Neural networks of the rodent barrel cortex are particularly tractable for
developing a quantitative understanding of response transformations in a cortical
column. A column in barrel cortex consists of approximately 10 compartments. Two 
thalamic input pathways, a sensory lemniscal one and sensorimotor paralemniscal
one, are transformed to approximately 7 population outputs, each with distinct
spatiotemporal response characteristics. Granular and supragranular layers are
sites of segregated processing in lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways, whereas
infragranular layers are sites of intracolumnar, lemniscal/paralemniscal
integration. Individual thalamocortical connections are relatively weak, and a
considerable fraction of thalamocortical afferents contributes to each sensory
response. Intracortically, relatively few but strong synaptic connections
contribute to sensory responses, and responses are rapidly terminated by
inhibition. Overall cortical population activity is very low. Whiskers mediate a 
wide range of behaviors and many natural tactile behaviors occur very rapidly.
Vibrissal object recognition can be size invariant and motion invariant and is
based on the tactile 'Gestaltwahrnehmung' of shape.

Sensory systems extract behaviorally relevant information from a continuous
stream of complex high-dimensional input signals. Understanding the detailed
dynamics and precise neural code, even of a single neuron, is therefore a
non-trivial task. Automated closed-loop approaches that integrate data analysis
in the experimental design ease the investigation of sensory systems in three
directions: First, adaptive sampling speeds up the data acquisition and thus
increases the yield of an experiment. Second, model-driven stimulus exploration
improves the quality of experimental data needed to discriminate between
alternative hypotheses. Third, information-theoretic data analyses open up novel 
ways to search for those stimuli that are most efficient in driving a given
neuron in terms of its firing rate or coding quality. Examples from different
sensory systems show that, in all three directions, substantial progress can be
achieved once rapid online data analysis, adaptive sampling, and computational
modeling are tightly integrated into experiments.

Neurotransmitters are rapidly removed from the extracellular space primarily
through the actions of plasma membrane transporters. This uptake process is not
only essential in the termination of neurotransmission but also serves to
replenish intracellular levels of transmitter for further release.
Neurotransmitter transporters couple the inward movement of substrate to the
movement of Na(+) down a concentration gradient and, in addition to their
transport function, some carriers also display channel-like activities. Five
Na(+)/K(+)-dependent glutamate transporter subtypes belong to the solute carrier 
1 (SLC1) family and a second family, SLC6, encompasses the Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent 
transporters for dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), noradrenaline, GABA
and glycine. Recent advances, including high-resolution structures from both
families, are now providing new insights into the molecular determinants that
contribute to substrate translocation and ion channel activities. Other
influential studies have explored how cellular regulatory mechanisms modulate
transporter function, and how the different functions of the carrier shape the
patterns of neurotransmitter signaling. This review focuses on recent studies of 
glutamate and monoamine transporters as prototypes of the two carrier families.

Mutations in PARKIN, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and DJ-1 are found in
autosomal recessive forms and some sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease. Recent 
work on these genes underscores the central importance of mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. In particular, pink1 and
parkin loss-of-function mutants in Drosophila show similar phenotypes, and pink1 
acts upstream of parkin in a common genetic pathway to regulate mitochondrial
function. DJ-1 has a role in oxidative stress protection, but a direct role of
DJ-1 in mitochondrial function has not been fully established. Importantly,
defects in mitochondrial function have also been identified in patients who carry
both PINK1 and PARKIN mutations, and in those who have sporadic Parkinson's
disease. Future studies of the biochemical interactions between Pink1 and Parkin,
and identification of other components in this pathway, are likely to provide
insight into Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and might identify new therapeutic
targets.

Glutamate and GABA are the main transmitters in the central nervous system and
their effects are mediated by ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Immunogold
electron microscopy has revealed the quantitative localization of these receptors
at 20-30nm resolution. SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling (SDS-FRL), a
newly developed immunogold method, provides an accurate estimate of molecule
numbers. Here, we summarize the recent advances in quantitative receptor
localization, including use of SDS-FRL analyses to determine numbers of AMPA-type
glutamate receptors in the cerebellum. The two-dimensional view and high
sensitivity of SDS-FRL have revealed small, irregularly shaped AMPA receptor
clusters within cerebellar synapses.

The relay of extracellular signals into changes in cellular physiology involves a
Byzantine array of intracellular signaling pathways, of which cytoplasmic protein
kinases are a crucial component. In the nervous system, a great deal of effort
has focused on understanding the conversion of patterns of synaptic activity into
long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy that are thought to underlie memory.
The goal is both to understand synaptic plasticity mechanisms, such as long-term 
potentiation, at a molecular level and to understand the relationship of these
synaptic mechanisms to behavioral memory. Although both involve the activation of
multiple signaling pathways, recent studies are beginning to define discrete
roles and mechanisms for individual kinases in the different temporal phases of
both synaptic and behavioral plasticity.

Do thin spines learn to be mushroom spines that remember?

Texas, Austin, TX 78712-0805, USA.

Dendritic spines are the primary site of excitatory input on most principal
neurons. Long-lasting changes in synaptic activity are accompanied by alterations
in spine shape, size and number. The responsiveness of thin spines to increases
and decreases in synaptic activity has led to the suggestion that they are
'learning spines', whereas the stability of mushroom spines suggests that they
are 'memory spines'. Synaptic enhancement leads to an enlargement of thin spines 
into mushroom spines and the mobilization of subcellular resources to potentiated
synapses. Thin spines also concentrate biochemical signals such as Ca(2+),
providing the synaptic specificity required for learning. Determining the
mechanisms that regulate spine morphology is essential for understanding the
cellular changes that underlie learning and memory.

Information transfer within neuronal networks requires the precise coordination
of distinct neuronal populations within a given circuit. Evidence from a variety 
of central pathways indicates that such coordination is mediated in part by the
ability of neurons to differentially regulate release properties at functionally 
divergent presynaptic elements along their individual axons according to the
identity of the postsynaptic cell being innervated. Recent findings have revealed
the cellular mechanisms by which central afferents modify release properties at
individual presynaptic sites independent of neighboring terminals. Such autonomy 
of presynaptic regulation enables target-cell-dependent short-term and long-term 
synaptic plasticity and ensures that distinct features of afferent activity are
relayed to divergent target-cell populations.

The mechanisms that determine why neurogenesis is restricted to few regions of
the adult brain in mammals, in contrast to its more widespread nature in other
vertebrates such as zebrafish, remain to be fully understood. The local
environment must provide key signals that instruct stem cell and neurogenic fate,
because non-neurogenic progenitors can be instructed towards neurogenesis in this
environment. Here, we discuss the recent progress in understanding key factors in
the local stem cell niche of the adult mammalian brain, including surprising
sources of new signals such as endothelial cells, complement factors and
microglia. Moreover, new insights have been gained into how neuronal diversity is
instructed in adult neurogenesis, prompting a new view of stem and progenitor
cell heterogeneity in the adult mammalian brain.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors mediate the majority of fast excitatory
transmission in the central nervous system. The trafficking of AMPA receptors to 
and from synapses alters synaptic strength and has been recognized as a central
mechanism underlying various forms of synaptic plasticity. Both secretory and
endocytic trafficking events seem to be driven by the subunit composition of AMPA
receptor tetramers. Moreover, recent work suggests that synapses employ different
tetramer combinations in response to altered synaptic input, suggesting the
existence of signalling pathways that mediate remodelling of AMPA receptors.
These latest developments and recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms that 
underlie channel assembly and trafficking are the subject of this review.

USA.

Repetitive nerve activity induces various forms of short-term synaptic plasticity
that have important computational roles in neuronal networks. Several forms of
short-term plasticity are caused largely by changes in transmitter release, but
the mechanisms that underlie these changes in the release process have been
difficult to address. Recent studies of a giant synapse - the calyx of Held -
have shed new light on this issue. Recordings of Ca(2+) currents or Ca(2+)
concentrations at nerve terminals reveal that regulation of presynaptic Ca(2+)
channels has a significant role in three important forms of short-term
plasticity: short-term depression, facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation.

Synaptic homeostasis provides a means for neurons and circuits to maintain stable
function in the face of perturbations such as developmental or activity-dependent
changes in synapse number or strength. These forms of plasticity are thought to
utilize negative feedback signaling to sense some aspect of activity, compare
this with an internal set point, and then adjust synaptic properties to keep
activity close to this set point. However, the molecular identity of these
signaling components has not been firmly established. Recent work suggests that
there are likely to be multiple forms of synaptic homeostasis, mediated by
distinct signaling pathways and with distinct expression mechanisms. These
include presynaptic forms that depend on retrograde signaling to presynaptic
Ca(2+) channels, and postsynaptic forms influenced by BDNF, TNFalpha and Arc
signaling. Current challenges include matching signaling elements to their
functions (i.e. as detectors of activity, as part of the set-point mechanism
and/or as effectors of synaptic change), and fitting these molecular candidates
into a unified view of the signaling pathways that underlie synaptic homeostasis.

Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Recent studies have revealed that Ca(2+) signals evoked by action potentials or
by synaptic activity within individual dendritic spines are regulated at multiple
levels. Ca(2+) influx through glutamate receptors and voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)
channels located on spines depends on the channel subunit composition, the
activity of kinases and phosphatases, the local membrane potential and past
patterns of activity. Furthermore, sources of spine Ca(2+) interact nonlinearly
such that activation of one Ca(2+) channel can enhance or depress the activity of
others. These studies have revealed that each spine is a complex and partitioned 
Ca(2+) signaling domain capable of autonomously regulating the electrical and
biochemical consequences of synaptic activity.

Do different endocytic pathways make different synaptic vesicles?

Francisco, CA 94158-2517, USA.

At a wide range of synapses, synaptic vesicles reside in distinct pools that
respond to different stimuli. The recycling pool supplies the vesicles required
for release in response to modest stimulation, whereas the reserve pool is
mobilized only by strong stimulation. Multiple pathways have been proposed for
the recycling of synaptic vesicles after exocytosis, but the relationship of
these pathways to the different synaptic vesicle pools has remained unclear.
Synaptic vesicle proteins have also been assumed to undergo recycling as a unit. 
However, emerging data indicate that differences in the association with distinct
endocytic adaptors such as the heterotetrameric adaptor AP3 influence the
trafficking of individual synaptic vesicle proteins, affecting the composition of
synaptic vesicles and hence their functional characteristics. These observations 
might begin to account for differences in the properties of different vesicle
pools.

GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for GABA, the main
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. They are
implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. With the
cloning of GABA(B) receptors ten years ago, substantial progress was made in our 
understanding of this receptor system. Here, we review current concepts of
synaptic GABA(B) functions and present the evidence that points to specific roles
for receptor subtypes. We discuss ultrastructural studies revealing that most
GABA(B) receptors are located remote from GABAergic terminals, which raises
questions as to when such receptors become activated. Finally, we provide
possible explanations for the perplexing situation that GABA(B) receptor subtypes
that have indistinguishable properties in vitro generate distinct GABA(B)
responses in vivo.

The growing realization that neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), are crucial in modulating synaptic plasticity has broadened the
spectrum of their trophic actions. At the same time, it has become clear that
Abeta peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) have dramatic effects
on synaptic transmission before the onset of the neurodegenerative disease.
Because neurotrophins and Abeta are responsible for affecting both synaptic and
cognitive function, it is likely that their mechanisms of action will be related 
and might even intersect. This review highlights several recent findings that
suggest trophic factors and APP use similar pathways to control neuronal
activity.

Ca(2+)-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release: mechanisms that

Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) serve as retrograde messengers at
synapses in various regions of the brain. They are released from postsynaptic
neurons and cause transient and long-lasting reduction of neurotransmitter
release through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoid 
release is induced either by increased postsynaptic Ca(2+) levels or by
activation of G(q/11)-coupled receptors. When these two stimuli coincide,
endocannabinoid release is markedly enhanced, which is attributed to the Ca(2+)
dependency of phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta). This Ca(2+)-assisted receptor-driven
endocannabinoid release is suggested to participate in various forms of synaptic 
plasticity, including short-term associative plasticity in the cerebellum and
spike-timing-dependent long-term depression in the somatosensory cortex. In these
forms of plasticity, PLCbeta seems to function as a coincident detector of
presynaptic and postsynaptic activities.

Glutamate mediates most of the excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian
central nervous system by activating ionotropic glutamate receptors. Structural
and functional studies of ionotropic glutamate receptors have offered detailed
insight into the mechanism by which these integral membrane proteins function. In
particular, advances in our understanding of the atomic structure of the
agonist-binding domain have provided new opportunities to consider the
conformational changes that take place in a functioning ligand-gated ion channel.
Several recent studies have turned up important new ideas about the structural
determinants of channel activation, deactivation and desensitization of AMPA
receptors. Working hypotheses derived from this structural insight offer a rare
opportunity to enrich and guide functional studies.

Much debate has been stimulated by the recent hypothesis that human language
consists of a faculty that is shared with non-human animals (faculty of language 
in a broad sense; FLB) and a faculty that is specific to human language (faculty 
of language in a narrow sense; FLN). This hypothesis has encouraged a tendency to
emphasize one component of FLN: the cognitive operation of recursion. In
consequence, non-syntactical, yet unique, aspects of human language have been
neglected. One of these properties consists of vocal learning that enables an
abundance of learned syllables. I suggest that FLN is not an independent faculty,
but an 'emergent' property, arising from interactions between several other
non-syntactical subfaculties of FLB, including vocal learning ability.

Adolescence is a critical period for maturation of neurobiological processes that
underlie higher cognitive functions and social and emotional behavior. Recent
studies have applied new advances in magnetic resonance imaging to increase
understanding of the neurobiological changes that occur during the transition
from childhood to early adulthood. Structural imaging data indicate progressive
and regressive changes in the relative volumes of specific brain regions,
although total brain volume is not significantly altered. The prefrontal cortex
matures later than other regions and its development is paralleled by increased
abilities in abstract reasoning, attentional shifting, response inhibition and
processing speed. Changes in emotional capacity, including improvements in
affective modulation and discrimination of emotional cues, are also seen during
adolescence. Functional imaging studies using cognitive and affective challenges 
have shown that frontal cortical networks undergo developmental changes in
processing. In summary, brain regions that underlie attention, reward evaluation,
affective discrimination, response inhibition and goal-directed behavior undergo 
structural and functional re-organization throughout late childhood and early
adulthood. Evidence from recent imaging studies supports a model by which the
frontal cortex adopts an increasingly regulatory role. These neurobiological
changes are believed to contribute, in part, to the range in cognitive and
affective behavior seen during adolescence.

The discovery of theta-rhythm-dependent firing of rodent hippocampal neurons
highlighted the functional significance of temporal encoding in hippocampal
memory. However, earlier theoretical studies on this topic seem divergent and
experimental implications are invariably complicated. To obtain a unified
understanding of neural dynamics in the hippocampal memory, we here review recent
developments in computational models and experimental discoveries on the
'theta-phase precession' of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells. We
identify a theoretical hypothesis that is well supported by experimental facts;
this model reveals a significant contribution of theta-phase coding to the
on-line real-time operation of episodic events, through highly parallel
representation of spatiotemporal information.

Attention and memory cannot operate without each other. In this review, we
discuss two lines of recent evidence that support this interdependence. First,
memory has a limited capacity, and thus attention determines what will be
encoded. Division of attention during encoding prevents the formation of
conscious memories, although the role of attention in formation of unconscious
memories is more complex. Such memories can be encoded even when there is another
concurrent task, but the stimuli that are to be encoded must be selected from
among other competing stimuli. Second, memory from past experience guides what
should be attended. Brain areas that are important for memory, such as the
hippocampus and medial temporal lobe structures, are recruited in attention
tasks, and memory directly affects frontal-parietal networks involved in spatial 
orienting. Thus, exploring the interactions between attention and memory can
provide new insights into these fundamental topics of cognitive neuroscience.

Recent studies show that anatomical and functional brain networks exhibit similar
small-world properties. However, the networks that are compared often differ in
what the nodes represent (e.g. sensors or brain areas), what kind of connectivity
is measured, and what temporal and spatial scales are probed. Here, I review
studies of large-scale connectivity and recent results from a variety of
real-time recording techniques, which together suggest that an adequate
description of brain organization requires a hierarchy of networks rather than
the single, binary networks that are currently in vogue. Pattern analysis methods
now offer a principled way for constructing such network hierarchies. As shown at
the end of this review, a correspondence principle can be formulated to guide the
interpretation across network levels and to relate nodes to well defined
anatomical entities.

Skilled reading requires mapping of visual text to sound and meaning. Because
reading relies on neural systems spread across the brain, a full understanding of
this cognitive ability involves the identification of pathways that communicate
information between these processing regions. In the past few years, diffusion
tensor imaging has been used to identify correlations between white matter
properties and reading skills in adults and children. White matter differences
have been found in left temporo-parietal areas and in posterior callosal tracts. 
We review these findings and relate them to possible pathways that are important 
for various aspects of reading. We describe how the results from diffusion tensor
imaging can be integrated with functional results in good and poor readers.

Reinforcement learning algorithms have provided some of the most influential
computational theories for behavioral learning that depends on reward and
penalty. After briefly reviewing supporting experimental data, this paper tackles
three difficult theoretical issues that remain to be explored. First, plain
reinforcement learning is much too slow to be considered a plausible brain model.
Second, although the temporal-difference error has an important role both in
theory and in experiments, how to compute it remains an enigma. Third, function
of all brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem and
basal ganglia, seems to necessitate a new computational framework. Computational 
studies that emphasize meta-parameters, hierarchy, modularity and supervised
learning to resolve these issues are reviewed here, together with the related
experimental data.

Perceptual organization or grouping is one of the central issues in vision
research. Recent reports in the neuroimaging literature suggest that perceptual
organization is mediated by distributed visual areas that range from the primary 
visual cortex (V1) to higher visual areas, depending on the availability of
grouping cues and on the weight of contribution of each visual area. Evidence
suggests that grouping by proximity and collinearity, and also perhaps
filling-in, involve V1, whereas grouping by similarity and symmetry seems to
depend on activation of higher visual areas. Further studies should include
deliberate controls for confounding factors such as attentional artifacts and
radial orientation bias, to clarify how spatiotemporal information in visual
areas is integrated to give rise to perceptual organization.

Object perception seems effortless to us, but it depends on intensive neural
processing across multiple stages in ventral pathway visual cortex. Shape
information at the retinal level is hopelessly complex, variable and implicit.
The ventral pathway must somehow transform retinal signals into much more
compact, stable and explicit representations of object shape. Recent findings
highlight key aspects of this transformation: higher-order contour derivatives,
structural representation in object-based coordinates, composite shape tuning
dimensions, and long-term storage of object knowledge. These coding principles
could help to explain our remarkable ability to perceive, distinguish, remember
and understand a virtual infinity of objects.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and adjacent areas of the medial frontal
cortex (MFC) have been implicated in monitoring behaviour and in detecting
errors. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the ACC not only registers the
occurrence of errors but also represents other aspects of the reinforcement
history that are crucial for guiding behaviour. Other studies raise the
possibility that dorsal MFC areas not only monitor behaviour but also actually
control response selection, particularly when the task in hand is changing. Many 
decisions are made in social contexts and their chances of success depend on what
other individuals are doing. Evaluation of other individuals is therefore crucial
for effective action selection, and some ACC regions are implicated in this
process.

To make deliberate decisions, we have to utilize detailed information about the
environment and our internal states. The ventral visual pathway provides detailed
information on object identity, including color and shape, to the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The VLPFC also receives motivational and emotional
information from the orbitofrontal cortex and subcortical areas, and computes the
behavioral significance of external events; this information can be used for
elaborate decision making or design of goal-directed behavior. In this review, we
discuss recent advances that are revealing the neural mechanisms that underlie
the coding of behavioral significance in the VLPFC, and the functional roles of
these mechanisms in decision making and action programming in the brain.

Recently, there has been renewed interest in the organization and neurobiology of
remote memory, and the pace of work in this area has accelerated. Yet the recent 
literature does not suggest that a consensus is developing, and there is
disagreement about both facts and their interpretation. This article undertakes a
comprehensive review of the three kinds of evidence that have been most prominent
in recent discussion: studies of retrograde amnesia in memory-impaired patients
who have well-characterized lesions, neuroimaging of healthy volunteers, and work
with experimental animals including lesion studies, imaging and mouse genetics.
The available evidence tells a coherent story and leads to some straightforward
conclusions about the neuroscience of remote memory.

The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), which is important for higher cognitive
activity, is also concerned with motivational operations; this is exemplified by 
its activity in relation to expectancy of rewards. In the LPFC, motivational
information is integrated with cognitive information, as demonstrated by the
enhancement of working-memory-related activity by reward expectancy. Such
activity would be expected to induce changes in attention and, subsequently, to
modify behavioral performance. Recently, the effects of motivation and emotion on
neural activities have been examined in several areas of the brain in relation to
cognitive-task performance. Of these areas, the LPFC seems to have the most
important role in adaptive goal-directed behavior, by sending top-down
attention-control signals to other areas of the brain.

One of the most salient ways in which our behavior changes during childhood and
adolescence is that we get better at working towards long-term goals, at ignoring
irrelevant information that could distract us from our goals, and at controlling 
our impulses - in other words, we exhibit improvements in cognitive control.
Several recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have examined the developmental
changes in brain structure and function that underlie improvements in working
memory and cognitive control. Increased recruitment of task-relevant regions in
the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and striatum over the course of
development is associated with better performance in a range of cognitive tasks. 
Further work is needed to assess the role of experience in shaping the neural
circuitry that underlies cognitive control.

The dorsal and ventral premotor areas, together with the primary motor cortex,
are believed to have major roles in preparing and executing limb movements.
Recent studies have expanded our knowledge of the dorsal and ventral premotor
areas, which occupy the lateral part of area 6 in the frontal cortex. It is
becoming clear that these two premotor areas, through involvement in distinct
cortical networks, take part in unique aspects of motor planning and decision
making. New lines of evidence also implicate the lateral premotor areas in
planning motor behavior and selecting actions.

In this review, we summarize recent evidence that perceptual learning can occur
not only under training conditions but also in situations of unattended and
passive sensory stimulation. We suggest that the key to learning is to boost
stimulus-related activity that is normally insufficient exceed a learning
threshold. We discuss how factors such as attention and reinforcement have
crucial, permissive roles in learning. We observe, however, that highly optimized
stimulation protocols can also boost responses and promote learning. This helps
to reconcile observations of how learning can occur (or fail to occur) in
seemingly contradictory circumstances, and argues that different processes that
affect learning operate through similar mechanisms that are probably based on,
and mediated by, neuromodulatory factors.

Attention selectively enhances the influence of neuronal responses conveying
information about relevant sensory attributes. Accumulating evidence suggests
that this selective neuronal modulation relies on rhythmic synchronization at
local and long-range spatial scales: attention selectively synchronizes the
rhythmic responses of those neurons that are tuned to the spatial and featural
attributes of the attended sensory input. The strength of synchronization is
thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency.
Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been 
demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups
phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-range connections. These
results point to a general computational role for selective synchronization in
dynamically controlling which neurons communicate information about sensory
inputs effectively.

Priming is a nonconscious form of memory in which an encounter with a stimulus
influences the subsequent identification, production or classification of the
same or a related stimulus. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that behavioral
priming is typically accompanied by reduced activity in several cortical regions.
We review recent studies that have concerned two key issues. First, specificity
effects produced by changes between study and test in either the physical
features of stimuli or the behavioral response reveal cortical sensitivity to the
perceptual, conceptual and stimulus-to-decision mapping properties of primed
items. Second, correlations between behavioral priming and activity reductions
are robust across a range of tasks and procedures in prefrontal regions but not
in posterior regions. On the basis of these recent studies, we suggest that the
reduction in cortical activity during priming involves at least two different
mechanisms.

Brain Institute, St Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.

Commissural formation in the mammalian brain is highly organised and regulated
both by the cell-autonomous expression of transcription factors, and by
non-cell-autonomous mechanisms including the formation of midline glial
structures and their expression of specific axon guidance molecules. These
mechanisms channel axons into the correct path and enable the subsequent
connection of specific brain areas to their appropriate targets. Several key
findings have been made over the past two years, including the discovery of novel
mechanisms of action that 'classical' guidance factors such as the Slits,
Netrins, and their receptors have in axon guidance. Moreover, novel guidance
factors such as members of the Wnt family, and extracellular matrix components
such as heparan sulphate proteoglycans, have been shown to be important for
mammalian brain commissure formation. Additionally, there have been significant
discoveries regarding the role of FGF signalling in the formation of midline
glial structures. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the
field that have contributed to our current understanding of commissural
development in the telencephalon.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disorders
characterized by social and emotional deficits, language impairments and
stereotyped behaviors that manifest in early postnatal life. The molecular
mechanisms that underlie ASDs are not known, but several recent developments
suggest that some forms of autism are caused by failures in activity-dependent
regulation of neural development. Mutations of several voltage-gated and
ligand-gated ion channels that regulate neuronal excitability and Ca2+ signaling 
have been associated with ASDs. In addition, Ca2+-regulated signaling proteins
involved in synapse formation and dendritic growth have been implicated in ASDs. 
These recent advances suggest a set of signaling pathways that might have a role 
in generating these increasingly prevalent disorders.

Neurexins and neuroligins are emerging as central organizing molecules for
excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses in mammalian brain.
They function as cell adhesion molecules, bridging the synaptic cleft.
Remarkably, each partner can trigger formation of a hemisynapse: neuroligins
trigger presynaptic differentiation and neurexins trigger postsynaptic
differentiation. Recent protein interaction assays and cell culture studies
indicate a selectivity of function conferred by alternative splicing in both
partners. An insert at site 4 of beta-neurexins selectively promotes GABAergic
synaptic function, whereas an insert at site B of neuroligin 1 selectively
promotes glutamatergic synaptic function. Initial knockdown and knockout studies 
indicate that neurexins and neuroligins have an essential role in synaptic
transmission, particularly at GABAergic synapses, but further studies are needed 
to assess the in vivo functions of these complex protein families.

Autism is a common and heterogeneous childhood neurodevelopmental disorder.
Analogous to broad syndromes such as mental retardation, autism has many
etiologies and should be considered not as a single disorder but, rather, as 'the
autisms'. However, recent genetic findings, coupled with emerging anatomical and 
functional imaging studies, suggest a potential unifying model in which
higher-order association areas of the brain that normally connect to the frontal 
lobe are partially disconnected during development. This concept of developmental
disconnection can accommodate the specific neurobehavioral features that are
observed in autism, their emergence during development, and the heterogeneity of 
autism etiology, behaviors and cognition.

Morphogen family proteins are now widely appreciated as axon guidance cues.
Because their roles as morphogens are highly conserved across phylogeny, their
functional conservation in axon guidance is now being rigorously examined. Recent
studies suggest that morphogens are important in shaping topographic projections 
in chick and Drosophila visual systems, a process that occurs even later in
development.

How can we hope to explain mechanistically the schizophrenic phenotype? Perhaps
through the reductionist approach of genetics, which is beginning to yield
biological clues. Growing evidence supports the view that the well-established
genetic risk factor DISC1 plays an important role in schizophrenia biology by
interacting with FEZ1 and NDEL1 during neurodevelopment and with the
phosphodiesterase PDE4B in neuronal cell signalling. Thus, DISC1 and its pathways
support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and provide a
mechanistic explanation for the characteristic cognitive deficits. Genetic
variants of DISC1 also predispose to related affective (mood) disorders. As a
consequence, we can speculate on the mechanisms of DISC1 action and possible
routes to treatment for these common, debilitating brain disorders.

Eye-specific visual connections are a prominent model system for exploring how
precise circuits develop in the CNS and, in particular, for addressing the role
of neural activity in synapse elimination and axon refinement. Recent experiments
have identified the features of spontaneous retinal activity that mediate
eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation, the synaptic events associated with
this process, and the importance of axon guidance cues for organizing the overall
layout of eye-specific maps. The classic model of ocular dominance column
development, in which spontaneous retinal activity plays a crucial role, has also
gained new support. Although many outstanding questions remain, the mechanisms
that instruct eye-specific circuit development are becoming clear.

In the developing nervous system, nerve cells and axons respond to various
attractive and repulsive guidance cues while traveling to their final
destination. Netrins are bifunctional guidance cues that attract several classes 
of axons but repel others. The response of an axon to netrins is dictated by the 
composition of netrin receptors on the cell surface and the internal state of the
growth cone. Recent analyses have identified several signal transduction pathways
that contribute to netrin-mediated guidance. A model emerges in which tyrosine
phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol signaling and regulation by Rho GTPases act
in concert to trigger extension of axons and turning of growth cones in response 
to Netrin1.

The polarity of neurotransmission mediated by the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)
type A receptor depends crucially on intracellular chloride concentration, which 
is largely determined by the expression and function of cation/chloride
co-transporters. Recent evidence shows how both activity and neurotrophic factors
can affect GABAergic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system through
their effects on the neuron-specific chloride-extruding transporter KCC2. In
particular, GABAergic neurotransmission early in development, sustained neuronal 
activity in mature networks and brain-derived neurotrophic factor each modulate
the expression or function of KCC2. The resulting changes in intracellular
chloride concentration alter the nature or strength of fast GABAergic
neurotransmission, profoundly affecting the development and function of neuronal 
networks.

In Drosophila, the larval neuromuscular junction is particularly tractable for
studying how synapses develop and function. In contrast to vertebrate central
synapses, each presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle cell is unique
and identifiable, and the wiring circuit is invariant. Thus, the full power of
Drosophila genetics can be brought to bear on a single, reproducibly
identifiable, synaptic terminal. Each individual neuromuscular junction
encompasses hundreds of synaptic neurotransmitter release sites housed in a chain
of synaptic boutons. Recent advances have increased our understanding of the
mechanisms that shape the development of both individual synapses--that is, the
transmitter release sites including active zones and their apposed glutamate
receptor clusters--and the whole synaptic terminal that connects a pre- and
post-synaptic cell.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are the principal inhibitory component of glial
scars, which form after damage to the adult central nervous system and act as a
barrier to regenerating axons. Recent findings have furthered our understanding
of the mechanisms that result in a failure of regeneration after spinal cord
injury and suggest that a multipartite approach will be required to facilitate
long-distance regeneration and functional recovery.

Fly visual circuits are organized into lattice-like arrays and layers. Recent
genetic studies have provided insights into how these reiterated structures are
assembled through stepwise processes and how precise connections are established 
during development. Afferent-derived morphogens, such as Hedgehog, play a key
role in organizing the overall structure by inducing and recruiting target
neurons and glia. In turn, the target-derived ligand DWnt4 guides
Frizzled2-expressing photoreceptor afferents to their proper destination.
Photoreceptor afferents select specific synaptic targets by forming adhesive
interactions and regulating actin cytoskeleton in growth cones. Target
specificity is probably achieved by restricting the expression of adhesive
molecules, such as Capricious, to appropriate presynaptic and postsynaptic
partners, and by differentially regulating the function of broadly expressed
adhesive molecules such as N-cadherin.

A major challenge in understanding the relationship between neural activity and
development, and ultimately behavior, is to control simultaneously the activity
of either many neurons belonging to specific subsets or specific regions within
individual neurons. Optimally, such a technique should be capable of both
switching nerve cells on and off within milliseconds in a non-invasive manner,
and inducing depolarizations or hyperpolarizations for periods lasting from
milliseconds to many seconds. Specific ion conductances in subcellular
compartments must also be controlled to bypass signaling cascades in order to
regulate precisely cellular events such as synaptic transmission. Light-activated
G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels, which can be genetically
manipulated and targeted to neuronal circuits, have the greatest potential to
fulfill these requirements.

Developmental mechanisms can shed light on how evolutionary diversity has arisen.
Invertebrate nervous systems offer a wealth of diverse structures and functions
from which to relate development to evolution. Individual homologous neurons have
been shown to have distinct roles in species with different behaviors. In
addition, specific neurons have been lost or gained in some phylogenetic
lineages. The ability to address the neural basis of behavior at the cellular
level in invertebrates has facilitated discoveries showing that species-specific 
behavior can arise from differences in synaptic strength, in neuronal structure
and in neuromodulation. The mechanisms involved in the development of neural
circuits lead to these differences across species.

The repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) is a membrane-bound protein that was
originally identified as an axon guidance molecule in the visual system.
Functional studies have revealed that it has roles in axon guidance and laminar
patterning in Xenopus and chick embryos, and in controlling cephalic neural tube 
closure in mouse embryos. The recent identification of neogenin as a receptor for
RGM has provided evidence of the diverse functions of this ligand-receptor pair. 
Re-expression of RGM is observed after injury in the adult human and rat central 
nervous systems. Inhibition of RGM enhances growth of injured axons and promotes 
functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats. Thus, re-expression of
embryonic repulsive cues in adult tissues contributes to failure of axon
regeneration in the central nervous system.

Targeting of glutamate receptors to synapses is an important event in both
developing and mature neurons. Glutamate receptors are delivered to nascent
synapses during synaptogenesis and to existing synapses during activity-dependent
synaptic strengthening. Increasing evidence suggests that glutamate receptors are
inserted into the plasma membrane before they accumulate at the synapse. Lateral 
diffusion of receptors occurs at both synaptic and non-synaptic membranes, and
glutamate receptors can exchange rapidly between synaptic and extrasynaptic
sites. In addition, recent studies show that postsynaptic scaffold molecules can 
be highly mobile. The dynamic nature of the synapse suggests that many mechanisms
might be involved in regulating synapse formation and synaptic plasticity.

Intermediate-term processes in memory formation.

Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.

Neuroscientists have invested considerable effort in attempting to elucidate the 
molecular mechanisms that mediate short-term and long-term forms of learning and 
memory. For instance, the discovery of long-term potentiation inspired a field
that has produced hundreds of studies examining both early and late forms of
long-term potentiation. And at the behavioral level, most neuroscientists
investigate either short- or long-term forms of memory or some combination of the
two. The general belief that plasticity was restricted to short- and long-term
temporal domains lasted for many years because of the apparent continuity of
memory and its molecular characterization from one domain to the other. In
cellular studies of plasticity, the short-term stage typically lasts in the range
of minutes, and requires modification of pre-existing proteins, whereas long-term
changes, such as synaptic growth, last for hours to days and require
transcription and translation. As both behavioral and cellular studies covered a 
wider range of temporal domains, from the initiation of brief memory to the
expression of long-lasting memory, it was at least tacitly assumed that these
studies also captured any intervening domains as well. However, between these two
temporal extremes lies a unique form of intermediate-term synaptic plasticity and
memory, which mechanistically is a blend of the early and late forms.

Recent functional imaging work supports the view that item and relational memory 
depend upon distinct encoding operations within the medial temporal lobe.
Specifically, emerging findings demonstrate that the level of engagement of
perirhinal cortex predicts later memory for individual items, whereas the level
of hippocampal processing correlates with later relational memory, or recovery of
additional episodic details. Furthermore, recent functional magnetic resonance
imaging evidence in humans suggests that medial temporal lobe cortical input
structures, the perirhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices, differentially
participate in the encoding of objects and their context, providing
domain-specific input to the hippocampus. Taken together, these data help to
construct a working model of how distinct medial temporal lobe structures
participate in episodic memory formation with domain-general relational binding
mechanisms supported by the hippocampus and provide emerging evidence for
domain-specificity within the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices.

Neuromodulation of central pattern generators in invertebrates and vertebrates.

Central pattern generators are subject to extensive modulation that generates
flexibility in the rhythmic outputs of these neural networks. The effects of
neuromodulators interact with one another, and modulatory neurons are themselves 
often subject to modulation, enabling both higher order control and indirect
interactions among central pattern generators. In addition, modulators often
directly mediate the interactions between functionally related central pattern
generators. In systems such as the vertebrate respiratory central pattern
generator, multiple pacemaker types interact to produce rhythmic output.
Modulators can then alter the relative contributions of the different pacemakers,
leading to substantial changes in motor output and hence to different behaviors. 
Surprisingly, substantial changes in some aspects of the circuitry of a central
pattern generator, such as a several-fold increase in synaptic strength, can
sometimes have little effect on the output of the CPG, whereas other changes have
profound effects.

Several recent studies report how laboratory-raised, non-human primates exposed
to tool use can exhibit intelligent behaviors, such as imitation and reference
vocal control, that are never seen in their wild counterparts. Tool-use training 
appears to forge a novel cortico-cortical connection that underlies this boost in
capacity, which normally exists only as latent potential in lower primates.
Although tool-use training is patently non-naturalistic, its marked effects on
brain organization and behavior could shed light on the evolution of higher
intelligence in humans.

Those inclined to relish in scientific controversy will not be disappointed by
the literature on the effects of sleep on memory. Opinions abound. Yet
refinements in the experimental study of these complex processes of sleep and
memory are bringing this fascinating relationship into sharper focus. A
longstanding position contends that sleep passively protects memories by
temporarily sheltering them from interference, thus providing precious little
benefit for memory. But recent evidence is unmasking a more substantial and
long-lasting benefit of sleep for declarative memories. Although the precise
causal mechanisms within sleep that result in memory consolidation remain
elusive, recent evidence leads us to conclude that unique neurobiological
processes within sleep actively enhance declarative memories.

The remarkable manipulative skill of the human hand is not the result of rapid
sensorimotor processes, nor of fast or powerful effector mechanisms. Rather, the 
secret lies in the way manual tasks are organized and controlled by the nervous
system. At the heart of this organization is prediction. Successful manipulation 
requires the ability both to predict the motor commands required to grasp, lift, 
and move objects and to predict the sensory events that arise as a consequence of
these commands.

The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are associated with abnormal,
correlated, low frequency, rhythmic burst activity in the subthalamic nucleus and
connected nuclei. Research into the mechanisms controlling the pattern of
subthalamic activity has intensified because therapies that manipulate the
pattern of subthalamic activity, such as deep brain stimulation and levodopa
administration, improve motor function in Parkinson's disease. Recent findings
suggest that dopamine denervation of the striatum and extrastriatal basal ganglia
profoundly alters the transmission and integration of glutamatergic cortical and 
GABAergic pallidal inputs to subthalamic neurons, leading to pathological
activity that resonates throughout the basal ganglia and wider motor system.

Emotion regulation is a process by which we control when and where emotions are
expressed. Paradigms used to study the regulation of emotion in humans examine
controlled responses to emotional stimuli and/or the inhibition of emotional
influences on subsequent behavior. These processes of regulation of emotion
trigger activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and inhibition of the
amygdala. A similar pattern of activation is seen in rodents during recall of
fear extinction, an example of emotional regulation. The overlap in circuitry is 
consistent with a common mechanism, and points toward future experiments designed
to bridge human and rodent models of emotion regulation.

Memory lets the past inform the present so that we can attain future goals. In
many species, these abilities require the hippocampus. Recent experiments, in
which memory demand was varied while overt behavior and the environment were kept
constant, have revealed firing patterns of hippocampal neurons that corresponded 
with memory demands and predicted performance. Although the active population
appeared to be 'place cells' that signalled location, it actually included cells 
the activity patterns of which distinguished the recent or pending history of
behavior during identical actions that occurred in the same place. Different
populations of hippocampal cells fired as a rat walked along the same spatial
path on the way to different goals, and coded past, present and pending events.
Other experiments provide converging data that neuronal activity is modulated by 
goal-directed behavioral episodes. Together, these firing patterns suggest a
testable mechanism of episodic memory coding: that hippocampal dynamics encode a 
temporally extended, hierarchically organized representation of goal-directed
behavior.

Low frequency rest tremor is one of the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease and
some of its animal models. Current physiological studies and models of the basal 
ganglia differ as to which aspects of neuronal activity are crucial to the
pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. There is evidence that neural
oscillations and synchronization play a central role in the generation of the
disease. However, parkinsonian tremor is not strictly correlated with the
synchronous oscillations in the basal ganglia networks. Rather, abnormal basal
ganglia output enforces abnormal thalamo-cortical processing leading to akinesia,
the main negative symptom of Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonian tremor has
probably evolved as a downstream compensatory mechanism.

Recent studies of focal injury to the cerebral cortex have demonstrated that the 
remaining, intact tissue undergoes structural and functional changes that could
play a substantial role in neurological recovery. New information regarding the
molecular and cellular environment in the adjacent, intact tissue has suggested
that waves of growth promotion and inhibition modulate the self-repair processes 
of the brain. Furthermore, recent studies have documented widespread
neurophysiological and neuroanatomical changes in regions remote from a focal
cortical injury, suggesting that entire cortical networks participate in the
recovery process.

Recent studies using functional optical imaging have revealed that cellular
memory traces form in different areas of the insect brain after olfactory
classical conditioning. These traces are revealed as increased calcium signals or
synaptic release from defined neurons, and include a short-lived trace that forms
immediately after conditioning in antennal lobe projection neurons, an early
trace in dopaminergic neurons, and a medium-term trace in dorsal paired medial
neurons. New molecular genetic tools have revealed that for normal behavioral
memory performance, synaptic transmission from the mushroom body neurons is
required only during retrieval, whereas synaptic transmission from dopaminergic
neurons is required at the time of acquisition and synaptic transmission from
dorsal paired medial neurons is required during the consolidation period. Such
experimental results are helping to identify the types of neurons that
participate in olfactory learning and when their participation is required.
Olfactory learning often occurs alongside crossmodal interactions of sensory
information from other modalities. Recent studies have revealed complex
interactions between the olfactory and the visual senses that can occur during
olfactory learning, including the facilitation of learning about subthreshold
olfactory stimuli due to training with concurrent visual stimuli.

The role of the cerebellum in motor control and learning has been largely
inferred from the effects of cerebellar damage. Recent work shows that cerebellar
damage produces greater impairment of movements that require predictive as
opposed to reactive control. This dissociation is consistent across many
different types of movement. Predictive control is crucial for fast and ballistic
movements, but impaired prediction can also affect slow movements, because of
increased reliance on time-delayed feedback signals. The new findings are
compatible with theories of cerebellar function, but still do not resolve whether
the cerebellum operates by predicting the optimal motor commands or future
sensory states. Prediction mechanisms must be learned and maintained through
comparisons between predicted and observed outcomes. New results show that not
all such error information is equivalent in driving cerebellar learning.

Computational models of rhythmic motor systems are valuable tools for the study
of motor pattern generation and control. Recent modeling advances, together with 
experimental results, suggest that rhythmic behaviors, such as breathing or
walking, are influenced by complex interactions among motor system components.
Such interactions occur at all levels of organization, from the subcellular
through to the cellular, synaptic, and network levels to the level of
neuromuscular interactions and that of the whole organism. Simultaneously, safety
mechanisms at all levels contribute to network stability and the generation of
robust motor patterns.

Circadian clocks control behavioral, physiological and metabolic rhythms via one 
or more transcriptional feedback loops. In animals, two conserved feedback loops 
are thought to keep circadian time by mediating rhythmic transcription in
opposite phases of the circadian cycle. Recent work in cyanobacteria nevertheless
demonstrates that rhythmic transcription is dispensable for circadian
timekeeping, raising the possibility that some features of the transcriptional
feedback loops in animals are also expendable. Indeed, one of the two feedback
loops is not necessary for circadian timekeeping in animals, but rhythmic
transcription and post-translational modifications are both essential for keeping
circadian time. These results not only confirm additional requirements within the
animal circadian timekeeping mechanism, but also raise important questions about 
the function of conserved, yet expendable, features of the circadian timekeeping 
mechanism in animals.

Pharmacological data clearly indicate that both muscarinic and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors have a role in the encoding of new memories. Localized
lesions and antagonist infusions demonstrate the anatomical locus of these
cholinergic effects, and computational modeling links the function of cholinergic
modulation to specific cellular effects within these regions. Acetylcholine has
been shown to increase the strength of afferent input relative to feedback, to
contribute to theta rhythm oscillations, activate intrinsic mechanisms for
persistent spiking, and increase the modification of synapses. These effects
might enhance different types of encoding in different cortical structures. In
particular, the effects in entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and hippocampus might
be important for encoding new episodic memories.

Recent advances in molecular genetics have produced many novel strategies for
directing the expression of both functional and regulatory elements in transgenic
mice. With the application of such approaches, the specific populations that
comprise CNS networks can be both visualized and manipulated. Transgenic methods 
now range from the use of specific enhancer elements and large genomic regions
assembled using BACs and PACs, to the use of gene targeting to a specific locus. 
In addition, the advent of transactivators and site-specific recombinases has
provided unprecedented spatial and temporal control for directing expression in
the CNS using a combination of appropriate alleles. As a result, the promise of
being able to use transgenics to target specific neuronal populations is now
being realized.

The spatiotemporal localization of neuronal signaling is important for triggering
neuronal responses in specific locations at precise times. Fluorescence resonance
energy transfer imaging enables measurement of spatiotemporal dynamics of
signaling activity in live neurons. Although the usefulness of fluorescence
resonance energy transfer is well recognized, there are many difficulties in
applying it, particularly when imaging in neuronal micro-compartments in
light-scattering brain tissue. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been
imaged using several techniques including intensity-based methods, fluorescence
lifetime imaging and fluorescence anisotropy imaging. These methods have
different advantages and disadvantages, and thus are suitable in different
applications.

Advanced optical imaging techniques used in neurobiology commonly employ
fluorescent molecules for studying the structure and function of neural tissue.
To obtain adequate spatio-temporal resolution, sophisticated scanning schemes are
used to manage the excitation light going to and emission light coming from
objects under observation. Although the fundamental principles of these
techniques remain the same, such as scanning point illumination and point
detection for confocal imaging, their physical implementation is the subject of
technological advance, for example, the advent of inertia-free discontinuous
scanning schemes. In general, the aims of these technological advances are to
improve the spatio-temporal resolution of and/or reduce potential photodamage
caused by optical imaging in live neural tissue. The number of recent advances in
scanning methods indicates their increasing importance in imaging techniques.

Synaptic communication between neurons and NG2+ cells.

Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Chemical synaptic transmission provides the basis for much of the rapid signaling
that occurs within neuronal networks. However, recent studies have provided
compelling evidence that synapses are not used exclusively for communication
between neurons. Physiological and anatomical studies indicate that a distinct
class of glia known as NG2(+) cells also forms direct synaptic junctions with
both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic signaling can influence
intracellular Ca(2+) levels in NG2(+) cells by activating Ca(2+) permeable AMPA
receptors, and these inputs can be potentiated through high frequency
stimulation. Although the significance of this highly differentiated form of
communication remains to be established, these neuro-glia synapses might enable
neurons to influence rapidly the behavior of this ubiquitous class of glial
progenitors.

Electron microscopy is the only currently available technique with a resolution
adequate to identify and follow every axon and dendrite in dense neuropil.
Reconstructions of large volumes of neural tissue, necessary to reconstruct even 
local neural circuits, have, however, been inhibited by the daunting task of
serially sectioning and reconstructing thousands of sections. Recent
technological developments have improved the quality of volume electron
microscopy data and automated its acquisition. This opens up the prospect of
reconstructing almost complete invertebrate and sizable fractions of vertebrate
nervous systems. Such reconstructions of complete neural wiring diagrams could
rekindle the tradition of relating neural function to the underlying
neuroanatomical circuitry.

A trace of silence: memory and microRNA at the synapse.

Avenue, Cambridge, MA, USA.

Identifying the neural circuits that mediate particular behaviors and uncovering 
their plasticity is an endeavor at the heart of neuroscience. This effort is
allied with the elucidation of plasticity mechanisms, because the molecular
determinants of plasticity can be markers for the neurons and synapses that are
modified by experience. Of particular interest is protein synthesis localized to 
the synapse, which might establish and maintain the stable modification of
neuronal properties, including the pattern and strength of synaptic connections. 
Recent studies reveal that microRNAs and the RISC pathway regulate synaptic
protein synthesis. Is synaptic activity of the RISC pathway a molecular signature
of memory?

Distinct neuronal cell types acquire and maintain their identity by expressing
different genes. Recently it has become feasible to measure this cell type
specific expression by isolating and amplifying mRNA from small populations of
fluorescently labeled neurons and probing this mRNA with microarrays. Prior to
this, most neuronal gene expression studies used tissue homogenates or randomly
selected single cells and were, therefore, not well suited to studying
transcriptional differences between cell types. Microarray studies of purified
cell types have enabled investigators to identify the transcriptional signatures 
of, for example, subtypes of pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the neocortex,
modulatory dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, and the striatal neurons that
form the so-called 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways through the basal ganglia.
These studies are opening up new approaches to understanding brain circuitry,
plasticity and pathology and are refining the concept of the neuronal cell type.

Neuregulins comprise a family of epidermal growth factor-like ligands that
interact with ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases to control many aspects of neural
development. One of the most dramatic effects of neuregulin-1 is on glial cell
differentiation. The membrane-bound neuregulin-1 type III isoform is an axonal
ligand for glial ErbB receptors that regulates the early Schwann cell lineage,
including the generation of precursors. Recent studies have shown that the amount
of neuregulin-1 type III expressed on axons also dictates the glial phenotype,
with a threshold level triggering Schwann cell myelination. Remarkably,
neuregulin-1 type III also regulates Schwann cell membrane growth to adjust
myelin sheath thickness to match axon caliber precisely. Whether this signaling
system operates in central nervous system myelination remains an open question of
major importance for human demyelinating diseases.

Schwann cells form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. All Schwann cells are
surrounded by a basal lamina. Extracellular matrix molecules in the basal lamina,
such as laminin, regulate key aspects of Schwann cell development including the
formation, architecture and function of myelin. Recent genetic and cell
biological experiments suggest that Schwann cells regulate the basal lamina and
its receptors in both time and space, resulting in differential functions. These 
findings have important implications for diseases resulting from laminin
dysfunction, such as congenital muscular dystrophy 1A.

The design and manipulation of proteins has created many tools that have become
popular in neurobiological studies, and new developments in protein science will 
be the fuel for future research. Genetically encoded protein-based biosensors
have been developed with a wider range of sensing moieties, enabling detection of
changes in localized protein synthesis, voltage, glutamate and/or glucose levels.
Existing sensors, such as cameleon, have been modified and improved. Heterologous
expression of Channelrhodopsin-2 and other light-gated methods for controlling
cellular polarization enable action potentials to be non-invasively evoked,
facilitating the study and modulation of behavior in intact animals. Finally, new
methods in protein manipulation, including the site-specific incorporation of
unnatural amino acids in vivo and the directed evolution of proteins, show
promise in elucidating neural function with greater precision and flexibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is now a well-established tool for inducing
transient changes in brain activity non-invasively in conscious human volunteers.
During the past couple of years, the ability to actively interfere with neural
processing during behavioral performance has been used increasingly for the
investigation of causal brain-behavior relationships in higher cognitive
functions. The simultaneous combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation with
methods of functional brain imaging, however, promises to be of especially great 
value for our understanding of the human brain, as it provides the opportunity to
stimulate brain circuits while simultaneously monitoring changes in brain
activity and behavior. Such an approach could help us to identify brain networks 
of functional relevance, and might enable causal brain-behavior inferences across
the entire brain.

Glial regulation of the axonal membrane at nodes of Ranvier.

Author information:

Farmington Avenue, Farmington CT 06032, USA.

Action potential conduction in myelinated nerve fibers depends on a polarized
axonal membrane. Voltage-gated Na(+) and K(+) channels are clustered at nodes of 
Ranvier and mediate the transmembrane currents necessary for rapid saltatory
conduction. Paranodal junctions flank nodes and function as attachment sites for 
myelin and as paracellular and membrane protein diffusion barriers. Common
molecular mechanisms, directed by myelinating glia, are used to establish these
axonal membrane domains. Initially, heterophilic interactions between glial and
axonal cell adhesion molecules define the locations where nodes or paranodes
form. Subsequently, within each domain, axonal cell adhesion molecules are
stabilized and retained through interactions with cytoskeletal and scaffolding
proteins, including ankyrins and spectrins.

A century and a half after first being described, glia are beginning to reveal
their intricate and important roles in nervous system development and function.
Recent studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that this
invertebrate will provide important insight into these roles. Studies of C.
elegans have revealed a connection between glial ensheathment of neurons and
tubulogenesis, have uncovered glial roles in neurite growth, navigation, and
function, and have demonstrated roles for glia and glia-like cells in synapse
formation and function. Given the conservation of basic anatomical, functional
and molecular features of the nervous systems between C. elegans and vertebrates,
these recent advances are likely to be informative in describing nervous system
assembly and function in all organisms possessing a nervous system.

Netrins are a small family of secreted proteins that are best known for their
role as secreted long-range chemotropic guidance cues. Extracellular gradients of
netrin protein, established by diffusion, are thought to direct cell and axon
migration during neural development. In addition to this long-range role, recent 
findings provide increasing support for short-range functions, in which secreted 
netrin protein remains closely associated with its cellular source. Emerging
evidence for short-range actions of netrins suggests that they contribute to
tissue morphogenesis by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion.

The avian auditory system has become a model system to investigate how
vocalizations are memorized and processed by the brain in order to mediate
behavioral discrimination and recognition. Recent studies have shown that most of
the avian auditory system responds preferentially and efficiently to sounds that 
have natural spectro-temporal statistics. In addition, neurons in secondary
auditory forebrain areas have plastic response properties and are the most active
when processing behaviorally relevant vocalizations. Physiological measurements
show differential responses for vocalizations that were recently learned in
discrimination tasks, and for the tutor song, a longer-term auditory memory that 
is used to guide vocal learning in male songbirds.

Pitch perception is crucial for vocal communication, music perception, and
auditory object processing in a complex acoustic environment. How pitch is
represented in the cerebral cortex has for a long time remained an unanswered
question in auditory neuroscience. Several lines of evidence now point to a
distinct non-primary region of auditory cortex in primates that contains a
cortical representation of pitch.

Gustatory processing: a dynamic systems approach.

Jones LM(1), Fontanini A, Katz DB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454, USA.

Recent gustatory studies have provided a growing body of evidence that taste
processing is dynamic and distributed, and the taste system too complex to be
adequately described by traditional feed-forward models of taste coding. Current 
research demonstrates that neuronal responses throughout the gustatory neuroaxis 
are broad, variable and temporally structured, as a result of the fact that the
taste network is extensive and heavily interconnected, containing modulatory
pathways, many of which are reciprocal. Multimodal influences (e.g. olfactory and
somatosensory) and effects of internal state (e.g. attention and expectation),
shown in both behavioral and neuronal responses to taste stimuli, add further
complexity to neural taste responses. Future gustatory research should extend to 
more brain regions, incorporate more connections, and analyze behaviors and
neuronal responses in both time- and state-dependent manners.

The vestibular system provides an attractive model for understanding how changes 
in cellular and synaptic activity influence learning and memory in a quantifiable
behavior, the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The vestibulo-ocular reflex produces eye
movements that compensate for head motion; simple yet powerful forms of motor
learning calibrate the circuit throughout life. Learning in the vestibulo-ocular 
reflex depends initially on the activity of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar
flocculus, but consolidated memories appear to be stored downstream of Purkinje
cells, probably in the vestibular nuclei. Recent studies have demonstrated that
the neurons of the vestibular nucleus possess the capacity for both synaptic and 
intrinsic plasticity. Mechanistic analyses of a novel form of firing rate
potentiation in neurons of the vestibular nucleus have revealed new rules of
plasticity that could apply to spontaneously firing neurons in other parts of the
brain.

Sensory regions of neocortex are organized as arrays of vertical columns composed
of cells that share similar response properties, with the orientation columns of 
the cat's visual cortex being the best known example. Interest in how sensitivity
to different stimulus features first emerges in the columns and how this
selectivity is refined by subsequent processing has fueled decades of research. A
natural starting point in approaching these issues is anatomy. Each column
traverses the six cortical layers and each layer has a unique pattern of inputs, 
intrinsic connections and outputs. Thus, it makes sense to explore the
possibility of corresponding laminar differences in sensory function, that is, to
examine relationships between morphology and physiology. In addition, to help
identify general patterns of cortical organization, it is useful to compare
results obtained from different sensory systems and diverse species. The picture 
that emerges from such comparisons is that each cortical layer serves a distinct 
role in sensory function. Furthermore, different cortices appear to share some
common strategies for processing information but also have specialized mechanisms
adapted for the demands of specific sensory tasks.

In vivo voltage clamp recordings have provided new insights into the synaptic
mechanisms that underlie processing in the primary auditory cortex. Of particular
importance are the discoveries that excitatory and inhibitory inputs have similar
frequency and intensity tuning, that excitation is followed by inhibition with a 
short delay, and that the duration of inhibition is briefer than expected. These 
findings challenge existing models of auditory processing in which broadly tuned 
lateral inhibition is used to limit excitatory receptive fields and suggest new
mechanisms by which inhibition and short term plasticity shape neural responses.

Animal navigation is a complex process involving the integration of many sources 
of specialized sensory information for navigation in near and far space. Our
understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of near-space navigation is
well-developed, whereas the neural mechanisms of long-distance navigation are
just beginning to be unraveled. One crucial question for future research is
whether the near space concepts of place cells, head direction cells, and maps in
the entorhinal cortex scale up to animals navigating over very long distances and
whether they are related to the map and compass concepts of long-distance
navigation.

Rats sweep their vibrissae through space to locate objects in their immediate
environment. In essence, their view of the proximal world is generated through
pliable hairs that tap and palpate objects. The texture and shape of those
objects must be discerned for the rat to assess the value of the object.
Furthermore, the location of those objects must be specified with reference to
the position of the rat's head for the rat to plan its movements. Recent in vivo 
and in vitro electrophysiological measurements provide insight into the
algorithms and mechanisms that underlie these behavioral-based computations.

The impact of photoreceptor noise on retinal gain controls.

Dunn FA(1), Rieke F.

Author information: 
(1)Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, University of Washington, Seattle,
98195, USA.

Multiple retinal mechanisms preserve visual sensitivity as the properties of the 
light inputs change. Rapid gain controls match the effective signaling range of
retinal neurons to the local image statistics. Such gain controls trade an
increased sensitivity for some aspects of the inputs for a decreased sensitivity 
to others. Rapid, local gain control comes at another cost: noise in the signal
controlling gain (e.g. from the photoreceptors) will cause gain itself to vary
even when the statistics of the light input are constant. Recent advances in
identifying retinal pathways and the sites and mechanisms of mean and contrast
adaptation have begun to clarify the tradeoffs associated with different gain
control locations and how these tradeoffs differ for rod and cone vision.

Ocular dominance plasticity has long served as a successful model for examining
how cortical circuits are shaped by experience. In this paradigm, altered retinal
activity caused by unilateral eye-lid closure leads to dramatic shifts in the
binocular response properties of neurons in the visual cortex. Much of the recent
progress in identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ocular
dominance plasticity has been achieved by using the mouse as a model system. In
this species, monocular deprivation initiated in adulthood also causes robust
ocular dominance shifts. Research on ocular dominance plasticity in the mouse is 
starting to provide insight into which factors mediate and influence cortical

Progress in the study of electrosensory systems has been facilitated by the
systematic use of behavior as a tool to probe the nervous system. Indeed, a
specific behavior that is found in a subset of weakly electric fishes, the
jamming avoidance response, was used to identify and characterize an entire suite
of brain circuits, from sensory receptors to motor units, that are involved in
control of this behavior. Recent progress has focused on a re-analysis of this
circuit in relation to newly described electrosensory behaviors, including prey
capture, social signaling and the tracking of electrosensory objects. This
re-analysis has led to a re-evaluation of the broader functional relevance of
specific neural solutions to computational problems that are related to the
control of the jamming avoidance response. Some of the recent insights that have 
emerged from this work include descriptions of mechanisms underlying dynamic
receptive field properties, descriptions of the neural activity related to
simultaneously occurring sensory stimuli, and a greater understanding of the role
of short-term synaptic plasticity in temporal processing.

Objects and events can often be detected by more than one sensory system.
Interactions between sensory systems can offer numerous benefits for the accuracy
and completeness of the perception. Recent studies involving visual-auditory
interactions have highlighted the perceptual advantages of combining information 
from these two modalities and have suggested that predominantly unimodal brain
regions play a role in multisensory processing.

Specialized species often reveal general principles of brain organization and
provide systems for analysis of sensory function. Subterranean species dependent 
on touch have particularly large somatosensory areas with modular cortical
representations of sensory surfaces. Some species have added cortical areas to
processing networks, have developed tactile foveas and have superior colliculi
primarily devoted to somatosensation rather than vision. Recent studies reveal
surprisingly large cortical representations of oral structures in primates and
mole-rats. Cortical modules represent a range of different sensory surfaces in
rodents, star-nosed moles and primates, indicating that similar developmental
mechanisms operate in diverse species. Finally, manipulation of patterning genes 
in mice suggests evolutionary mechanisms for producing the specialized corticies 
of subterranean species.

How are objects represented in the brain? Two facets of this question are
currently under investigation. First, are objects represented by activity in a
relatively small number of neurons that are each selective for the shape or
identity of a specific object (a 'sparse code'), or are they represented by a
pattern of activity across a large number of less selective neurons (a
'population code')? Second, how are the neurons that code for an object
distributed across the cortex: are they clustered together in patches, or are
they scattered widely across the cortex? The results from neurophysiology and
functional magnetic resonance imaging studies are beginning to provide
preliminary answers to both questions.

Nociceptive circuitry processes the signals evoked by activating specialized
peripheral sensory receptors for pain perception. Recent studies show that the
neuronal phenotypes in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal dorsal horn are
determined by distinct sets of transcription factors during development.
Anatomical analyses with genetic approaches demonstrate that each subset of
nociceptive sensory neurons has topographically distinct circuits at both spinal 
and brain levels. Moreover, the sensitivity of primary afferents can be rapidly
regulated not only by phosphorylation of receptors, ion channels and associated
regulatory proteins but also by stimulus-induced cell surface expression of
G-protein-coupled receptors. In chronic pain states the molecular characteristics
of spinal nociceptive circuits are altered, enabling normal peripheral stimuli to
induce pain hypersensitivity.

Recent advances in functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques
demonstrate that the spatial spread and amplitude of whisker functional
representation in the somatosensory cortex of the adult rodent is extensive, but 
subject to modulations. One of the strongest modulators is naturalistic whisker
use. In the cortices of rodents that have been transferred from their home cage
to live for an extensive period in a naturalistic habitat, there is suppression
of evoked neuronal responses accompanied by contraction and sharpening of
receptive fields, and contraction and weakening of whisker functional
representations. These unexpected characteristics also describe modulations of
whisker functional representations in the cortex of a freely exploring rodent
during short whisker-based explorations. These and related findings suggest that 
cortical modulations and plasticity could follow a 'less is more' strategy and,
therefore, highlight how different cortical strategies could be utilized for
different behavioral demands.

Behavioral analysis is essential to understand how the olfactory system
transforms chemosensory signals into information that can be used to guide
actions. Recent studies in rodents have begun to address the behavioral relevance
of putative olfactory codes and computations including spatial maps, oscillatory 
synchrony, and evolving temporal codes. To date, these studies have failed to
find support for a role of any of these mechanisms in odor discrimination.
Progress calls for experiments using precise psychophysical methods in
conjunction with neural recording or perturbation, in addition to ethologically
minded exploration of more complex forms of odor-guided behavior.

Acetylcholine is the specific chemical code of spinal nerve terminal transmission
at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), whereas nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors inserted into the membrane of muscle fibres mediate signalling for the 
muscle response. Glutamate has a primary role in neuromuscular transmission of
organisms that are phylogenetically distant from mammals, the invertebrates,
including insect and molluscs. Recent research has shown that diverting
descending glutamatergic fibres in the spinal cord to rat skeletal muscle by
means of a peripheral nerve graft causes the cholinergic synapse to switch to the
glutamatergic type. These data demonstrate that under appropriate surgical
manipulation supraspinal neurons can directly target muscle fibres and specify
the postsynaptic receptors to achieve a functional glutamatergic NMJ.

In neuronal cells, proteins are synthesized on ribosomes from the genetic
information encoded in DNA. In some instances translation takes place at the
neuronal cell soma but in other it occurs at distal location, such as in a
dendritic spine. Folding is usually initiated before the completion of protein
synthesis and its outcome strictly depends on the local environment in which the 
nascent protein is submerged. Incompletely folded proteins and, more importantly,
misfolded proteins are under the surveillance of several quality control systems 
that re-establish the correct conformation or initiate protein degradation.
Regulation and maintenance of these systems is a vital issue for neuronal and
glial cells, and impairments at different levels leads to neurodegenerative
diseases.

Long-term plasticity typically relies on postsynaptic NMDA receptors to detect
the coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic activity. Recent studies, however, have 
revealed forms of plasticity that depend on coincidence detection by presynaptic 
NMDA receptors. In the amygdala, cortical afferent associative presynaptic
long-term potentiation (LTP) requires activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors by
simultaneous thalamic and cortical afferents. Surprisingly, both types of
afferent can also undergo postsynaptically induced NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP.
In the neocortex, spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (LTD) requires
simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA autoreceptors and retrograde
signalling by endocannabinoids. In cerebellar LTD, presynaptic NMDA receptor
activation suggests that similar presynaptic mechanisms may exist. Recent studies
also indicate the existence of presynaptic coincidence detection that is
independent of NMDA receptors, suggesting that such mechanisms have a widespread 
role in plasticity.

Brain insults cause rapid cell death, and a disruption of functional circuits, in
the affected regions. As the injured tissue recovers from events associated with 
cell death, regenerative processes are activated that over months lead to a
certain degree of functional recovery. Factors produced by new neurons and glia, 
axonal sprouting of surviving neurons, and new synapse formation help to
re-establish some of the lost functions. The timing and location of such events
is crucial in the success of the regenerative process. Comprehensive gene
expression profiling and proteomic analyses have enabled a deeper molecular and
cellular mechanistic understanding of post-injury brain regeneration. These new
mechanistic insights are aiding the design of novel therapeutic modalities that
enhance regeneration.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate most fast excitatory synaptic
transmission in the brain. Diversity in excitatory signalling arises, in part,
from functional differences among AMPAR subtypes. Although the rapid insertion or
deletion of AMPARs is recognised as important for the expression of conventional 
forms of long-term synaptic plasticity--triggered, for example, by Ca2+ entry
through NMDA-type glutamate receptors--only recently has attention focused on
novel forms of plasticity that are regulated by, or alter the expression of,
Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. The dynamic regulation of these receptors is important for
normal synaptic function and in disease states.

Synaptic vesicles are clustered at the presynaptic terminal where they fuse and
recycle in response to stimulation. Vesicles appear to be sorted into pools, but 
we do not yet understand how physiologically defined pools relate to
morphological pools. The advent of dynamic imaging approaches has led to an
appreciation of the regulation of vesicle mobility. Newly endocytosed vesicles
are highly mobile but appear to become transiently trapped as they re-enter the
recycling pool. Recent experiments indicate that endocytosis might have a
constant rate, but limited capacity. How endocytosis is linked to exocytosis
remains unclear, although calcium emerges as an important player.

mRNA localization and regulated translation play central roles in neurite
outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. A key molecule in these processes is the
Fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, which is involved in the metabolism
of neuronal mRNAs. Absence or mutation of FMRP leads to spine dysmorphogenesis
and impairs synaptic plasticity. Studies that have mainly been performed on the
mouse and Drosophila models for Fragile X Syndrome showed that FMRP is involved
in translational regulation at synapses, but even 15 years after discovery of the
FMR1 gene, the precise working mechanisms remain elusive.

Compelling evidence supports contributions of glutamate receptor overactivation
('excitotoxicity') to neurodegeneration in both acute conditions, such as stroke,
and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
However, anti-excitotoxic therapeutic trials, which have generally targeted
highly Ca2+ permeable NMDA-type glutamate channels, have to date failed to
demonstrate impressive efficacy. Whereas most AMPA type glutamate channels are
Ca2+ impermeable, an evolving body of evidence supports the contention that
relatively unusual Ca2+ permeable AMPA channels might be crucial contributors to 
injury in these conditions. These channels are preferentially expressed in
discrete neuronal subpopulations, and their numbers appear to be upregulated in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke. In addition, unlike NMDA channels, Ca2+
permeable AMPA channels are not blocked by Mg2+, but are highly permeable to
another potentially harmful endogenous cation, Zn2+. The targeting of these
channels might provide efficacious new avenues in the therapy of certain
neurological diseases.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules have been implicated in a number
of non-immune roles in the central nervous system, particularly in synaptic
development and plasticity. The discovery of M10 (50% sequence identity to
classical MHC molecules) proteins expressed in the vomeronasal organ adds to the 
list of non-traditional roles of MHC homologs. M10 molecules associate with the
V2R class of vomeronasal receptors, a family of G-protein coupled receptors
thought to function as pheromone receptors. Recent studies showing that classical
MHC-binding peptides activate V2R-expressing neurons offer tempting clues that
M10s might participate directly in the recognition of pheromone ligands, but M10 
proteins do not bind to these peptides with significant affinity. Instead of
presenting MHC-binding peptides, M10s might function as molecular chaperones to
V2R receptors or more generally as modulators of neuronal function, as
demonstrated elsewhere in the brain for classical MHC molecules.

The clustered protocadherins comprise the largest subfamily of the cadherin
superfamily and are predominantly expressed in the nervous system. The family of 
clustered protocadherins (clustered Pcdh family) is substructured into three
distinct gene arrays in mammals: Pcdh-alpha, Pcdh-beta, and Pcdh-gamma. These are
regulated by multiple promoters and cis-alternative splicing without DNA
recombination. Pcdh-alpha proteins interact with beta1-integrin to promote cell
adhesion. They also form oligomers with Pcdh-gamma proteins at the same membrane 
sites. During neuronal maturation, Pcdh-alpha expression is dramatically
downregulated by myelination. The clustered Pcdh family has multiple variable
exons that differ somewhat in number and sequence across vertebrate species. At
the single-cell level, Pcdh-alpha mRNAs are regulated monoallelically, resulting 
in the combinatorial expression of distinct variable exons from each allele.
These findings support the idea that diversified Pcdh molecules contribute to
neural circuit development and provide individual cells with their specific
identity.

Sex and reproduction sculpt brain and behavior throughout life and evolution. In 
vertebrates, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential to these
processes. Recent advances have uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms in GnRH
signaling, such as the initiation of sexual maturation by kisspeptins. Yet
despite our increasing molecular knowledge, we know very little about
environmental influences on GnRH signaling and reproductive behavior. Alternative
model systems have been crucial for understanding the plasticity of GnRH effects 
within an organismal context. For instance, GnRH signaling is under the control
of seasonal cues in songbirds, whereas social signals regulate GnRH in cichlid
fishes, with crucial consequences for reproduction and behavior. Analyzing
cellular signaling cascades within an organismic context is essential for an
integrative understanding of GnRH function.

The polarized morphology of neurons poses a particular challenge to intracellular
signal transduction. Local signals generated at distal sites must be retrogradely
transported to the nucleus to produce persistent changes in neuronal function.
Such communication of signals between distal neuronal compartments and the
nucleus occurs during axon guidance, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity and
following neuronal injury. Recent studies have begun to delineate a role for the 
active nuclear import pathway in transporting signals from axons and dendrites to
the nucleus. In this pathway, soluble cargo proteins are recognized by nuclear
transport carriers, called importins, which mediate their translocation from the 
cytoplasm into the nucleus. In neurons, importins might serve an additional
function by carrying signals from distal sites to the soma.

The stargazin gene (also referred to as Cacng2) has been identified by forward
genetics in a spontaneous mouse mutant with ataxic gait, upward head-elevating
movements (hence the name stargazer for the mouse) and episodes of spike-wave
discharges. Stargazin is related to the gamma-1 subunit of skeletal muscle
voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC), and a deficit in its role as auxiliary 
VDCC subunit was proposed to underlie the epileptic phenotype of the mouse; yet, 
a conclusive demonstration of stargazin function in VDCC regulation is still
lacking. In contrast, stargazin and its three closely related isoforms gamma-3,
gamma-4 and gamma-8 were shown to function as auxiliary subunits for a very
different ion channel - the AMPA-type glutamate receptor - prominently regulating
early intracellular transport, synaptic targeting and anchoring, and ion channel 
functions of this major excitatory receptor in the brain.

Exocytosis unbound.

The accepted theory of vesicular release of neurotransmitter posits that only a
single vesicle per synapse can fuse with the membrane following action potential 
invasion, and this exocytotic event is limited to the ultrastructurally defined
presynaptic active zone. Neither of these dictums is universally true. At certain
synapses, more than a single vesicle can be released per action potential, and
there is growing evidence that neuronal exocytosis can occur from sites that are 
unremarkable in electron micrographs. The first discrepancy extends the dynamic
range of synapses, whereas the second enables faster and more robust chemical
transmission at sites distant from morphologically defined synapses. Taken
together, these attributes expand the capabilities of cellular communication in
the nervous system.

The processes and mechanisms implicated in retention and retrieval of memories as
they age is an enduring problem in cognitive neuroscience. Research from lesion
and functional neuroimaging studies on remote episodic, semantic and spatial
memory in humans is crucial for evaluating three theories of hippocampal and/or
medial temporal lobe-neocortical interaction in memory retention and retrieval:
cognitive map theory, standard consolidation theory and multiple trace theory.
Each theory makes different predictions regarding first, the severity and extent 
of retrograde amnesia following lesions to some or all of the structures
mentioned; second, the extent of activation of these structures to retrieval of
memory across time; and third, the type of memory being retrieved. Each of these 
theories has strengths and weaknesses, and there are various unresolved issues.
We propose a unified account based on multiple trace theory. This theory states
that the hippocampus is needed for re-experiencing detailed episodic and spatial 
memories no matter how old they are, and that it contributes to the formation and
assimilation of semantic memories and schematic spatial maps.

Reflections of other minds: how primate social cognition can inform the function

Mirror neurons, located in the premotor cortex of macaque monkeys, are activated 
both by the performance and the passive observation of particular goal-directed
actions. Although this property would seem to make them the ideal neural
substrate for imitation, the puzzling fact is that monkeys simply do not imitate.
Indeed, imitation appears to be a uniquely human ability. We are thus left with a
fascinating question: if not imitation, what are mirror neurons for? Recent
advances in the study of non-human primate social cognition suggest a surprising 
potential answer.

By using multi-electrode arrays or optical imaging, investigators can now record 
from many individual neurons in various parts of nervous systems simultaneously
while an animal performs sensory, motor or cognitive tasks. Given the large
multidimensional datasets that are now routinely generated, it is often not
obvious how to find meaningful results within the data. The analysis of
neuronal-population recordings typically involves two steps: the extraction of
relevant dynamics from neural data, and then use of the dynamics to classify and 
discriminate features of a stimulus or behavior. We focus on the application of
techniques that emphasize interactions among the recorded neurons rather than
using just the correlations between individual neurons and a perception or a
behavior. An understanding of modern analysis techniques is crucially important
for researchers interested in the co-varying activity among populations of
neurons or even brain regions.

Recent results challenge and refine the prevailing view of the way language is
represented in the human brain. Syntactic knowledge and processing mechanisms
that implement syntax in use are mapped onto neural tissue in experiments that
harness both syntactic concepts and imaging technologies to the study of brain
mechanisms in healthy and impaired populations. In the emerging picture, syntax
is neurologically segregated, and its component parts are housed in several
distinct cerebral loci that extend beyond the traditional ones - Broca's and
Wernicke's regions in the left hemisphere. In particular, the new brain map for
syntax implicates portions of the right cerebral hemisphere.

Developmental prosopagnosia is characterized by severely impaired face
recognition. Individuals with this disorder, which often runs in families, have
no history of brain damage and intact early visual processing systems. Recent
research has also demonstrated that many developmental prosopagnosics have normal
or relatively good object recognition, indicating that their impairments are not 
the result of deficits to a unitary visual recognition mechanism. To investigate 
the nature of the impaired mechanisms, extensive testing was done on an
individual with especially pure face processing deficits. The results ruled out
all extant explanations of prosopagnosia except one that proposed that faces are 
recognized by a content-specific face processing mechanism. fMRI and MEG studies 
show that there are a variety of neural profiles in developmental prosopagnosia, 
which is consistent with behavioral studies demonstrating that it is a
heterogeneous disorder.

Following the suggestion that midbrain dopaminergic neurons encode a signal,
known as a 'reward prediction error', used by artificial intelligence algorithms 
for learning to choose advantageous actions, the study of the neural substrates
for reward-based learning has been strongly influenced by computational theories.
In recent work, such theories have been increasingly integrated into experimental
design and analysis. Such hybrid approaches have offered detailed new insights
into the function of a number of brain areas, especially the cortex and basal
ganglia. In part this is because these approaches enable the study of neural
correlates of subjective factors (such as a participant's beliefs about the
reward to be received for performing some action) that the computational theories
purport to quantify.

The capability of the adult primate visual system for rapid and accurate
recognition of targets in cluttered, natural scenes far surpasses the abilities
of state-of-the-art artificial vision systems. Understanding this capability
remains a fundamental challenge in visual neuroscience. Recent experimental
evidence suggests that adaptive coding strategies facilitated by underlying
neural plasticity enable the adult brain to learn from visual experience and
shape its ability to integrate and recognize coherent visual objects.

Experiments using functional neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation
in humans have revealed regions of the parietal lobes that are specialized for
particular visuomotor actions, such as reaching, grasping and eye movements. In
addition, the human parietal cortex is recruited by processing and perception of 
action-related information, even when no overt action occurs. Such information
can include object shape and orientation, knowledge about how tools are employed 
and the understanding of actions made by other individuals. We review the known
subregions of the human posterior parietal cortex and the principles behind their
organization.

The neural substrate of sequence learning is well known. However, we lack a clear
understanding of the detailed functional properties of many of the areas
involved. The reason for this discrepancy lies, in part, in the fact that two
types of processes, implicit and explicit, subserve motor sequence learning, and 
these often interact with each other. The most significant recent advances have
been the elucidation of the very complex relationships between medial motor areas
and the temporal and ordinal control of sequences, and the demonstration that
motor cortex is an important site for sequence storage and production. The
challenge for the future will be to develop a coherent and internally consistent 
theory of sequence control.

Multivariate genetic research suggests that a single set of genes affects most
cognitive abilities and disabilities. This finding already has far-reaching
implications for cognitive neuroscience, and will become even more revealing when
this - presumably large - set of generalist genes is identified. Similar to other
complex disorders and dimensions, molecular genetic research on cognitive
abilities and disabilities is adopting genome-wide association strategies. These 
strategies involve very large samples to detect DNA associations of small effect 
size using microarrays that simultaneously assess hundreds of thousands of DNA
markers. When this set of generalist genes is identified, it can be used to
provide solid footholds in the climb towards a systems-level understanding of how
genetically driven brain processes work together to affect diverse cognitive
abilities and disabilities.

Advances in cognitive neuroscience now allow us to use physiological techniques
to measure and assess mental states under a growing set of circumstances. The
implication of this growing ability has not been lost on the western legal
community. If biologists can accurately measure mental state, then legal
conflicts that turn on the true mental states of individuals might well be
resolvable with techniques ranging from electroencephalography to functional
magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, legal practitioners have increasingly
sought to employ cognitive neuroscientific methods and data as evidence to
influence legal proceedings. This poses a risk, because these scientific
methodologies have largely been designed and validated for experimental use only.
Their subsequent use in legal proceedings is an application for which they were
not intended, and for which those methods are inadequately tested. We propose
that neurobiologists, who might inadvertently contribute to this situation,
should be aware of how their papers will be read by the legal community and
should play a more active role in educating and engaging with that community.

Ample evidence suggests that upon their retrieval, items in long-term memory
enter a transient special state, in which they might become prone to change. The 
process that generates this state is dubbed 'reconsolidation'. The dominant
conceptual framework in this revitalized field of memory research focuses on
whether reconsolidation resembles consolidation, which is the process that
converts an unstable short-term memory trace into a more stable long-term trace. 
However, this emphasis on the comparison of reconsolidation to consolidation
deserves reassessment. Instead, the phenomenon of reconsolidation, irrespective
of its relevance to consolidation, provides a unique opportunity to tap into the 
molecular, cellular and circuit correlates of memory persistence and retrieval,
of which we currently know only little.

The profusion of progress during the past twenty years in identifying neural
correlates of selective attention within the visual system has left open the
question of how visual representations are biased to favor target stimuli.
Studies aimed at specifying the mechanisms that can be causally implicated in the
control of visual selective attention have only recently begun in earnest.
Employing both the psychophysical and the neuroanatomical data, recent
neurophysiological experiments in monkeys and neuroimaging studies in humans are 
converging on the neural circuits that provide the source of at least some forms 
of attentional control signals.

The combined efforts of many fields are advancing our understanding of how number
is represented. Researchers studying numerical reasoning in adult humans,
developing humans and non-human animals are using a suite of behavioral and
neurobiological methods to uncover similarities and differences in how each
population enumerates and compares quantities to identify the neural substrates
of numerical cognition. An important picture emerging from this research is that 
adult humans share with non-human animals a system for representing number as
language-independent mental magnitudes and that this system emerges early in
development.

Recent data identify distinct components of social cognition associated with five
brain regions. In posterior temporal cortex, the extrastriate body area is
associated with perceiving the form of other human bodies. A nearby region in the
posterior superior temporal sulcus is involved in interpreting the motions of a
human body in terms of goals. A distinct region at the temporo-parietal junction 
supports the uniquely human ability to reason about the contents of mental
states. Medial prefrontal cortex is divided into at least two subregions. Ventral
medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in emotional empathy, whereas dorsal
medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in the uniquely human representation of
triadic relations between two minds and an object, supporting shared attention
and collaborative goals.

Standard economic theories conceive homo economicus as a rational decision maker 
capable of maximizing utility. In reality, however, people tend to approximate
optimal decision-making strategies through a collection of heuristic routines.
Some of these routines are driven by emotional processes, and others are adjusted
iteratively through experience. In addition, routines specialized for social
decision making, such as inference about the mental states of other decision
makers, might share their origins and neural mechanisms with the ability to
simulate or imagine outcomes expected from alternative actions that an individual
can take. A recent surge of collaborations across economics, psychology and
neuroscience has provided new insights into how such multiple elements of
decision making interact in the brain.

The formation of synaptic connections during the development of the nervous
system requires the precise targeting of presynaptic and postsynaptic
compartments. Furthermore, synapses are continually modified in the brain by
experience. Recently, the ubiquitin proteasome system has emerged as a key
regulator of synaptic development and function. The modification of proteins by
ubiquitin, and in many cases their subsequent proteasomal degradation, has proven
to be an important mechanism to control protein stability, activity and
localization at synapses. Recent work has highlighted key questions of the UPS
during the development and remodeling of synaptic connections in the nervous
system.

Synaptogenesis is a finely organized process, intriguing in its precise temporal 
and spatial resolution. It occurs as the dendrite of a postsynaptic neuron and an
incoming axon communicate at defined sites to establish a stable synapse
together. The molecular cues that guide synaptogenesis are now beginning to be
identified, and cell surface interactions at synaptic sites participate
prominently in the key steps. Interactions include trans-synaptic adhesion of
pre- and post-synaptic neurons but also binding to non-neuronal neighboring cells
and the extracellular matrix. These signals recruit scaffolding molecules, other 
adhesion molecules, and neurotransmitter receptors to bring together the key
components of functional synapses. Recent progress provides stimulating insights 
into the role of adhesion and signaling molecules in the formation and function
of synaptic specializations.

Two anatomical patterns characterize the neocortex, and both are essential for
normal cortical function. First, neocortex is divided into anatomically distinct 
and functionally specialized areas that form a species-specific map. Second,
neocortex is composed of layers that organize cortical connectivity. Recent
studies of layer and area development have used time-lapse microscopy to follow
cortical cell division and migration, gene arrays to find layer- or area-
specific regulatory genes, time- and region- specific manipulations of candidate 
genes, and optical imaging to compare area maps in wild type with genetically
altered mice. New observations clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
generate each pattern, and stress the links between layer and area formation.

Our knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance along the
antero-posterior axis in contrast to the dorso-ventral axis of the developing
nervous system is very limited. During the past two years in vitro and in vivo
studies have indicated that morphogens have a role in longitudinal axon guidance.
Morphogens are secreted proteins that act in a concentration-dependent manner on 
susceptible groups of precursor cells and induce their differentiation to a
specific cell fate. Thus, gradients of morphogens are responsible for the
appropriate patterning of the nervous system during early phases of neural
development. Therefore, it was surprising to find that gradients of two of these 
morphogens, Wnt4 and Shh, can be re-used for longitudinal axon guidance during
later stages of nervous system development.

The evolving roles of axonally synthesized proteins in regeneration.

Author information:

Work emerging during the past decade has shown that axons, similar to dendrites, 
are capable of autonomously generating new proteins through translation of
localized mRNAs. Even in mammals, neurons maintain the ability to target mRNAs
and translational machinery into the axonal compartment well into adulthood. The 
biological functions of axonal protein synthesis in adult neurons are just now
being revealed, and recent studies indicate that locally synthesized proteins
facilitate regeneration. Local translation, in addition to protein degradation,
is needed for growth cone formation after axotomy, for generating a retrogradely 
transported injury signal, and then to help structurally maintain the growing
axon. Regulation of axonal protein synthesis by exogenous stimuli might provide a
means to facilitate regeneration for neuronal populations that normally show poor
regenerative capacity in the adult nervous system.

Cognitive function and memory rely on synaptic plasticity - the ability of
synapses to modify their strength in response to stimulation. Emerging evidence
indicates that post-transcriptional gene regulation is necessary for synaptic
plasticity at several levels: by increasing proteome diversity through
alternative splicing, or by enabling activity-dependent regulation of mRNA
localization, translation or degradation in the dendrite. Mouse knockout studies 
have linked three RNA-binding proteins, fragile X mental retardation protein,
cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor and neuro-oncological ventral 
antigen to specific aspects of synaptic plasticity. Specificity in the regulation
of synaptic plasticity might, in part, relate to the functional coherence of
proteins encoded by the RNA targets of each RNA-binding protein.

During the past years, major advances have been made in understanding the
sequential events involved in neural plate patterning. Positional information is 
already conferred to cells of the neural plate at the time of its induction in
the ectoderm. The interplay between the BMP- and the Fgf- signaling pathways
leads to the induction of neural cell fates. Thus, neural induction and neural
plate patterning are overlapping processes. Later, at the end of gastrulation,
positional cell identities within the neural plate are refined and maintained by 
the action of several neural plate organizers. By locally emitting signaling
molecules, they influence the fate of the developing nervous system with high
regional specificity. Recent advances have been made both in understanding the
mechanisms that dictate the relative position of these organizers and in how
signaling molecules spread from them with high spatial and temporal resolution.

With the identification of the molecular determinants of neuronal connectivity,
our understanding of the extracellular information that controls axon guidance
and synapse formation has evolved from single factors towards the complexity that
neurons face in a living organism. As we move in this direction - ready to see
the forest for the trees - attention is returning to one of the most ancient
regulators of cell-cell interaction: the extracellular matrix. Among many matrix 
components that influence neuronal connectivity, recent studies of the heparan
sulfate proteoglycans suggest that these ancient molecules function as versatile 
extracellular scaffolds that both sculpt the landscape of extracellular cues and 
modulate the way that neurons perceive the world around them.

Topographic maps, in which the spatial order of neurons maps smoothly onto their 
axonal target, are a central feature of neural wiring. Ephrins and Eph receptors 
are well accepted as graded labels for map development, enabling current studies 
into molecular principles of mapping. Ephrins regulate axon growth either
positively or negatively, leading to models in which axons terminate at a neutral
or optimum point in the gradient. Axonal competition ensures the target is
filled. Ephrins and Ephs are typically expressed in complex overlapping patterns,
with implications for signaling mechanisms, scale of internal map features, and
coordinated interconnection of multiple mapping modules. Recent studies of Wnt3
and En-2 show that topographic axon guidance cues may be as diverse as molecules 
previously regarded as morphogens and transcription factors.

Cell signaling molecules secreted from strategically localized positions
coordinate cell behavior to enable progressive specification of embryonic
tissues. These molecules converge on a few signaling pathways that are
reiteratively used in different tissues at different times for generating cell
type-specific patterns of gene expression. Although our current knowledge of the 
system is fragmentary, eye development seems to follow this general strategy. In 
line with this idea, recent studies have added new information on how Fgf and Wnt
signaling participates in the formation of the eye field. In addition, later on
in development, Fgf controls the onset of retinal neurogenesis and Shh and GDF11 
control its feedback regulation.

Glial cells are not passive spectators during nervous system assembly, rather
they are active participants that exert significant control over neuronal
development. Well-established roles for glia in shaping the developing nervous
system include providing trophic support to neurons, modulating axon pathfinding,
and driving nerve fasciculation. Exciting recent studies have revealed additional
ways in which glial cells also modulate neurodevelopment. Glial cells regulate
the number of neurons at early developmental stages by dynamically influencing
neural precursor divisions, and at later stages by promoting neuronal cell death 
through engulfment. Glia also participate in the fine sculpting of neuronal
connections by pruning excess axonal projections, shaping dendritic spines, and
secreting multiple factors that promote synapse formation and functional
maturation. These recent insights provide further compelling evidence that glial 
cells, through their diverse cellular actions, are essential contributors to the 
construction of a functionally mature nervous system.

The intricate connections of the nervous system are established, in part, by
elongating axonal fibers that are directed by complex guidance systems to home in
on their specific targets. The growth cone, the major motile apparatus at the tip
of axons, explores its surroundings and steers the axon along a defined path to
its appropriate target. Significant progress has been made in identifying the
guidance molecules and receptors that regulate growth cone pathfinding, the
signaling cascades underlying distinct growth cone behaviors, and the
cytoskeletal components that give rise to the directional motility of the growth 
cone. Recent studies have also shed light on the sophisticated mechanisms and new
players utilized by the growth cone during pathfinding. It is clear that axon
pathfinding requires a growth cone to sample and integrate various signals both
in space and in time, and subsequently to coordinate the dynamics of its
membrane, cytoskeleton and adhesion to generate specific responses.

Studies of the vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular junction led to an influential
model of how neurotransmitter receptors accumulate in the postsynaptic membrane. 
In this model, motor axons organize postsynaptic development by secreting
neuregulin to induce acetylcholine receptor gene transcription in specialized
subsynaptic nuclei, agrin to cluster diffuse receptors in the postsynaptic
membrane, and acetylcholine to evoke electrical activity that promotes synaptic
maturation. However, new studies in this area have first, demonstrated that axons
sometimes innervate pre-existing receptor clusters; second, recast the roles of
agrin and neuregulin; third, revealed early effects of neurotransmission; fourth,
questioned the role of subsynaptic myonuclei; fifth, shown that
elaborately-branched postsynaptic structures can form aneurally; and sixth,
raised the possibility that neurotransmitter affects receptor type as well as
distribution. These recent studies challenge the widely-held paradigms, although 
not the results that led to them, and suggest a new model for neuromuscular
synaptogenesis.

The olfactory system discriminates a large number of odorants using precisely
wired neural circuits. It offers an excellent opportunity to study mechanisms of 
neuronal wiring specificity at the single synapse level. Each olfactory receptor 
neuron typically expresses only one olfactory receptor from many receptor genes
(1000 in mice). In mice, this striking singularity appears to be ensured by a
negative feedback mechanism. Olfactory receptor neurons expressing the same
receptor converge their axons to stereotypical positions with high precision, a
feature that is conserved from insects to mammals. Several molecules have
recently been identified that control this process, including olfactory receptors
themselves in mice. The second order neurons, mitral cells in mammals and
projection neurons in insects, have a similar degree of wiring specificity:
studies in Drosophila suggest that projection neuron-intrinsic mechanisms
regulate their precise dendritic targeting. Finally, recent studies have revealed
interactions of different cell types during circuit assembly, including axon-axon
interactions among olfactory receptor neurons and dendro-dendritic interactions
of projection neurons, that are essential in establishing wiring specificity of
the olfactory circuit.

Excitatory synapses are formed on dendritic spines, postsynaptic structures that 
change during development and in response to synaptic activity. Once mature,
however, spines can remain stable for many months. The molecular mechanisms that 
control the formation and elimination, motility and stability, and size and shape
of dendritic spines are being revealed. Multiple signaling pathways, particularly
those involving Rho and Ras family small GTPases, converge on the actin
cytoskeleton to regulate spine morphology and dynamics bidirectionally. Numerous 
cell surface receptors, scaffold proteins and actin binding proteins are
concentrated in spines and engaged in spine morphogenesis.

The generation of dorsal interneurons in the spinal cord is dependent upon
specific signaling pathways and the subsequent establishment of progenitor
domains mediated by cross-repressive interactions of different groups of
transcription factors. These events lead to the implementation of specific
differentiation programs that direct the development of distinct dorsal
interneuron subtypes. Recent studies have taken advantage of complementary gain
and loss-of-function studies in the chick and mouse to clarify the in vivo roles 
of transforming growth factor beta signaling, basic helix-loop-helix and
homeodomain transcription factors in dorsal interneuron development. The
challenge now lies in identifying the precise molecular mechanisms involved and
applying these insights to understanding how more ventrally located dorsal
interneurons are specified.

In recent years different lines of evidence have led to the idea that motor
actions and movements in both vertebrates and invertebrates are composed of
elementary building blocks. The entire motor repertoire can be spanned by
applying a well-defined set of operations and transformations to these primitives
and by combining them in many different ways according to well-defined syntactic 
rules. Motor and movement primitives and modules might exist at the neural,
dynamic and kinematic levels with complicated mapping among the elementary
building blocks subserving these different levels of representation. Hence, while
considerable progress has been made in recent years in unravelling the nature of 
these primitives, new experimental, computational and conceptual approaches are
needed to further advance our understanding of motor compositionality.

The social brain hypothesis proposes that large neocortex size in Homonoids
evolved to cope with the increasing demands of complex group living and greater
numbers of interindividual relationships. Group living requires that individuals 
communicate effectively about environmental and internal events. Recent data have
highlighted the complexity of chimpanzee communication, including graded facial
expressions and referential vocalizations. Among Hominoids, elaborate facial
communication is accompanied by specializations in brain areas controlling facial
movement. Finally, the evolution of empathy, or emotional awareness, might have a
neural basis in specialized cells in the neocortex, that is, spindle cells that
have been associated with self-conscious emotions, and mirror neurons that have
recently been shown to activate in response to communicative facial gestures.

Computational models can provide useful guidance in the design of behavioral and 
neurophysiological experiments and in the interpretation of complex, high
dimensional biological data. Because many problems faced by the primate brain in 
the control of movement have parallels in robotic motor control, models and
algorithms from robotics research provide useful inspiration, baseline

The field of basal ganglia research is exploding on every level - from
discoveries at the molecular level to those based on human brain imaging. A
remarkable series of new findings support the view that the basal ganglia are
essential for some forms of learning-related plasticity. Other new findings are
challenging some of the basic tenets of the field as it now stands. Combined with
the new evidence on learning-related functions of the basal ganglia, these
studies suggest that the basal ganglia are parts of a brain-wide set of adaptive 
neural systems promoting optimal motor and cognitive control.

Dynamic perturbations of reaching movements are an important technique for
studying motor learning and adaptation. Adaptation to non-contacting,
velocity-dependent inertial Coriolis forces generated by arm movements during
passive body rotation is very rapid, and when complete the Coriolis forces are no
longer sensed. Adaptation to velocity-dependent forces delivered by a robotic
manipulandum takes longer and the perturbations continue to be perceived even
when adaptation is complete. These differences reflect adaptive self-calibration 
of motor control versus learning the behavior of an external object or 'tool'.
Velocity-dependent inertial Coriolis forces also arise in everyday behavior
during voluntary turn and reach movements but because of anticipatory feedforward
motor compensations do not affect movement accuracy despite being larger than the
velocity-dependent forces typically used in experimental studies. Progress has
been made in understanding: the common features that determine adaptive responses
to velocity-dependent perturbations of jaw and limb movements; the transfer of
adaptation to mechanical perturbations across different contact sites on a limb; 
and the parcellation and separate representation of the static and dynamic
components of multiforce perturbations.

The notion that the olivocerebellar system is crucial for motor learning is well 
established. In recent years, it has become evident that there can be many forms 
of both synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity within this system and that each
might have a different role in developing and maintaining motor learning across a
wide range of tasks. There are several possible molecular and cellular mechanisms
that could underlie adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and eyeblink
conditioning. Although causal relationships between particular cellular processes
and individual components of a learned behaviour have not been demonstrated
unequivocally, an overall picture is emerging that the different types and sites 
of cellular plasticity relate importantly to the stage of learning and/or its
temporal specifics.

Recent advances in our knowledge of the neural mechanisms of imitation suggest
that there is a core circuitry of imitation comprising the superior temporal
sulcus and the 'mirror neuron system', which consists of the posterior inferior
frontal gyrus and adjacent ventral premotor cortex, as well as the rostral
inferior parietal lobule. This core circuitry communicates with other neural
systems according to the type of imitation performed. Imitative learning is
supported by interaction of the core circuitry of imitation with the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex and perhaps motor preparation areas--namely, the mesial
frontal, dorsal premotor and superior parietal areas. By contrast, imitation as a
form of social mirroring is supported by interaction of the core circuitry of
imitation with the limbic system.

Smooth-pursuit eye movements are used to stabilize the image of a moving object
of interest on the fovea, thus guaranteeing its high-acuity scrutiny. Such
movements are based on a phylogenetically recent cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathway
that has evolved in parallel with foveal vision. Recent work has shown that a
network of several cerebrocortical areas directs attention to objects of interest
moving in three dimensions and reconstructs the trajectory of the target in
extrapersonal space, thereby integrating various sources of multimodal sensory
and efference copy information, as well as cognitive influences such as
prediction. This cortical network is the starting point of a set of parallel
cerebrofugal projections that use different parts of the dorsal pontine nuclei
and the neighboring rostral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis as intermediate
stations to feed two areas of the cerebellum, the flocculus-paraflocculus and the
posterior vermis, which make mainly complementary contributions to the control of
smooth pursuit.

Object memory and perception in the medial temporal lobe: an alternative
approach.

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) includes several structures--the hippocampus, and 
the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices--that have been 
associated with memory for at least the past 50 years. These components of the
putative 'MTL memory system' are thought to operate together in the service of
declarative memory--memory for facts and events--having little or no role in
other functions such as perception. Object perception, however, is thought to be 
independent of the MTL, and instead is usually considered to be the domain of the
ventral visual stream (VVS) or 'what' pathway. This 'textbook' view fits squarely
into the prevailing paradigm of anatomical modularisation of psychological
function in the brain. Recent studies, however, question this view, indicating
that first, the MTL is functionally heterogeneous, and second, structures in the 
MTL might have a role in perception. Furthermore, the specific contributions of
the individual structures within the MTL are being elucidated. These new findings
indicate that it might no longer be useful to assume a strict functional
dissociation between the MTL and the VVS, and that psychological functions might 
not be modularised in the way usually assumed. We propose an alternative approach
to understanding the functions of these brain regions in terms of what
computations they perform, and what representations they contain.

There is now general agreement that the posterior parietal cortex is part of the 
motor system. New data have confirmed its fundamental role in visuomotor
transformations. Most interestingly, recent data showed that the inferior
parietal lobule codes motor acts (such as grasping) in a specific way according
to the action in which they are embedded. This particular motor organization
appears to provide a neural mechanism for higher order cognitive motor functions,
including understanding of intention. These functions, and peripersonal space
representation, are represented in areas of the inferior parietal lobule, where
visual information from both the dorsal and the ventral stream is integrated with
motor information.

Sensory cues in the environment can predict the availability of reward. Through
experience, humans and animals learn these predictions and use them to guide
their actions. For example, we can learn to discriminate chanterelles from
ordinary champignons through experience. Assuming the development of a taste for 
the complex and lingering flavors of chanterelles, we therefore learn to value
the same action--picking mushrooms--differentially depending upon the appearance 
of a mushroom. One major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to understand the
neural mechanisms that underlie this sort of learning. Because the acquisition of
rewards motivates much behavior, recent efforts have focused on describing the
neural signals related to learning the value of stimuli and actions. Neurons in
the basal ganglia, in midbrain dopamine areas, in frontal and parietal cortices
and in other brain areas, all modulate their activity in relation to aspects of
learning. By training monkeys on various behavioral tasks, recent studies have
begun to characterize how neural signals represent distinct processes, such as
the timing of events, motivation, absolute (objective) and relative (subjective) 
valuation, and the formation of associative links between stimuli and potential
actions. In addition, a number of studies have either further characterized
dopamine signals or sought to determine how such signaling might interact with
target structures, such as the striatum and rhinal cortex, to underlie learning.

FoxP2 mutations in humans are associated with a disorder that affects both the
comprehension of language and its production, speech. This discovery provided the
first opportunity to analyze the genetics of language with molecular and
neurobiological tools. The amino acid sequence and the neural expression pattern 
of FoxP2 are extremely conserved, from reptile to man. This suggests an important
role for FoxP2 in vertebrate brains, regardless of whether they support imitative
vocal learning or not. Its expression pattern pinpoints neural circuits that
might have been crucial for the evolution of speech and language, including the
basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Recent studies in songbirds show that during
times of song plasticity FoxP2 is upregulated in a striatal region essential for 
song learning. This suggests that FoxP2 plays important roles both in the
development of neural circuits and in the postnatal behaviors they mediate.

The study of population dynamics in hippocampal place cells has emerged as one of
the most powerful tools for understanding the encoding, storage and retrieval of 
declarative memory. Recent work has laid out the contours of an attractor-based
hippocampal population code for memory in recurrent circuits of the hippocampus. 
The code is based on inputs from a topographically organized,
path-integration-dependent spatial map that lies upstream in the medial
entorhinal cortex. The recurrent networks of the hippocampal formation enable
these spatial inputs to be synthesized with nonspatial event-related information.

Both mammals and birds can flexibly organize their behavior over time. In
mammals, the mental operations generating this ability are called executive
functions and are associated with the prefrontal cortex. The corresponding
structure in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale. Anatomical, neurochemical,
electrophysiological and behavioral studies show these structures to be highly
similar. The avian forebrain displays no lamination that corresponds to the
mammalian neocortex, hence lamination does not seem to be a requirement for
higher cognitive functions. Because all other aspects of the neural architecture 
of the mammalian and the avian prefrontal areas are extremely comparable, the
freedom to create different neural architectures that generate prefrontal
functions seems to be very limited.

Social experiences throughout life influence gene expression and behavior,
however, early in development these influences have a particularly profound
effect. In mammals, mother-infant interactions are the primary source of social
stimulation and result in long-term changes in offspring phenotype. This has
previously been demonstrated in rodents and primates, however, recent studies in 
rats have advanced our understanding of how these influences are achieved at a
mechanistic level, through epigenetic modification, and provide a model for
studying the transmission of social behavior across generations. These studies
emphasize the importance of a life-history approach to the study of brain
development; incorporating information about genetic background, prenatal and
postnatal maternal care received, and post-weaning social interactions of an
individual, in addition to the social environment experienced by previous
generations.

Fear extinction, the reduction of fear by repeated exposure to the object of
fear, is a crucial paradigm of inhibitory learning and the acknowledged
preclinical model for behavior therapy of human anxiety. Recent insights have
clarified roles for infralimbic prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and periaqueductal
gray in extinction learning, while maintaining a central role for the basolateral
amygdaloid nucleus in the acquisition and storage of this learning.
Simultaneously, molecular insights have implicated several neurotransmitter and
second messenger systems in extinction learning, and revealed that extinction is 
surprisingly easy to improve, yielding the promise of a novel approach to
improved psychiatric treatments for a variety of human anxiety disorders.

Synaptic plasticity -- the modulation of synaptic strength between a presynaptic 
terminal and a postsynaptic dendrite -- is thought to be a mechanism that
underlies learning and memory. It has become increasingly clear that regulated
protein synthesis is an important mechanism used to regulate the protein content 
of synapses that results in changes in synaptic strength. Recent experiments have
highlighted a role for the opposing process, that is, regulated protein
degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in synaptic plasticity. These
recent findings raise exciting questions as to how proteasomal activity can
regulate synapses over different temporal and spatial scales.

Conventional organic fluorophores suffer from poor photo stability, narrow
absorption spectra and broad emission spectra. Semiconductor nanocrystals,
however, are highly photo-stable with broad absorption spectra and narrow
size-tunable emission spectra. Recent advances in the synthesis of these
materials have resulted in the generation of bright, sensitive, extremely
photo-stable and biocompatible semiconductor fluorophores. Commercial
availability facilitates their application in a variety of unprecedented
biological experiments, including multiplexed cellular imaging, long-term in
vitro and in vivo labeling, deep tissue structure mapping and single particle
investigation of dynamic cellular processes. Semiconductor nanocrystals are one
of the first examples of nanotechnology enabling a new class of biomedical
applications.

Role reversal: the regulation of neuronal gene expression by microRNAs.

In a similar fashion to transcription factors, non-coding RNAs can be essential
regulators of gene expression. The largest class of non-coding RNAs is the
microRNAs. These approximately 22 nt double-stranded RNA molecules can repress
translation or target mRNA degradation. There has been a surge of research in the
past year stimulated by the recent availability of specialized techniques, both
in vitro and in silico, for predicting and characterizing microRNAs. The
accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of gene
expression during development. The combined actions of microRNAs and
transcription factors are able to tune the expression of proteins on a global
level in a manner that cannot be achieved by transcription factors alone.

Today, neuroscientists have access to a host of advanced techniques -- ranging
from targeted genetic interventions to brain imaging -- that are rapidly
providing new insights. Ultimately, however, memory must be inferred from its
behavioral read-out. Thus, to fully utilize the advanced technologies available
today, we must select the most appropriate behavioral procedures from those
currently available, or else devise novel behavioral techniques to meet a
specific demand. If we merely use standard tests of memory in a non-optimal way, 
we risk collecting incomplete information and reaching erroneous conclusions.
Relevant to these issues, there have been substantial developments in the methods
used to evaluate two of the most frequently studied forms of memory in the rodent
-- recognition memory and spatial memory.

The many faces of REST oversee epigenetic programming of neuronal genes.

Nervous system development relies on a complex signaling network to engineer the 
orderly transitions that lead to the acquisition of a neural cell fate.
Progression from the non-neuronal pluripotent stem cell to a restricted neural
lineage is characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression, particularly
the restriction of neuronal gene expression to neurons. Concurrently, cells
outside the nervous system acquire and maintain a non-neuronal fate that
permanently excludes expression of neuronal genes. Studies of the transcriptional
repressor REST, which regulates a large network of neuronal genes, provide a
paradigm for elucidating the link between epigenetic mechanisms and neurogenesis.
REST orchestrates a set of epigenetic modifications that are distinct between
non-neuronal cells that give rise to neurons and those that are destined to
remain as nervous system outsiders.

Harmonic analysis on manifolds and graphs has recently led to mathematical
developments in the field of data analysis. The resulting new tools can be used
to compress and analyze large and complex data sets, such as those derived from
sensor networks or neuronal activity datasets, obtained in the laboratory or
through computer modeling. The nature of the algorithms (based on diffusion maps 
and connectivity strengths on graphs) possesses a certain analogy with neural
information processing, and has the potential to provide inspiration for modeling
and understanding biological organization in perception and memory formation.

There is growing interest in late-LTP and late-LTD, that is, distinct forms of
functional plasticity that require somatic functions such as protein synthesis in
addition to the transient synaptic processes that are required for short lasting 
forms. Interestingly, to date only these forms of lasting plastic events could be
detected in healthy, freely moving animals and thus, they are considered as
physiological cellular models of learning and memory formation. Late-LTP and -LTD
are characterized by 'synaptic tagging' or 'capture' and 'synaptic
cross-tagging', but there are only a few laboratories that can currently perform 
experiments studying these properties. In brain slice work, there are many
different approaches to investigate these processes using different
methodological variations: some allow slices to rest for long periods before the 
experiment starts, others do not; some run their experiments at near to
physiological temperatures, others at lower temperatures; some stimulate
frequently, others do not.

There is a wide range of literature on soft lithography, organic surface science 
(especially self-assembled monolayers of organic thiols adsorbed on gold) and
microfluidics. These areas have developed in the fields of physical and surface
chemistry, materials science and condensed matter physics, but they offer broad
new capabilities in the development of relevant micro- and nanosystems to users
in biology in general, and in cell biology in particular. The ability to
integrate these techniques for fabricating materials and for controlling the
chemistry of surfaces with electrical and electrochemical measurements should be 
especially relevant in neurobiology. The major impediment to the development of a
field of 'microfabrication and measurement' in neuroscience is the absence of
effective collaborative interactions between the communities of fabricators and
neurobiologists.

Immediate-early genes have gained widespread popularity as activity markers for
mapping neuronal circuits involved in specific behaviors in many different
species. In situ immediate early gene detection methods provide cellular level
resolution, a major benefit for mapping neuronal networks. Recent advances using 
fluorescence in situ hybridization also afford temporal resolution, enabling
within-animal activity maps for two distinct behaviors. Moreover, use of
transgenic mice with fluorescent reporter proteins driven by immediate early gene
promoters is enabling repeated measurements, over long time scales, of cortical
activity within the same animal. These methodological innovations, coupled with
recent advances in fluorescence imaging and probe development, will enable large 
scale mapping of behaviorally relevant circuits with temporal and
three-dimensional spatial resolution in experimental animals.

If we are to understand how the brain performs different integrated functions in 
cellular terms, we need both to understand all relevant levels of analysis from
the molecular to the behavioural and cognitive levels and to realize an
integration of such levels. This is currently a major challenge for neuroscience.
Most research, whether dealing with perception, action or learning, focuses on a 
few levels of organization, for instance the molecular level and brain imaging,
and leaves other crucial areas practically untouched. To reach the level of
understanding that we desire, a multi-level approach is required in which the
different levels link into each other. It is possible to bridge across the
different levels for one system, and this has been demonstrated, for example, in 
the lamprey in generation of goal-directed locomotion. It can be argued that an
integrated analysis of any neural system cannot be performed without the aid of a
close interaction between experiments and modelling. The dynamic processing
within any neural system is such that an intuitive interpretation is rarely
sufficient.

Glial cells are now emerging from the shadows cast by their more excitable CNS
counterparts. Within the developing nervous system, astrocytes and Schwann cells 
actively help to promote synapse formation and function, and have even been
implicated in synapse elimination. In the adult brain, astrocytes respond to
synaptic activity by releasing transmitters that modulate synaptic activity.
Thus, glia are active participants in brain function. Many questions remain about
the identity of glial-neuronal signals and their significance.

Neural stem cells continually generate new neurons in very limited regions of the
adult mammalian central nervous system. In the neurogenic regions there are
unique and highly specialized microenvironments (niches) that tightly regulate
the neuronal development of adult neural stem cells. Emerging evidence suggests
that glia, particularly astrocytes, have key roles in controlling multiple steps 
of adult neurogenesis within the niches, from proliferation and fate
specification of neural progenitors to migration and integration of the neuronal 
progeny into pre-existing neuronal circuits in the adult brain. Identification of
specific niche signals that regulate these sequential steps during adult
neurogenesis might lead to strategies to induce functional neurogenesis in other 
brain regions after injury or degenerative neurological diseases.

Touch and go: guidance cues signal to the growth cone cytoskeleton.

Growth cones, the highly motile tips of growing axons, guide axons to their
targets by responding to molecular cues. Growth cone behaviors such as advancing,
retracting, turning and branching are driven by the dynamics and reorganization
of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton through signaling pathways linked to
guidance cue receptors. Actin filaments play a major part in growth cone
motility, and because of their peripheral locations were thought to be the
primary target of molecular cues. However, recent studies have shown that dynamic
microtubules can penetrate the growth cone periphery where guidance molecules can
influence them directly. Moreover, guidance cues can regulate growth cone
steering by modulating dynamic actin-microtubule interactions.

While building the nervous system, regions of some developing axons are
eliminated; this can also happen as a result of axonal injury. During
development, many axon branches that are formed in excess of an organism's needs 
are fated for removal in a process called axon pruning. By contrast, when axons
are injured the axon segment distal to the injury site is compartmentalized and
eliminated. In both cases, the end result is similar -- a region of an axon is
selected for removal. Recent evidence suggests that there are some similarities
in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate axon elimination in
development and during axonal injury.

Quantifying similarity and dissimilarity of spike trains is an important
requisite for understanding neural codes. Spike metrics constitute a class of
approaches to this problem. In contrast to most signal-processing methods, spike 
metrics operate on time series of all-or-none events, and are, thus, particularly
appropriate for extracellularly recorded neural signals. The spike metric
approach can be extended to multineuronal recordings, mitigating the 'curse of
dimensionality' typically associated with analyses of multivariate data. Spike
metrics have been usefully applied to the analysis of neural coding in a variety 
of systems, including vision, audition, olfaction, taste and electric sense.

Modulation of neuronal protein trafficking and function by palmitoylation.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry and the Brain Research Center, University of British 
Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Modification of proteins with the lipid palmitate regulates targeting to specific
vesicular compartments and synaptic membranes. Mounting evidence indicates that
this lipid modification modulates diverse aspects of neuronal development and
synaptic transmission. In particular, palmitoylation regulates the function of
proteins that control neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding and filopodia 
formation. In addition, trafficking of numerous proteins associated with synaptic
vesicle release machinery requires protein palmitoylation. Remarkably, reversible
palmitoylation of specific scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules
dynamically regulates ion channel clustering and synaptic strength. The recent
discovery of enzymes that palmitoylate specific subsets of synaptic proteins
suggests that this process is tightly controlled in neurons.

The evolution of the neocortex in mammals: how is phenotypic diversity generated?

Davis, CA, USA. lakrubitzer@ucdavis.edu

Evolution of the mammalian neocortex is difficult to examine directly. For this
reason, comparative studies and developmental studies are the best way of gaining
insight into the evolutionary process. Comparative studies indicate that
neocortical evolution is constrained, and that the types of systems-level
modifications made to the neocortex are limited. Developmental studies of gene
expression suggest that genetic contingencies set up aspects of cortical
organization and connectivity, and that the complex spatial and temporal
interactions of genes constrain development and evolution. Although genes
obviously contribute to phenotypic variability, variability can also be achieved 
through alterations in the sensory receptor arrays, or changes in sensory driven 
activity. The intracellular mechanisms that enable phenotypic variability might
evolve, but often the phenotypic characteristic in question is context-dependent.

Somewhere between the retina and our conscious visual experience, the majority of
the information impinging on the eye is lost. We are typically aware of only
either the most salient parts of a visual scene or the parts that we are actively
paying attention to. Recent research on visual neurons in monkeys is beginning to
show how the brain both selects and discards incoming visual information. For
example, what happens to the responses of visual neurons when attention is
directed to one element, such as an oriented colored bar, embedded among an array
of other oriented bars? Some of this research shows that attention to the
oriented bar restricts the receptive field of visual neurons down to this single 
element. However, other research shows that attention to this single element
affects the responses of neurons with receptive fields throughout the visual
field. In this review, these two seemingly contradictory results are shown to
actually be mutually consistent. A simple computational model is described that
explains these results, and also provides a framework for predicting a variety of
additional neurophysiological, neuroimaging and behavioral studies of attention.

Neurons of the visual, auditory and vestibular systems that signal through graded
changes in membrane potential rely upon synaptic ribbons for the exquisite
control of neurotransmitter release. Although clearly important for tonic
neurotransmission, the precise role of synaptic ribbons remains elusive. In
recent years, several genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological and optical
approaches have begun to shed light on the functions of these enigmatic
organelles.

It has been accepted for a hundred years or more that rods and cones are the only
photoreceptive cells in the retina. The light signals generated in rods and
cones, after processing by downstream retinal neurons (bipolar, horizontal,
amacrine and ganglion cells), are transmitted to the brain via the axons of the
ganglion cells for further analysis. In the past few years, however, convincing
evidence has rapidly emerged indicating that a small subset of retinal ganglion
cells in mammals is also intrinsically photosensitive. Melanopsin is the
signaling photopigment in these cells. The main function of the inner-retina
photoreceptors is to generate and transmit non-image-forming visual information, 
although some role in conventional vision (image detection) is also possible.

Increasingly systematic approaches to quantifying receptive fields in primary
visual cortex, combined with inspired ideas about functional circuitry,
non-linearities, and visual stimuli, are bringing new interest to classical
problems. This includes the distinction and hierarchy between simple and complex 
cells, the mechanisms underlying the receptive field surround, and debates about 
optimal stimuli for mapping receptive fields. An important new problem arises
from recent observations of stimulus-dependent spatial and temporal summation in 
primary visual cortex. It appears that the receptive field can no longer be
considered unique, and we might have to relinquish this cherished notion as the
embodiment of neuronal function in primary visual cortex.

Mechanoreceptor cells of the somatosensory system initiate the perception of
touch and pain. Molecules required for mechanosensation have been identified from
invertebrate neurons, and recent functional studies indicate that ion channels of
the transient receptor potential and degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel families
are likely to be transduction channels. The expression of related channels in
mammalian somatosensory neurons has fueled the notion that these channels mediate
mechanotransduction in vertebrates; however, genetic disruption and heterologous 
expression have not yet revealed a direct role for any of these candidates in
somatosensory mechanotransduction. Thus, new systems are needed to define the
function of these ion channels in somatosensation and to pinpoint molecules or
signaling pathways that underlie mechanotransduction in vertebrates.

Since the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques, studies have been carried out
to examine nociceptive processing within the human brain non-invasively. Combined
with advances in immunohistochemistry, histology and genetics, we have been able 
to correlate more objective measures of nociceptive processing with the
subjective experience that is pain. The result has produced a dramatic shift in
our thinking about the neural circuitry involved in nociceptive processing,
revealing that pain is much more than a submodality of the sense of touch.

Neurobiologists have traditionally assumed that multisensory integration is a
higher order process that occurs after sensory signals have undergone extensive
processing through a hierarchy of unisensory subcortical and cortical regions.
Recent findings, however, question this assumption. Studies in humans, nonhuman
primates and other species demonstrate multisensory convergence in low level
cortical structures that were generally believed to be unisensory in function. In
addition to enriching current models of multisensory processing and perceptual
functions, these new findings require a revision in our thinking about unisensory
processing in low level cortical areas.

Recent reports have offered candidates for key components of the apparatus used
for mechanotransduction in hair cells. TRPA1 and cadherin 23 have been proposed
to be the transduction channel and component of the tip link, respectively;
moreover, ankyrin repeats in TRPA1 have been proposed to be the gating spring.
Although these are excellent candidates for the three components, definitive
experiments supporting each identification have yet to be performed.

Recent data on learning-related changes in animal and human auditory cortex
indicate functions beyond mere stimulus representation and simple recognition
memory for stimuli. Rather, auditory cortex seems to process and represent
stimuli in a task-dependent fashion. This implies plasticity in neural
processing, which can be observed at the level of single neuron firing and the
level of spatiotemporal activity patterns in cortical areas. Auditory cortex is a
structure in which behaviorally relevant aspects of stimulus processing are
highly developed because of the fugitive nature of auditory stimuli.

The cochlear implant arguably is the most successful neural prosthesis. Studies
of the responses of the central auditory system to prosthetic electrical
stimulation of the cochlea are revealing the success with which electrical
stimulation of a deaf ear can mimic acoustic stimulation of a normal-hearing ear.
Understanding of the physiology of central auditory structures can lead to
improved restoration of hearing with cochlear implants. In turn, the cochlear
implant can be exploited as an experimental tool for examining central hearing
mechanisms isolated from the effects of cochlear mechanics and transduction.

Insect chemoreception is mediated by a large and diverse superfamily of
seven-transmembrane domain receptors. These receptors were first identified in
Drosophila, but have since been found in other insects, including mosquitoes and 
moths. Expression and functional analysis of these receptors have been used to
identify receptor ligands and to map receptors to functional classes of neurons. 
Many receptors detect general odorants or tastants, whereas some detect
pheromones. The non-canonical receptor Or83b, which is highly conserved across
insect orders, dimerizes with odorant and pheromone receptors and is required for
efficient localization of these proteins to dendrites of sensory neurons. These
studies provide a foundation for understanding the molecular and cellular basis
of olfactory and gustatory coding.

Because bacterial mechanosensitive channels have been cloned, purified,
crystallized and subjected to a genetic, biochemical and physical scrutiny, they 
have become the current structural models of mechanosensation to atomic detail.
The key observation, supported by recent mutagenesis studies, is that these
channels receive stretch force directly through the lipid bilayer at the
interface levels bearing highest tension. Indeed, simulations of mechanosensitive
channels steered by strategically applied bilayer stretch forces show channel
opening. Our understanding of the gating energetics and trajectory are
continually being refined by the combination of approaches applied. In addition, 
new microbial mechanosensitive channels from the TRP family have been
characterized in yeasts. Unified by fundamental biophysical principles of gating,
mechanosensitive channels provide broad insight into protein-membrane
interactions and the role of hydrophobic hydration in gating.

Recent advances have brought new insight into the physiological mechanisms that
enable birds and other animals to use magnetic fields for orientation. Many birds
seem to have two magnetodetection senses, one based on magnetite near the beak
and one based on light-dependent radical-pair processes in the bird's eye(s).
Among the most exciting recent results are: first, behavioural responses of birds
experiencing oscillating magnetic fields. Second, the occurrence of putative
magnetosensory molecules, the cryptochromes, in the eyes of migratory birds.
Third, detection of a brain area that integrates specialised visual input at
night in night-migratory songbirds. Fourth, a putative magnetosensory cluster of 
magnetite in the upper beak. These and other recent findings have important
implications for magnetoreception; however, many crucial open questions remain.

Recent progress in our understanding of the trafficking of potassium channels can
be seen in particular when considering the Kv-type channels. To date, we have
discovered that folding of the Kv1.3 T1 domain begins in the ribosomal exit
tunnel, and that the cell surface expression of Kv4 channels is enhanced by the
presence of two recently identified accessory subunits. Current advances are
beginning to enable us to understand the Kv supermolecular complex containing
these subunits in crystallographic detail. In addition, determinants that govern 
the dendritic or axonal targeting of Kv channels have also been identified. In
terms of the bigger picture, the careful analysis of gene expression patterns in 
the brain paves the way for studying trafficking in a physiological context.
Indeed, neuronal activity has recently been shown to fine-tune the localization
of Kv2.1 channels in microdomains of the neuronal plasma membrane.

The evolution of alternative splicing in eukaryotes greatly expanded the number
of functionally distinct proteins that could be produced from a finite gene pool.
Extensive in the brains of higher organisms, alternative splicing might be the
primary mechanism for generating the spectrum of protein activities that support 
complex brain functions. Alternative splicing is controlled at the level of
individual neurons to custom design proteins for optimal performance. The
expression profiles of splice isoforms are modified during development and as
neuronal activity changes. Alternative splicing can lead to incremental, long
lasting changes in ion channel and receptor activities, independent of changes in
gene transcription. Recent studies of tissue-specific splicing factors are
revealing how coordinated alterations in alternative splicing of RNA transcripts 
control synaptic function.

Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels link elevations of
intracellular calcium ions to membrane potential, exerting a hyperpolarizing
influence when activated. The consequences of SK channel activity have been
revealed by the specific blocker apamin, a peptide toxin from honeybee venom.
Recent studies have revealed unexpected roles for SK channels in fine-tuning
intrinsic cell firing properties and in responsiveness to synaptic input. They
have also identified specific roles for different SK channel subtypes. A host of 
Ca2+ sources, including distinct subtypes of voltage-dependent calcium channels, 
intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+-permeable ionotropic neurotransmitter
receptors, activate SK channels. The macromolecular complex in which the Ca2+
source, SK channels and various modulators are assembled determines the kinetics 
and consequences of SK channel activation.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is a signaling phospholipid of the plasma
membrane that has a dynamically changing concentration. In addition to being the 
precursor of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, it complexes with and
regulates many cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. Recent work has characterized
the regulation of a wide range of ion channels by phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, helping to redefine the role of this lipid in cells and in
neurobiology. In most cases, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate increases
channel activity, and its hydrolysis by phospholipase C reduces channel activity.

A decade since their discovery, the K2P channels are recognized as pathways
dedicated to regulated background leakage of potassium ions that serve to control
neuronal excitability. The recent identification of protein partners that
directly interact with K2P channels (SUMO, 14-3-3 and Vpu1) has exposed new
regulatory pathways. Reversible linkage to SUMO silences K2P1 plasma membrane
channels; phosphorylation of K2P3 enables 14-3-3 binding to affect forward
trafficking, whereas it decreases open probability of K2P2; and, Vpu1, an HIV
encoded partner, mediates assembly-dependent degradation of K2P3. An operational 
strategy has emerged: tonic inhibition of K2P channels allows baseline neuronal
activity until enhanced potassium leak is required to suppress excitability.

X-ray crystallography was used to solve the atomic structure of the ligand
binding domain of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type1 homo-dimer, making it
possible to show the conformational change of this domain upon glutamate binding.
Studies of dimeric metabotropic receptors thereafter have focused on the
respective roles and interaction of the two subunits, on the activation
mechanisms following the structural rearrangements of the ligand-binding domain, 
and on the functional significance of polyvalent cations, the binding of which
was identified in the crystal. The direct interaction between the GABA(B)
receptor and the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) has also attracted
attention. Recently, attention has focused on incorporating these structural
features into a functional view of the receptors.

Channels of the TRP superfamily have sensory roles in a wide variety of receptor 
cells, especially in mechanosensation. In some cases, the channels appear to be
directly activated by mechanical force; in others, they appear to be downstream
of a messenger pathway initiated by force on a non-channel sensor. A remaining
challenge for most of these mechanosensory TRPs is to clarify the specific
mechanism of activation.

The various properties of neuronal dendrites--their morphology, active membrane
and synaptic properties--all play important roles in determining the functional
capabilities of central nervous system neurons. Because of their fundamental
involvement in both synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity, the active
dendritic properties are important for both neuronal information processing and
storage. The active properties of dendrites are determined by the densities of
voltage-gated ion channels located within the dendrites in addition to the
biophysical characteristics of those channels. The real power of this system
resides in the level of plasticity that is provided by the many forms of channel 
modulation known to exist in neurons. Indeed, voltage gated ion channel
modulation shapes the active properties of neuronal dendrites to specific
conditions, thus tailoring the functional role of the single neuron within its
circuit.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are found in several cell types, and are
best studied in photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons. There, CNG channels
are gated by the second messengers of the visual and olfactory signalling
cascades, cGMP and cAMP respectively, and operate as transduction channels
generating the stimulus-induced receptor potentials. In visual and olfactory
sensory cells CNG channels conduct cationic currents. Calcium can contribute a
large fraction of this current, and calcium influx serves a modulatory role in
CNG-channel mediated signal transduction. There have been recent developments in 
our understanding of how the regulation of CNG channels contributes to the
physiological properties of photoreceptors and olfactory sensory cells, and in
particular on the role of calcium-mediated feedback.

In the past few years several spontaneous or engineered mouse models with
mutations in Ca2+ channel genes have become available, providing a powerful
approach to defining Ca2+ channel function in vivo. There have been recent
advances in outlining the phenotypes and in the functional analysis of mouse
models with mutations in genes encoding the pore-forming subunits of Ca(V)2.1
(P/Q-type), Ca(V)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(V)2.3 (R-type) Ca2+ channels, the channels
involved in controlling neurotransmitter release at mammalian synapses. These
data indicate that Ca(V)2.1 channels have a dominant and efficient specific role 
in initiating fast synaptic transmission at central excitatory synapses in vivo, 
and suggest that the Ca(V)2.1 channelopathies are primarily synaptic diseases.
The different disorders probably arise from disruption of neurotransmission in
specific brain regions: the cortex in the case of migraine, the thalamus in the
case of absence epilepsy and the cerebellum in the case of ataxia.

Following the gradual recognition of the importance of intracellular calcium
stores for somatodendritic signaling in the mammalian brain, recent reports have 
also indicated a significant role of presynaptic calcium stores.
Ryanodine-sensitive stores generate local, random calcium signals that shape
spontaneous transmitter release. They amplify spike-driven calcium signals in
presynaptic terminals, and consequently enhance the efficacy of transmitter
release. They appear to be recruited by an association with certain types of
calcium-permeant ion channels, and they induce specific forms of synaptic
plasticity. Recent research also indicates a role of
inositoltrisphosphate-sensitive presynaptic calcium stores in synaptic
plasticity.

Glutamate receptor ion channels mediate excitatory responses at the majority of
CNS synapses. They are the only ligand-gated ion channels for which multiple
high-resolution crystal structures have been solved. Highlights of information
gained from mechanistic studies based on the crystal structures of their
ligand-binding domains include explanations for strikingly diverse phenomena.
These include the basis for subtype-specific agonist selectivity; mechanisms for 
desensitization and allosteric modulation; and mechanisms for partial agonist
activity. In addition, multiple lines of evidence, including low-resolution
electron microscopic studies, suggest that native AMPA receptors combine with an 
auxiliary subunit which regulates activity and trafficking. Functional studies
suggest that glutamate receptor gating is distinct from that of structurally
related voltage-gated ion channels.

Vesicle fusion and transmitter release at synapses is driven by a highly
localized Ca2+ signal that rapidly builds up around open Ca2+-channels at and
near presynaptic active zones. It has been difficult to estimate the amplitude
and the kinetics of this 'microdomain' signal by direct Ca2+-imaging approaches. 
Recently, Ca2+ uncaging at large CNS synapses, among them the calyx of Held, has 
shown that the intrinsic cooperativity of Ca2+ in inducing vesicle fusion is
high, with 4-5 Ca2+ ions needed to trigger vesicle fusion. Given the
Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion as determined by Ca2+-uncaging, it was found
that a surprisingly small (10-25 microM) and brief (<1 ms) local Ca2+ signal is
sufficient to achieve the amount, and the kinetics of the physiological
transmitter release. The high cooperativity of Ca2+ in inducing vesicle fusion
and the non-saturation of the Ca2+-sensor for vesicle fusion renders small
changes of the local Ca2+-signal highly effective in changing the release
probability; an insight that is important for our understanding of short-term
modulation of synaptic strength.

Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters for monoamines, GABA, glycine and
excitatory amino acids are homologous to two sizable families of bacterial amino 
acid transporters. Recently, a high resolution structure was determined for a
thermophilic glutamate transporter. Also, a bacterial tryptophan transporter
related to the family of biogenic amine neurotransmitter transporters was
functionally expressed. Structural insights from these and other bacterial
transporters will help to rationalize the mechanisms for the increasingly complex
functions that have been described for mammalian transporters, in addition to
their modes of regulation. We touch on recent insights into the functions of
neurotransmitter transporters in their physiological contexts.

Autonomous pacemakers are crucial elements in many neural circuits. This is
particularly true for the basal ganglia. This richly interconnected group of
nuclei is rife with both fast- and slow-spiking pacemakers. Our understanding of 
the ionic mechanisms underlying pacemaking in these neurons is rapidly evolving, 
yielding new insights into the normal functioning of this network and how it goes
awry in pathological states such as Parkinson's disease.

CLC proteins are found in cells from prokaryotes to mammals and perform functions
in plasma membranes and intracellular vesicles. Several genetic human diseases
and mouse models underscore their broad physiological functions in mammals. These
functions range from the control of excitability to transepithelial transport,
endocytotic trafficking and acidification of synaptic vesicles. The recent
crystallization of bacterial CLC proteins gave surprising insights into CLC
Cl(-)-channel permeation and gating and provides an excellent basis for
structure-function studies. Surprisingly, the CLC from Escherichia coli functions
as a Cl-/H+ exchanger, thus demonstrating the thin line separating transporters
and channels.

New discoveries challenge the long-held view that aging is characterized by
progressive loss and decline. Evidence for functional reorganization,
compensation and effective interventions holds promise for a more optimistic view
of neurocognitive status in later life. Complexities associated with assigning
function to age-specific activation patterns must be considered relative to
performance and in light of pathological aging. New biological and genetic
markers, coupled with advances in imaging technologies, are enabling more precise
characterization of healthy aging. This interdisciplinary, cognitive neuroscience
approach reveals dynamic and optimizing processes in aging that might be
harnessed to foster the successful aging of the mind.

It has been just under a decade since contemporary neuroimaging tools, such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging, were first applied to developmental
questions. These tools provide invaluable information on how brain anatomy,
function and connectivity change during development. Studies using these methods 
with children and adolescents show that brain regions that support motor and
sensory function mature earliest, whereas higher-order association areas, such as
the prefrontal cortex, which integrate these functions, mature later.

Recent functional neuroimaging studies are generating novel insights into our
knowledge of skilled and disturbed reading. In neurologically normal subjects, a 
double dissociation in neural activation in response to reading words and
pseudowords has been revealed that corresponds to that observed in the comparison
of semantic and phonological tasks. In patients with acquired dyslexia,
functional imaging is demonstrating re-organisation within the reading system; in
developmental dyslexia, functional imaging is being used to identify the impact
of rehabilitation. Together, these findings have implications for cognitive
models of reading that have previously relied on input from behavioural data.

Why the frontal cortex in autism might be talking only to itself: local

Although it has long been thought that frontal lobe abnormality must play an
important part in generating the severe impairment in higher-order social,
emotional and cognitive functions in autism, only recently have studies
identified developmentally early frontal lobe defects. At the microscopic level, 
neuroinflammatory reactions involving glial activation, migration defects and
excess cerebral neurogenesis and/or defective apoptosis might generate frontal
neural pathology early in development. It is hypothesized that these abnormal
processes cause malformation and thus malfunction of frontal minicolumn
microcircuitry. It is suggested that connectivity within frontal lobe is
excessive, disorganized and inadequately selective, whereas connectivity between 
frontal cortex and other systems is poorly synchronized, weakly responsive and
information impoverished. Increased local but reduced long-distance
cortical-cortical reciprocal activity and coupling would impair the fundamental
frontal function of integrating information from widespread and diverse systems
and providing complex context-rich feedback, guidance and control to lower-level 
systems.

Results of neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies of frontal lobe function
have been interpreted by some as evidence for specialized modules that are
localized to distinct regions of frontal cortex, and that differ in both content 
and process from those in neighboring regions. These descriptions stand in stark 
contrast to the many domain-general theoretical accounts of the regulatory role
of the frontal lobes in cognition. Recent attempts to understand how general
regulatory mechanisms might operate across multiple domains (e.g. working memory,
sentence comprehension) have been increasingly important in our understanding of 
the frontal lobes.

Neuroscience research during the past ten years has fundamentally changed the
traditional view of the motor system. In monkeys, the finding that premotor
neurons also discharge during visual stimulation (visuomotor neurons) raises new 
hypotheses about the putative role played by motor representations in perceptual 
functions. Among visuomotor neurons, mirror neurons might be involved in
understanding the actions of others and might, therefore, be crucial in
interindividual communication. Functional brain imaging studies enabled us to
localize the human mirror system, but the demonstration that the motor cortex
dynamically replicates the observed actions, as if they were executed by the
observer, can only be given by fast and focal measurements of cortical activity. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation enables us to instantaneously estimate
corticospinal excitability, and has been used to study the human mirror system at
work during the perception of actions performed by other individuals. In the past
ten years several TMS experiments have been performed investigating the
involvement of motor system during others' action observation. Results suggest
that when we observe another individual acting we strongly 'resonate' with his or
her action. In other words, our motor system simulates underthreshold the
observed action in a strictly congruent fashion. The involved muscles are the
same as those used in the observed action and their activation is temporally
strictly coupled with the dynamics of the observed action.

Neural substrates of processing syntax and semantics in music.

Koelsch S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Junior Research Group Neurocognition of Music, Max Planck Institute for Human 
Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. koelsch@cbs.mpg.de

Growing evidence indicates that syntax and semantics are basic aspects of music. 
After the onset of a chord, initial music-syntactic processing can be observed at
about 150-400 ms and processing of musical semantics at about 300-500 ms.
Processing of musical syntax activates inferior frontolateral cortex,
ventrolateral premotor cortex and presumably the anterior part of the superior
temporal gyrus. These brain structures have been implicated in sequencing of
complex auditory information, identification of structural relationships, and
serial prediction. Processing of musical semantics appears to activate posterior 
temporal regions. The processes and brain structures involved in the perception
of syntax and semantics in music have considerable overlap with those involved in
language perception, underlining intimate links between music and language in the
human brain.

Fundamental breakthroughs in the neurosciences, combined with technical
innovations for measuring brain activity, are shedding new light on the neural
basis of second language (L2) processing, and on its relationship to native
language processing (L1). The long-held assumption that L1 and L2 are necessarily
represented in different brain regions in bilinguals has not been confirmed. On
the contrary, the available evidence indicates that L1 and L2 are processed by
the same neural devices. The neural differences in L1 and L2 representations are 
only related to the specific computational demands, which vary according to the
age of acquisition, the degree of mastery and the level of exposure to each
language. Finally, the acquisition of L2 could be considered as a dynamic
process, requiring additional neural resources in specific circumstances.

There have been recent developments in our understanding of the auditory
neuroscience of non-human primates that, to a certain extent, can be integrated
with findings from human functional neuroimaging studies. This framework can be

In the past few years, important contributions have been made to the study of
emotional visual perception. Researchers have reported responses to emotional
stimuli in the human amygdala under some unattended conditions (i.e. conditions
in which the focus of attention was diverted away from the stimuli due to task
instructions), during visual masking and during binocular suppression. Taken
together, these results reveal the relative degree of autonomy of emotional
processing. At the same time, however, important limitations to the notion of
complete automaticity have been revealed. Effects of task context and attention
have been shown, as well as large inter-subject differences in sensitivity to the
detection of masked fearful faces (whereby briefly presented, target fearful
faces are immediately followed by a neutral face that 'masks' the initial face). 
A better understanding of the neural basis of emotional perception and how it
relates to visual attention and awareness is likely to require further refinement
of the concepts of automaticity and awareness.

Visual attention operates by biasing competitive interactions between neural
representations, favoring relevant over irrelevant visual inputs. Attention can
enhance the processing of relevant information using location-based,
feature-based or object-based selection mechanisms. Studies using event-related
potential and event-related magnetic field recordings, together with functional
magnetic resonance imaging, show that the temporal sequencing of these different 
selection mechanisms is flexible. Depending on the specific processing demands of
the experimental task, location-based, feature-based or object-based selection
might be given temporal priority on a time scale of tens of milliseconds.

Human and nonhuman primates have a remarkable ability to recall, maintain and
manipulate visual images in the absence of external sensory stimulation. Evidence
from lesion, single-unit neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies shows that
these visual working memory processes are consistently associated with sustained 
activity in object-selective inferior temporal neurons. Furthermore, results from
these studies suggest that mnemonic activity in the inferior temporal cortex is, 
in turn, supported by top-down inputs from multimodal regions in prefrontal and
medial temporal cortex, and under some circumstances, from the hippocampus.

Recent evidence suggests that in primates, as in rodents, the hippocampus shows a
developmental continuum that affects memory abilities from infancy to adulthood. 
In primates relatively few hippocampal-dependent abilities (e.g. some aspects of 
recognition memory) are present in early infancy, whereas others (e.g. relational
memory) begin to show adult-like characteristics around 2 years of age in monkeys
and 5-7 years in humans. Profound and persistent memory loss resulting from
insult to the hippocampus in infancy becomes evident in everyday behavior only
later in childhood. This pattern of results suggests a maturational gradient
within the medial temporal lobe memory system, with most abilities crucially
dependent upon the hippocampus emerging in later stages of development,
supporting a model of hierarchical organization of memory within the medial
temporal lobe.

On the basis of brain imaging studies, Doyon and Ungerleider recently proposed a 
model describing the cerebral plasticity that occurs in both cortico-striatal and
cortico-cerebellar systems of the adult brain during learning of new motor
skilled behaviors. This theoretical framework makes several testable predictions 
with regards to the contribution of these neural systems based on the phase
(fast, slow, consolidation, automatization, and retention) and nature of the
motor learning processes (motor sequence versus motor adaptation) acquired
through repeated practice. There has been recent behavioral, lesion and
additional neuroimaging studies that have addressed the assumptions made in this 
theory that will help in the revision of this model.

Perceptual learning improves performance on many tasks, from orientation
discrimination to the identification of faces. Although conventional wisdom
considered sensory cortices as hard-wired, the specificity of improvement
achieved through perceptual learning indicates an involvement of early sensory
cortices. These cortices might be more plastic than previously assumed, and both 
sum-potential and single cell recordings indeed demonstrate plasticity of
neuronal responses of these sensory cortices. However, for learning to be
optimally useful, it must generalize to other tasks. Further research on
perceptual learning should therefore, in my opinion, investigate first, the
conditions for generalization of training-induced improvement, second, its use
for teaching and rehabilitation, and third, its dependence on pharmacological
agents.

Our understanding of multisensory integration has advanced because of recent
functional neuroimaging studies of three areas in human lateral occipito-temporal
cortex: superior temporal sulcus, area LO and area MT (V5). Superior temporal
sulcus is activated strongly in response to meaningful auditory and visual
stimuli, but responses to tactile stimuli have not been well studied. Area LO
shows strong activation in response to both visual and tactile shape information,
but not to auditory representations of objects. Area MT, an important region for 
processing visual motion, also shows weak activation in response to tactile
motion, and a signal that drops below resting baseline in response to auditory
motion. Within superior temporal sulcus, a patchy organization of regions is
activated in response to auditory, visual and multisensory stimuli. This
organization appears similar to that observed in polysensory areas in macaque
superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that it is an anatomical substrate for
multisensory integration. A patchy organization might also be a neural mechanism 
for integrating disparate representations within individual sensory modalities,
such as representations of visual form and visual motion.

Different primate species, including humans, have evolved by a repeated branching
of lineages, some of which have become extinct. The problem of determining the
relationships among cortical areas within the brains of the surviving branches
(e.g. humans, macaque monkeys, owl monkeys) is difficult for several reasons.
First, evolutionary intermediates are missing, second, measurement techniques are
different in different primate species, third, species differ in body size, and
fourth, brain areas can duplicate, fuse, or reorganize between and within
lineages.

Adult neurogenesis occurs in most species and is regulated by a wide variety of
environmental and pharmacological challenges. The functional integration of
neurons generated in the adult was first demonstrated in songbirds more than two 
decades ago. In the adult mammalian brain, neurons are continuously generated in 
two structures, the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. Current evidence suggests
that adult-born immature neurons have distinct electrophysiological properties

Proteoglycans are of two main types, chondroitin sulfate (CSPGs) and heparin
sulfate (HSPGs). The CSPGs act mainly as barrier-forming molecules, whereas the
HSPGs stabilise the interactions of receptors and ligands. During development
CSPGs pattern cell migration, axon growth pathways and axon terminations. Later
in development and in adulthood CSPGs associate with some classes of neuron and
control plasticity. After damage to the nervous system, CSPGs are the major axon 
growth inhibitory component of the glial scar tissue that blocks successful
regeneration. CSPGs have a variety of roles in the nervous system, including
binding to molecules and blocking their action, presenting molecules to cells and
axons, localising active molecules to particular sites and presenting growth
factors to their receptors.

Blood vessels and nerves are structurally similar complex branched systems. Their
guidance must be exquisitely regulated to ensure proper wiring of both networks. 
Recent results showed that specialized endothelial cells, resembling axonal
growth cones, form the tips of growing capillaries. These endothelial tip cells
guide outgrowing capillaries in response to gradients of extracellular
matrix-bound vascular endothelial growth factor. Several axon guidance molecules,
including Semaphorins, Netrins, Ephrins and Slits, have also been implicated in
vessel pathfinding and network formation. In particular, Semaphorin3E and its
receptor plexinD1 in addition to the Netrin receptor UNC5B have recently been
shown to direct endothelial tip cell navigation.

Cell corpses generated during CNS development are eliminated through phagocytosis
performed by a variety of cells, including mesenchyme-derived macrophages and
microglia, or glial cells originating in the neurogenic ectoderm. Mounting
evidence indicates that in different species, phagocytes not only clear cell
corpses but also engulf still-living neural cells or axons, and thereby promote
cell death or axon pruning. Knowledge of the mechanisms of corpse recognition by 
engulfing cells provides molecular signals to this new role for phagocytes. These
observations support a conserved and instructive role for phagocytosis in the
execution of regressive events during neurogenesis.

One of the seminal discoveries in developmental neuroscience is that altering
visual experience through monocular deprivation can alter both the physiological 
and the anatomical representation of the two eyes, called ocular dominance
columns, in primary visual cortex. This rearrangement is restricted to a critical
period that starts a few days or weeks after vision is established and ends
before adulthood. In contrast to the original hypothesis proposed by Hubel and
Wiesel, ocular dominance columns are already substantially formed before the
onset of the critical period. Indeed, before the critical period there is a
period of ocular dominance column formation during which there is robust
spontaneous activity and visual experience. Recent findings raise important
questions about whether activity guides ocular dominance column formation in this
'precritical period'. One developmental event that marks the passage from the
precritical period to the critical period is the activation of a GABAergic
circuit. How these events trigger the transition from the precritical to critical
period is not known.

The networks that generate rhythmic motor patterns in invertebrates and
vertebrates are ideal for studying the mechanisms by which functional circuits
are formed during development. Rhythmic motor patterns and movements are seen
embryonically, before they are needed for behavior; recent work suggests that
activity in immature spinal cord networks is important for circuit formation and 
transmitter specification. Despite significant advances in describing the
patterns of transcription factor expression in both invertebrate nervous systems 
and vertebrate spinal cord, a real understanding of how central pattern
generators develop is hindered by our lack of knowledge of the organization of
these circuits in adults.

The hormones that regulate the hypothalamic circuits that control essential
functions, such as reproduction and energy homeostasis, also specify brain
architecture by regulating key developmental events. The cellular mechanisms
underlying the developmental actions of testosterone and estrogen to determine
patterns of neuronal cell death, synaptogenesis and axon guidance are being
identified. Recent neuroanatomical evidence indicates that the adipocyte-derived 
hormone leptin may direct the development of hypothalamic pathways involved in
energy homeostasis by promoting axonal projections from the arcuate nucleus of
the hypothalamus to other hypothalamic sites that mediate the effects of leptin
on food intake and body weight. Understanding how sex steroids and leptin
regulate hypothalamic development will enable us to identify hormonally directed 
signaling events essential to the specification of neural circuitry that is
optimized for sustained homeostasis.

Cadherin-catenin complexes have been well established as key regulators of cell
adhesion. Recent work has elucidated a pivotal role for these molecules in
synaptic assembly, remodelling and plasticity. Far from being mere adhesive
scaffolds, cadherins might directly regulate cell signalling to modulate synaptic
connectivity.

Dendritic spines, which are present at the vast majority of excitatory synapses
in the central nervous system, have a specialized cytoskeleton of dynamic actin
filaments that makes them capable of rapid morphological plasticity. During
development, structural remodeling of nascent spines is an important factor in
experience-dependent shaping of neuronal circuits, whereas in the adult brain
spines maintain a balance between morphological stability and plasticity.

Axon branching is vital to the development of a highly interconnected and
functional nervous system. Similar to axon growth and guidance, axon branching is
subject to dynamic remodeling of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Coordinated
remodeling of the cytoskeleton is achieved through parallel and direct targeting 
of both actin filaments and a subset of highly dynamic microtubules that probe
the actin-rich peripheral domains in growth cones and emerging branch sites. A
growing number of extracellular cues implicated in growth cone guidance also
influence axon branch behavior. Mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of
growth cone steering and axon branching reveals significant similarities but also
uncovers important differences between these crucial events in the establishment 
of neural circuits.

During neuronal development, neurotrophins are essential factors that promote
survival, differentiation and myelination of neurons. The trophic signals are
relayed to the cells via binding to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75
neurotrophin receptor. Paradoxically, the p75 neurotrophin receptor also ensures 
rapid and appropriate apoptosis of neonatal neurons not reaching their proper
targets and transmits death signals to injured neurons. Until recently, the
mechanisms by which the p75 neurotrophin receptor governs these opposing
functions have remained elusive. By the identification of new ligands and
cytosolic interacting partners, receptor cleavage products and coreceptors, some 
of these mechanisms are now being unraveled. Here, we review recent progress in
delineating the molecular networks that enable p75(NTR) to dictate life and
death.

The retrograde communication of neurotrophic signals from axon terminals to
neuron cell bodies is crucial for neuron survival and plasticity. Several
mechanisms have been proposed in the past, but recent evidence strongly supports 
the hypothesis that the retrograde propagation of self-regenerating signaling
organelles, derived from the endocytosis of activated neurotrophin-bound receptor
tyrosine kinases, is the primary mechanism responsible for this long-distance
communication.

In all complex organisms, glial cells are pivotal for neuronal development and
function. Insects are characterized by having only a small number of these cells,
which nevertheless display a remarkable molecular diversity. An intricate
relationship between neurons and glia is initially required for glial migration
and during axonal patterning. Recent data suggest that in organisms such as
Drosophila, a prime role of glial cells lies in setting boundaries to guide and
constrain axonal growth.

Cells with radial morphology in the developing brain were first identified more
than 100 years ago. These cells, later termed radial glia, have been studied
primarily as migratory scaffolds and glial progenitors. However, it has become
increasingly clear, on the basis of in vitro studies and more recent in vivo fate
mapping experiments, that radial glia also generate neurons during embryonic
development. Now the challenge will be to understand the signaling events that
regulate the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these cells and their
developmental potential. Recent work has identified the Notch, ErbB, and
fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways as central to the regulation of
radial 'glial' progenitors.

Cognitive development is determined by both genetics and environment. One point
of convergence of these two influences is the neural activity-dependent
regulation of programs of gene expression that specify neuronal fate and
function. Human genetic studies have linked several transcriptional regulators to
neurodevelopmental disorders including mental retardation and autism spectrum
disorders. Recent reports on two such factors, CREB-binding protein and
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, have begun to reveal how epigenetics and neuronal
activity act to modulate the program of gene expression required for synaptic
development and function.

Neurobiologists have long sought to understand how circuits in the nervous system
are organized to generate the precise neural outputs that underlie particular
behaviors. Given the complexity of the nervous system in higher vertebrates this

out hope that studies of locomotor and respiratory circuits will provide general 
insight for understanding how ensembles of neurons are wired to control specific 
behaviors.

Resident among the highly structured adult nervous system, a few cells, referred 
to as neural progenitors or stem cells, maintain the ability to self-renew or
differentiate. From the time of their specification during neural induction and
throughout the building of the nervous system, neural progenitor cells preserve
their broad developmental potential and replicative capacity to be able to
produce the vast array of neuronal and glial cell types of the mature nervous
system as, and when, required. Recently, considerable attention has been focused 
on identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for maintaining neural
progenitor or stem cell fate throughout ontogeny. The expression of a subset of
SOX transcription factors is initiated concomitant with the acquisition of neural
progenitor identity and is then maintained in the entire progenitor population of
the developing and adult nervous system. Strikingly, studies in the central and
peripheral nervous system of chick and mouse have revealed that SOX factors are
key regulators of neural progenitor identity, promoting self-renewal in a
context-dependent manner by sustaining the undifferentiated state of progenitor
cells and maintaining their ability to either proliferate or differentiate.

Human cooperation represents a spectacular outlier in the animal world. Unlike
other creatures, humans frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated
strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and
when reputation gains are small or absent. Experimental evidence and evolutionary
models suggest that strong reciprocity, the behavioral propensity for altruistic 
punishment and altruistic rewarding, is of key importance for human cooperation. 
Here, we review both evidence documenting altruistic punishment and altruistic
cooperation and recent brain imaging studies that combine the powerful tools of
behavioral game theory with neuroimaging techniques. These studies show that
mutual cooperation and the punishment of defectors activate reward related neural
circuits, suggesting that evolution has endowed humans with proximate mechanisms 
that render altruistic behavior psychologically rewarding.

Understanding the neurobiology of social behaviour in mammals has been
considerably advanced by the findings from two species of vole, one of which is
monogamous and pair bonds whereas the other species is promiscuous and fails to
form any long-lasting social relationships. The combination of neurobehavioural
studies and molecular genetics has determined behavioural differences between the
two species linked to the neural distribution of vasopressin 1A receptor in the
male brain. More importantly, vasopressin 1A receptor gene transfer including the
upstream regulatory sequence has enhanced male social affiliation in a
non-monogamous species. Male affiliative bonding depends upon release of both
vasopressin and dopamine in the ventral striatum enhancing the reward value of
odour cues that signal identity.

This review outlines recent findings from human neuroimaging concerning the role 
of a highly interconnected network of brain areas including orbital and medial
prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum and dopaminergic mid-brain in reward
processing. Distinct reward-related functions can be attributed to different
components of this network. Orbitofrontal cortex is involved in coding stimulus
reward value and in concert with the amygdala and ventral striatum is implicated 
in representing predicted future reward. Such representations can be used to
guide action selection for reward, a process that depends, at least in part, on
orbital and medial prefrontal cortex as well as dorsal striatum.

An understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction requires
examination of real-time (subsecond) cellular and chemical responses in the brain
reward system during drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. Electrophysiological 
and electrochemical studies in the rodent nucleus accumbens have examined changes
in cell firing and rapid dopamine signaling during crucial periods of behavioral 
responding for drugs, and show the associative nature of those signals. These
findings are considered with respect to the functional microcircuitry in the
nucleus accumbens that underlies goal-directed behavior and the role of this
circuit in drug addiction.

Work in cortically controlled neuroprosthetic systems has concentrated on
decoding natural behaviors from neural activity, with the idea that if the
behavior could be fully decoded it could be duplicated using an artificial
system. Initial estimates from this approach suggested that a high-fidelity
signal comprised of many hundreds of neurons would be required to control a
neuroprosthetic system successfully. However, recent studies are showing hints
that these systems can be controlled effectively using only a few tens of
neurons. Attempting to decode the pre-existing relationship between neural
activity and natural behavior is not nearly as important as choosing a decoding
scheme that can be more readily deployed and trained to generate the desired
actions of the artificial system. These artificial systems need not resemble or
behave similarly to any natural biological system. Effective matching of discrete
and continuous neural command signals to appropriately configured device
functions will enable effective control of both natural and abstract artificial
systems using compatible thought processes.

The robust nature of vocal communication in frogs has long attracted the
attention of natural philosophers and their biologically inclined successors.
Each frog species produces distinctive calls that facilitate pre-mating
reproductive isolation and thus speciation. In many terrestrial species, a chorus
of simultaneously calling males attracts females to breeding sites; reproductive 
females then choose and locate one male, using distinctive acoustic cues. Males
compete with each other vocally and sometimes physically as well. Anuran acoustic
signaling systems are thus subject to the strong pressures of sexual selection.
We are beginning to understand the ways in which vocal signals are produced and
decoded by the nervous system and the roles of neurally active hormones in both
processes.

Is it possible to localize a memory trace to a subset of cells in the brain? If
so, it should be possible to show: first, that neuronal plasticity occurs in
these cells. Second, that neuronal plasticity in these cells is sufficient for
memory. Third, that neuronal plasticity in these cells is necessary for memory.
Fourth, that memory is abolished if these cells cannot provide output during
testing. And fifth, that memory is abolished if these cells cannot receive input 
during training. With regard to olfactory learning in flies, we argue that the
notion of the olfactory memory trace being localized to the Kenyon cells of the
mushroom bodies is a reasonable working hypothesis.

Fruit flies alter flight direction by generating rapid stereotyped turns called
saccades. Using a combination of tethered and free-flight methods, both the
aerodynamic mechanisms and the sensory triggers for saccades have been
investigated. The results indicate that saccades are elicited by visual
expansion, and are brought about by remarkably subtle changes in wing motion.
Mechanosensory feedback from the fly's 'gyroscope' complements visual cues to
terminate saccades, as well as to stabilize forward flight. Olfactory stimuli
elicit tonic increases in wingbeat amplitude and frequency but do not alter the
time course or magnitude of visual reflexes.

Brain-machine interfaces are being developed to assist paralyzed patients by
enabling them to operate machines with recordings of their own neural activity.
Recent studies show that motor parameters, such as hand trajectory, and cognitive
parameters, such as the goal and predicted value of an action, can be decoded
from the recorded activity to provide control signals. Neural prosthetics that
use simultaneously a variety of cognitive and motor signals can maximize the
ability of patients to communicate and interact with the outside world. Although 
most studies have recorded electroencephalograms or spike activity, recent
research shows that local field potentials (LFPs) offer a promising additional
signal. The decode performances of LFPs and spike signals are comparable and,
because LFP recordings are more long lasting, they might help to increase the
lifetime of the prosthetics.

Brain imaging experiments identify plausible circuits involved in the genesis of 
the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Akinesia is linked to
hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area secondary to insufficient
thalamocortical facilitation. Overactivation in other areas such as the lateral
premotor and parietal cortex probably represents a compensatory mechanism.
Bradykinesia is associated with abnormal functioning within intrinsic basal
ganglia circuitry for scaling movements to appropriate magnitude. Parkinson's
disease tremor is localized to pontine- and mesencephalic-cerebellar-thalamic
circuits, with abnormalities of both dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission.
There is a need to understand the anatomic intersections where information is
shared across these circuits.

A convergence of advances in optical methods and a better understanding of the
genetics of development promise to revolutionize the study of neuronal circuits
and their links to behavior. One of the great challenges in systems neurobiology 
has been to monitor and perturb activity in populations of identified neurons in 
vivo. Recent work has begun to achieve this goal through a combination of modern 
imaging methods with genetic labeling and perturbation.

Our sensory systems are simultaneously activated as the result of our own actions
and changes in the external world. The ability to distinguish self-generated
sensory events from those that arise externally is thus essential for perceptual 
stability and accurate motor control. Recently, progress has been made towards
understanding how this distinction is made. It has been proposed that an internal
prediction of the consequences of our actions is compared to the actual sensory
input to cancel the resultant self-generated activation. Evidence in support of
this hypothesis has been obtained for early stages of sensory processing in the
vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems. These findings have implications
for the sensory-motor transformations that are needed to guide behavior.

The study of plasticity in the central nervous system is a major and very dynamic
neuroscience research field with enormous clinical potential. Considerable
advances in this field have been made during the past 10 years. It now appears
that most circuits in the brain and spinal cord show plasticity and that they can
be modified by experience. Knowledge of the mechanisms of plasticity in the
nervous system is therefore essential for the understanding of how the nervous
system is wired during development and how it adapts in response to changes in
the body and environment. Recent findings indicate that functional sensorimotor
modules probe the sensory signals from the body that are generated as a
consequence of module specific activity and use this sensory feedback to
calibrate the strength in its input-output connections. This experience-dependent
signal adapts the circuitry in the sensorimotor module to the body anatomy and
biomechanics.

University of New Jersey, 197 University Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07102, USA.

The firing of neostriatal spiny neurons in response to an excitatory input is
modulated and sculpted by a variety of factors. Neostriatal interneurons are
phenotypically diverse and have properties that enable them to specifically, but 
differentially, influence the activity of spiny neurons. Each of the three types 
of GABAergic interneurons produces a strong inhibitory postsynaptic potential in 
spiny neurons, the function of which is probably to influence the precise timing 
of action potential firing in either individual or ensembles of spiny neurons. By
contrast, the role of cholinergic interneurons is to modulate the sub- and
supra-threshold responses of spiny neurons to cortical and/or thalamic
excitation, particularly in reward-related activities. Both classes of
interneurons are important sites of action of neuromodulators in neostriatum, and
act in different but complementary ways to modify the activity of the spiny
projection neurons.

Persistent neural activity refers to a sustained change in action potential
discharge that long outlasts a stimulus. It is found in a diverse set of brain
regions and organisms and several in vitro systems, suggesting that it can be
considered a universal form of circuit dynamics that can be used as a mechanism
for short-term storage and accumulation of sensory or motor information. Both
single cell and network mechanisms are likely to co-operate in generating
persistent activity in many brain areas.

Rhythmically active neuronal networks give rise to rhythmic motor activities but 
also to seemingly non-rhythmic behaviors such as sleep, arousal, addiction,
memory and cognition. Many of these networks contain pacemaker neurons. The
ability of these neurons to generate bursts of activity intrinsically lies in
voltage- and time-dependent ion fluxes resulting from a dynamic interplay among
ion channels, second messenger pathways and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations,
and is influenced by neuromodulators and synaptic inputs. This complex intrinsic 
and extrinsic modulation of pacemaker activity exerts a dynamic effect on network
activity. The nonlinearity of bursting activity might enable pacemaker neurons to
facilitate the onset of excitatory states or to synchronize neuronal
ensembles--an interactive process that is intimately regulated by synaptic and
modulatory processes.

Genetic mosaic techniques provide a powerful tool for dissecting gene function in
the intricate genetic networks that underlie the formation and function of
nervous systems. For instance, it is possible to make individual cells or groups 
of cells homozygous for mutations of interest at specific points during an
organism's development. It is also possible to resolve lineage relationships and 
to characterize cellular morphology and connectivity. Current techniques for
creating genetically mosaic organisms incorporate improved controls over clone
induction, identification, and/or mosaic tissue characterization.

Increasingly sophisticated strategies for labeling cells in vivo are providing
unprecedented opportunities to study neurons in living animals. Transgenic
expression of genetically encoded reporters enables us to monitor changes in
neuronal activity in response to sensory stimuli, and the labeling of single
neurons with fluorescent proteins allows the dynamics of neuronal connectivity to
be observed in transgenic animals over periods ranging from minutes to months.
Advances in transient labeling techniques such as viral infection and
electroporation provide a rapid means by which to analyze neuronal gene function 
in vivo. These new approaches to labeling, manipulating and imaging neurons in
intact organisms are transforming the way in which the nervous system is studied.

The exploitation of green fluorescent protein-based biosensors promises to
revolutionize functional imaging of the nervous system. Various approaches have
created a multitude of reporters of neuronal activity and of activation of
biochemical signaling pathways. Although the number of different probes has
increased significantly, the critical step remains to bring these probes from the
cuvette through the imaging of single cells to the imaging of whole organisms in 
vivo. The recent development of new genetically encoded sensors and their
functional expression in model organisms are encouraging signs that the field is 
moving ahead in this direction.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate where the
neural implementation of specific cognitive processes occurs. The standard
approach uses linear convolution models that relate experimentally designed
inputs, through a haemodynamic response function, to observed blood oxygen level 
dependent (BOLD) signals. Such models are, however, blind to the causal
mechanisms that underlie observed BOLD responses. Recent developments have
focused on how BOLD responses are generated and include biophysical
input-state-output models with neural and haemodynamic state equations and models
of functional integration that explain local dynamics through interactions with
remote areas. Forward models with parameters at the neural level, such as dynamic
causal modelling, combine both approaches, modelling the whole causal chain from 
external stimuli, via induced neural dynamics, to observed BOLD responses.

The compact size, mechanical flexibility, and growing functionality of optical
fiber and fiber optic devices are enabling several new modalities for imaging the
mammalian nervous system in vivo. Fluorescence microendoscopy is a minimally
invasive fiber modality that provides cellular resolution in deep brain areas.
Diffuse optical tomography is a non-invasive modality that uses assemblies of
fiber optic emitters and detectors on the cranium for volumetric imaging of brain
activation. Optical coherence tomography is a sensitive interferometric imaging
technique that can be implemented in a variety of fiber based formats and that
might allow intrinsic optical detection of brain activity at a high resolution.
Miniaturized fiber optic microscopy permits cellular level imaging in the brains 
of behaving animals. Together, these modalities will enable new uses of imaging
in the intact nervous system for both research and clinical applications.

Nonlinear microscopy, a general term that embraces any microscopy technique based
on nonlinear optics, is further establishing itself as an important tool in
neurobiology. Recent advances in labels, labeling techniques, and the use of
native or genetically encoded contrast agents have bolstered the capacity of
nonlinear microscopes to image the structure and function of not just single
cells but of entire networks of cells. Along with novel strategies to image over 
exceptionally long durations and with increased depth penetration in living
brains, these advances are opening new opportunities in neurobiology that were
previously unavailable.

Spatio-temporal visualization of cellular structures by fluorescence microscopy
has become indispensable in biology. However, the resolution of conventional
fluorescence microscopy is limited by diffraction to about 180 nm in the focal
plane and to about 500 nm along the optic axis. Recently, concepts have emerged
that overcome the diffraction resolution barrier fundamentally. Formed on the
basis of reversible saturable optical transitions, these concepts might
eventually allow us to investigate hitherto inaccessible details within live
cells.

Emerging techniques in electron microscopy promise to yield a wide range of new
information about the nervous system. Aided by the development of detectors,
electron optics, energy filters, computer automation and preparative methods,
electron tomography now provides three-dimensional structures over a scale
ranging from single receptor molecules to synapses and neurons. To relate
structure to function, a variety of correlative methods are being developed,
including protein tags observable both by light microscopy of living cells and,
subsequently, by electron microscopy. It is also becoming possible to measure
functionally important ions like Ca(2+) in cellular compartments at a scale of
about 10 nm by exploiting new advances in electron energy loss and X-ray
spectroscopic imaging.

The amyloid-beta precursor protein is proteolytically cleaved by secretases,
resulting in a series of fragments, including the amyloid-beta peptide of
Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein, when membrane anchored, could
operate as a receptor. After cleavage, the soluble ectodomain exerts a trophic
function in the subventricular zone. The amyloid-beta peptide itself has a
depressant role in synaptic transmission, with both physiological and
pathological implications. During the past two years, much time has been invested
in determining the molecular pathways that regulate the processing and the signal
transduction of the amyloid precursor protein. However, the absence of consistent
and informative phenotypes in different loss of function animal models make
elucidating the molecular actions of the amyloid-beta precursor protein an
ongoing challenge.

Neurons utilize mRNA transport and local translation as a means to influence
development and plasticity. The molecular mechanisms for this mRNA sorting
involve the recognition of cis-acting sequences by distinct mRNA binding proteins
that have a dual role, acting in both mRNA transport and translational
regulation. Other proteins play a part in the assembly of messenger
ribonucleoprotein complexes into transport granules. mRNA binding proteins are
crucial targets of phosphorylation signals that regulate local translation.
Fragile X syndrome and spinal muscular atrophy have emerged as two genetic
neurological diseases that could result, in part, from impaired assembly,
localization, and translational regulation of these messenger ribonucleoproteins.

Molecular motors such as kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs), dynein superfamily 
proteins and myosin superfamily proteins have diverse and fundamental roles in
many cellular processes, including neuronal development and the pathogenesis of
neuronal diseases. During neuronal development, KIFs take significant roles in
the regulation of axon-collateral branch extension, which is essential for brain 
wiring. Cytoplasmic dynein together with LIS1 takes pivotal roles in neocortical 
layer formation. In axons, anterograde transport is mediated by KIFs, whereas
retrograde transport is mediated mainly by cytoplasmic dynein, and dysfunction of
motors results in neurodegenerative diseases. In dendrites, the transport of NMDA
and AMPA receptors is mediated by KIFs, and the motor has been shown to play a
significant part in establishing learning and memory.

Mechanisms underlying the fast action of neurotrophins include intracellular
Ca(2+) signaling, neuronal excitation, augmentation of synaptic excitation by
modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity and control of synaptic
inhibition through the regulation of the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2. The
fastest action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4/5 occurs
within milliseconds, and involves activation of TrkB and the opening of the Na(+)
channel Na(v)1.9. Through these rapid actions, neurotrophins shape neuronal
activity, modulate synaptic transmission and produce instructive signals for the 
induction of long-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission.

Neurons extend long axons and highly branched dendrites, and our understanding of
the essential regulators of these processes has advanced in recent years. In the 
past year, investigators have shown that transcriptional control,
posttranslational degradation and signaling cascades may be master regulators of 
axon and dendrite elongation and branching. Thus, evidence is mounting for the
importance of the intrinsic growth state of a neuron as a crucial determinant of 
its ability to grow, or to regenerate, axons and dendrites.

Author information:

Sphingolipid- and cholesterol-dependent microdomains (rafts) order proteins at
biological membranes and have been implicated in most signaling processes at the 
cell surface, but the principles and mechanisms through which lipid rafts
influence signaling are not well understood. Recent studies have revealed how
lipid rafts are rapidly redistributed and assembled locally in response to
extracellular signals, and how components of raft-based signaling domains undergo
rapid and regulated rearrangements influencing signal quality, duration, and
strength. These findings highlight the exquisitely dynamic properties of
signaling domains based on lipid rafts, and suggest that processes of raft
trafficking and assembly take central roles in mediating spatial and temporal
control of signaling.

The two best-known types of cell-cell communication are chemical synapses and
electrical synapses, which are formed by gap junctions. A third, less well known,
form of communication is ephaptic transmission, in which electric fields
generated by a specific neuron alter the excitability of neighboring neurons as a
result of their anatomical and electrical proximity. Ephaptic communication can
be present in a variety of forms, each with their specific features and
functional implications. One of these is ephaptic modulation within a chemical
synapse. This type of communication has recently been proposed for the
cone-horizontal cell synapse in the vertebrate retina. Evidence indicates that
the extracellular potential in the synaptic terminal of photoreceptors is
modulated by current flowing through connexin hemichannels at the tips of the
horizontal cell dendrites, mediating negative feedback from horizontal cells to
cones. This example can be added to the growing list of cases of ephaptic
communication in the central nervous system.

Neurons communicate with one another through the release of molecules from
synaptic vesicles and large dense core granules through the process of
exocytosis. During exocytosis, molecules are released to the extracellular space 
through a fusion pore, which can either dilate, resulting in full fusion, or
close, resulting in incomplete exocytosis, often referred to as 'kiss and run'
exocytosis. Recently, there has been much interest in the regulation of this
process in both neurons and neuroendocrine cells. There has been much recent work
that addresses the existence of incomplete exocytosis in neurons and
neuroendocrine cells, as well as recent work probing the molecular components and
modulation of the fusion pore.

The improvement of perceptual capabilities with training can offer important
insight into the physiological basis of learning in the cerebral cortex. The
rapid time course and ease with which some perceptual capabilities can improve
suggest that learning is an integral part of normal perception.
Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of sensory systems in the cortex
suggest that the changes underlying perceptual learning can occur in a variety of
areas and are likely to involve multiple mechanisms. In particular, recent
psychological and physiological studies suggest that perceptual learning might
often involve the task-specific suppression of signals that interfere with
performance.

The influence of early experience on the development of sensory systems.

Author information:

Once sensory stimuli become able to alter firing patterns in the developing
brain, they can influence the maturation of neuronal circuits. Recent
experimental studies add to our understanding of precisely which developmental
events are affected by early experience. In particular, it appears that
experience of the external environment can affect the brain earlier in
development and at earlier stages of sensory processing than previously thought. 
These studies emphasise the developmental importance of the patterning of
neuronal firing produced either by sensory stimuli or by spontaneous activity.
The timing of action potentials is also an important aspect of several exciting
studies describing the mechanisms - anatomical, synaptic, and molecular - by
which early experience brings about alterations in the maturation of sensory
circuitry. Importantly, this kind of approach can lead to predictions concerning 
the nature of sensory stimulation that is most effective in instructing brain
development.

Songbirds are extraordinary vocalists and sensitive listeners, singing to
communicate identity, engage other birds in acoustical combat, and attract mates.
These processes involve auditory plasticity in that birds rapidly learn to
discriminate novel from familiar songs. Songbirds also are one of the few
non-human animals that use auditory feedback to learn their vocalizations, thus
auditory -- vocal interactions are likely to be important to vocal learning.
Recent advances strengthen the connection between song recognition and processing
of birdsong in the auditory telencephalon. New insights also have emerged into
the mechanisms underlying the 'gating' of auditory responses and the emergence of
highly selective responses, two processes that could facilitate auditory feedback
important to song learning.

Although the presence of neuromodulators in mammalian sensory systems has been
noted for some time, a groundswell of evidence has now begun to document the
scope of these regulatory mechanisms in several sensory systems, highlighting the
importance of neuromodulation in shaping feature extraction at all levels of
neural processing. The emergence of more sophisticated models of sensory encoding
and of the interaction between sensory and regulatory regions of the brain will
challenge sensory neurobiologists to further incorporate a concept of sensory
network function that is contingent on neuromodulatory and behavioral state.

Several theoretical, computational, and experimental studies suggest that neurons
encode sensory information using a small number of active neurons at any given
point in time. This strategy, referred to as 'sparse coding', could possibly
confer several advantages. First, it allows for increased storage capacity in
associative memories; second, it makes the structure in natural signals explicit;
third, it represents complex data in a way that is easier to read out at
subsequent levels of processing; and fourth, it saves energy. Recent
physiological recordings from sensory neurons have indicated that sparse coding
could be a ubiquitous strategy employed in several different modalities across
different organisms.

Neuronal responses in auditory cortex show a fascinating mixture of
characteristics that span the range from almost perfect copies of physical
aspects of the stimuli to extremely complex context-dependent responses. Fast,
highly stimulus-specific adaptation and slower plastic mechanisms work together
to constantly adjust neuronal response properties to the statistics of the
auditory scene. Evidence with converging implications suggests that the neuronal 
activity in primary auditory cortex represents sounds in terms of auditory
objects rather than in terms of invariant acoustic features.

The timing of the first, and sometimes only, spike of auditory neurons evoked by 
an acoustic stimulus depends on a variety of parameters. Recent studies have
suggested that several of these dependencies originate from processes in the
first synapse of the auditory system and that first-spike timing is further
modified by central processing. The variation of first-spike latency with
stimulus parameters contains considerable information about those parameters, as 
recently explored in several sensory systems. Codes based on the relative timing 
of first spikes in ensembles of neurons appear to be easily decodable,
energetically efficient, reliable, and fast.

Pain is a fundamental experience with a complex and multi-layered neurobiological
basis. In recent years a powerful battery of techniques has been brought to bear 
to unravel the mechanisms by which painful stimuli are transduced and processed. 
There have been several recent discoveries regarding the molecular transduction
mechanisms in nociceptors and novel molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying 
the spinal processing of painful stimuli. The mechanisms by which sensory neurons
initiate hyperalgesia and touch evoked pain (allodynia) have been addressed
particularly successfully in recent studies. The rich variety of key molecular
players that have emerged in physiological and pathophysiological pain states
reflects the sophistication and uniqueness of this vitally important sense.

Pheromones have essential roles in the social behavior of most animals. Studies
of pheromone-driven behaviors are especially attractive in Drosophila
melanogaster, because these insects are genetically and molecularly well
characterized, have relatively simple central nervous systems compared with
vertebrates, and yet they display complex behaviors controlled by sophisticated
sensory systems. Like most other aspects of biology, studies on pheromone-driven 
behaviors have entered a new area, as candidate pheromone receptors and signaling
molecules have been identified through the deciphering of the Drosophila genome. 
These advances have made it possible to make specific manipulations of pheromone 
pathways for further investigation.

The past few years have delivered substantial progress in understanding the
molecular logic of the mammalian vomeronasal system. Selective expression of
vomeronasal receptors and high response selectivity of vomeronasal receptor
neurons suggest that pheromones are encoded by labeled lines at the level of the 
vomeronasal organ: each pheromonal compound is represented by the activation of a
small and exclusive subset of receptor neurons. Labeled lines might be
transferred to the accessory olfactory bulb through convergent connections. The
key challenges ahead will be to identify the pheromonal ligands of the receptors 
and unravel the functional connectivity from the vomeronasal organ to the
hypothalamus.

The discovery of two families of mammalian taste receptors has provided important
insights into taste recognition and taste perception. Recent studies have
examined the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate sweet, bitter, and
amino acid taste detection in mammals. These studies demonstrate that taste cells
are selectively tuned to different taste modalities and clarify the logic of
taste coding in the periphery.

Spiders have highly developed mechanosensory systems, some of which provide
access to forms of stimulation alien to our own sensations. Studies of
hair-shaped air movement detectors (trichobothria) and tactile sensors have
uncovered an outstanding refinement of the processes of stimulus uptake and
stimulus transformation, which reflect details of both stimulus physics and
behavioral significance. They also emphasize the potential contained in the
seemingly simple Bauplan of arthropod cuticular hairs. Embedded into the spider
exoskeleton are several thousands of strain detectors (slit sensilla) measuring
compressive exoskeletal strains induced by various forms of loads and forces. A
compound slit sensillum (lyriform organ) on the leg has become an important model
system for studies of mechanoreceptor primary processes at the cellular and
membrane level.

Animal eyes have long served as a classical example of independent origin
followed by convergence of structures onto a few different solutions. During the 
past decade this view has been challenged by the discovery of shared
developmental regulatory genes. The Pax6 gene in particular is almost universally
employed for eye formation in bilaterian animals, despite widely different
embryological origins. The resulting controversy on the multiple or single
origins of animal eyes has gradually been sharpened by continuing discoveries of 
further general similarities in the genetic regulatory circuits of eye
development. Recent work on gene expression in specified cell types, together
with comparative studies of developmental genes in cnidarians, now show some
promise to a solution of the controversy.

A major part of vision research builds on the assumption that processing of
visual stimuli can be understood on the basis of knowledge about the processing
of simplified, artificial stimuli. Recent experimental advances, however, show
that a combination of responses to simplified stimuli does not adequately
describe responses to natural visual scenes. The systems performance exceeds the 
performance predicted from understanding its basic constituents. This highlights 
the fact that the visual system is specifically adapted to the properties of its 
everyday input and can only fully be understood when probed with naturalistic
stimuli.

Reassessing mechanisms of low-frequency sound localisation.

Author information:

Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.

Interaural time differences (ITDs) are the dominant cues for human localisation
of low-frequency sounds. Although a mechanism for ITD processing proposed in 1948
seems applicable to birds, and is consistent with many aspects of the responses
found in mammals, recent data suggest that key tenets of the model might need to 
be reconsidered. The model requires, at every frequency, a distribution of cells 
with firing rate peaks across all ITD values within the animal's physiological
range. The ITD tuning relies on internal delays in the form of a neural delay
line. The evidence for such a delay line structure in mammals is not as
convincing as it is in birds and, in some small animals the full range of
physiological ITDs are not fully represented by peak firing of neurones at every 
frequency channel. Alternative means of achieving internal delays such as
inhibitory inputs or the delays associated with cochlear filtering are being
considered.

Guided by the notion that biology itself offers some of the most incisive tools
for studying biological systems, neurophysiologists rely increasingly on cell
biological mechanisms and materials encoded in DNA to visualize and control the
activity of neurons in functional circuits. Optical reporter proteins can
broadcast the operational states of genetically designated cells and synapses;
remote-controlled effectors can suppress or induce electrical activity. Many
challenges, however, remain. These include the development of novel gene
expression systems that target reporters and effectors to functionally relevant
neuronal ensembles, the capacity to monitor and manipulate multiple populations
of neurons in parallel, the ability to observe and elicit precisely timed action 
potentials, and the power to communicate with genetically designated target
neurons through electromagnetic signals other than light.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a multi-faced kinase implicated in both
development and disease of the mammalian central nervous system. These different 
faces of Cdk5 are preferentially regulated by the activation of Cdk5 by its
different binding partners. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms
governing the role of Cdk5 in brain development and disease are unclear. Emerging
evidence is now unraveling how Cdk5 normally orchestrates new signaling pathways 
that dictate the proper maturation and maintenance of the central nervous system.
Under pathological conditions, however, Cdk5 activity goes awry and the
malevolent face of Cdk5 surfaces. Recently developed animal models that display
this deregulated Cdk5 activity reveal the intimate involvement of Cdk5 in tau
pathology and neuronal cell death, and underscore the importance of
phosphorylation in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

The gene product responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism,
Parkin, has been observed to have ubiquitin ligase activity. This finding has
changed the direction of studies on Parkinson's disease by suggesting that
abnormal protein turnover might be involved in its pathogenesis. A number of
potentially neurotoxic Parkin-specific substrates have been identified. Further
investigation of Parkin knockout mice will hopefully provide new evidence in the 
search for Parkin's substrates and further clarify their role in Parkinson's
disease.

Gamma-secretase is a membrane protease complex that possesses presenilin as a
catalytic subunit. Presenilin generates amyloid beta peptides in the brains of
Alzheimer's patients and is indispensable to Notch signaling in tissue
development and renewal. Recent studies have revealed how presenilin is assembled
with its cofactor proteins and acquires the gamma-secretase activity: Aph-1 and
nicastrin initially form a subcomplex to bind and stabilize presenilin, and then 
Pen-2 confers the gamma-secretase activity and facilitates endoproteolysis of
presenilin. Understanding the mechanism of gamma-secretase cleavage will help to 
clarify how intercellular cell signaling through transmembrane proteins is
regulated by intramembrane proteolysis, and will hopefully eventually lead to a
cure for Alzheimer's disease.

Mu opioid receptors mediate positive reinforcement following direct (morphine) or
indirect (alcohol, cannabinoids, nicotine) activation, and our understanding of
mu receptor function is central to the development of addiction therapies. Recent
data obtained in native neurons confirm that mu receptor signaling and regulation
are strongly agonist-dependent. Current functional mapping reveals
morphine-activated neurons in the extended amygdala and early genomic approaches 
have identified novel mu receptor-associated proteins. A classification of about 
30 genes either promoting or counteracting the addictive properties of morphine
is proposed from the analysis of knockout mice data. The targeting of effectors
or regulatory proteins, beyond the mu receptor itself, might provide valuable
strategies to treat addictive disorders.

The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily comprises a group of
non-selective cation channels that sense and respond to changes in their local
environments. TRP channels are found in many eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals.
They are a diverse group of proteins organized into six families: classical
(TRPC), vanilloid (TRPV), melastatin (TRPM), muclopins (TRPML), polycystin
(TRPP), and ANKTM1 (TRPA). In the peripheral nervous system, stimuli including
temperature, pressure, inflammatory agents, and receptor activation effect
TRP-mediated responses. In the central nervous system, TRPs participate in
neurite outgrowth, receptor signalling and excitotoxic cell death resulting from 
anoxia. TRP channels are emerging as essential cellular switches that allow
animals to respond to their environments.

Dynamic modulation of the number of postsynaptic glutamate receptors is
considered one of the main mechanisms for altering the strength of excitatory
synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). However, until recently
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were considered relatively stable once in
the plasma membrane, especially in comparison with
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors that
are internalized at a high rate. A series of recent studies has changed this
viewpoint by revealing that NMDA receptors are subject to constitutive as well as
agonist-induced internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Surprisingly, agonist-induced internalization is not dependent on current flow
through the NMDA channel, and the receptors are primed for this type of
internalization by selective stimulation of the glycine site but not of the
glutamate site. Endocytosis of NMDA receptors provides a fundamental mechanism
for dynamic regulation of the number of NMDA receptors at synapses, which might
be important for physiological and pathological functioning of the CNS.

Glutamate transporters (GluTs) prevent the accumulation of glutamate and
influence the occupancy of receptors at synapses. The ability of extrasynaptic
NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors to participate in signaling
is tightly regulated by GluT activity. Astrocytes express the highest density of 
GluTs and dominate clearance away from these receptors; synapses that are not
associated with astrocyte processes experience greater mGluR activation and can
be exposed to glutamate released at adjacent synapses. Although less abundant,
neuronal transporters residing in the postsynaptic membrane can also shield
receptors from the glutamate that is released. The diversity in synaptic
morphology suggests a correspondingly rich diversity of GluT function in
excitatory transmission.

Changing the strength of synapses is key to the adaptive modifications of what
neuronal circuits compute. Unsurprisingly, many different mechanisms have evolved
to alter synaptic strength. Some of these mechanisms depend on the history of
synaptic use, others reflect the activity of modulatory neurons that are
controlled through neural computations, and still others involve more global
measures of neural activity. The molecular machinery synapses use to convey
information from one neuron to the next not only plays an essential part in brain
function but also is at the basis of processes that are vital to all cells.
Because membrane fusion events at synapses are so precisely controlled, synapses 
offer an especially favorable system in which to study these basic processes.
Here, I review some of the recent progress that has been made in understanding
both how synaptic strength is regulated and how fundamental cell biological
mechanisms are used to accomplish neuronal intercommunication.

Diacylglycerol is an essential second messenger in mammalian cells. The most
prominent intracellular targets of diacylglycerol and the functionally analogous 
phorbol esters belong to the protein kinase C family, but at least five
alternative types of high affinity diacylglycerol/phorbol ester receptors are
known: protein kinase D, diacylglycerol kinases alpha, beta, and gamma, RasGRPs, 
chimaerins, and Munc13s. These function independently of protein kinase C
isozymes, and form a network of signaling pathways in the diacylglycerol second
messenger system that regulates processes as diverse as gene transcription, lipid
signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, intracellular membrane trafficking, or
neurotransmitter release.

A prominent role for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in
regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission was proposed two decades ago when 
it was identified as a major postsynaptic density protein. Since then,
fascinating mechanisms optimized to fine-tune the magnitude and locations of
CaMKII activity have been revealed. The importance of CaMKII activity and
autophosphorylation to synaptic plasticity in vitro, and to a variety of learning
and memory paradigms in vivo has been demonstrated. Recent progress brings us
closer to understanding the regulation of dendritic CaMKII activity,
localization, and expression, and its role in modulating synaptic transmission
and cell morphology.

This review highlights five areas of recent discovery concerning the role of
extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) in the hippocampus. First, ERKs
have recently been directly implicated in human learning through studies of a
human mental retardation syndrome. Second, new models are being formulated for
how ERKs contribute to molecular information processing in dendrites. Third, a
role of ERKs in stabilizing structural changes in dendritic spines has been
defined. Fourth, a crucial role for ERKs in regulating local dendritic protein
synthesis is emerging. Fifth, the importance of ERK interactions with scaffolding
and structural proteins at the synapse is increasingly apparent. These topics are
discussed within the context of an emerging role for ERKs in a wide variety of
forms of synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the behaving animal.

mRNA localization and regulated translation take central roles in axon guidance
and synaptic plasticity. By spatially restricting gene expression within neurons,
local protein synthesis provides growth cones and synapses with the capacity to
autonomously regulate their structure and function. Studies in a variety of
systems have provided insight into the specific roles of local protein synthesis 
during axonal navigation and during synaptic plasticity, and have begun to
delineate the mechanisms underlying mRNA localization and regulated translation. 
Several powerful new tools have recently been developed to visualize each of
these processes.

Dendritic morphology has an important influence on neuronal information
processing. Multiple environmental cues, including neuronal activity, the
neurotrophin family of growth factors, and extracellular guidance molecules have 
been shown to influence dendritic size, shape, and development. The Rho GTPases
have emerged as key integrators of these environmental cues to regulate the
underlying dendritic cytoskeleton.

The Eph receptors are a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases with important 
roles in the establishment of neuronal and vascular networks during embryonic
development. The functions of Eph receptors in the adult brain have only recently
been investigated, and the results are forcing us to amend the conventional view 
that these molecules function predominantly in a developmental context. This
review summarizes this rapidly expanding new area of research, which has shown
that the Eph receptors regulate the structure and physiological function of
excitatory synapses through multiple mechanisms, and might thus play a
significant role in higher brain functions.

The formation of chemical synapses involves reciprocal induction and independent 
assembly of pre- and postsynaptic structures. The major events in presynaptic
terminal differentiation are the formation of the active zone and the clustering 
of synaptic vesicles. A number of proteins that are present in the presynaptic
active zone have been identified. Recent studies of various mutants have
clarified the in vivo functions of some of the main players. Time-lapse imaging
studies have captured dynamic and transient events in the transport of synaptic
components, and therefore provided insight into the early stages of
synaptogenesis.

Synaptic differentiation during development is a multi-step process, which
requires reciprocal communication between pre- and postsynaptic cells. Cell
surface interactions can induce the assembly of synaptic specializations but
maintenance and growth of synapses depend on transcriptional regulation.
Transcriptional responses associated with synaptic differentiation are observed
in central and peripheral neurons and depend on retrograde signals coming from
the target region. Although the identity of most of the retrograde signaling
pathways remains to be identified, the TGFbeta family of growth factors have
emerged as one crucial signal at the neuromuscular junction. Here, we discuss
evidence for transcriptional control during synaptic differentiation and the
signaling pathways mediating retrograde TGFbeta signaling.

Accumulative empirical evidence has been reviewed in support of the notion that
the production and perception of action as well as the interpretation of others' 
actions are functionally connected, and indeed, rely on common distributed neural
systems in the premotor and parietal cortices. We suggest that these neural
systems sustain shared representations between self and other that are crucial in
social interactions. The inferior parietal cortex plays a special role in the
sense of agency, which is a fundamental aspect to navigate within this neural
network. The role of other brain areas that implement and regulate these shared
representations remains to be specified.

Social cognitive neuroscience is an emerging discipline that seeks to explain the
psychological and neural bases of socioemotional experience and behavior.
Although research in some areas is already well developed (e.g. perception of
nonverbal social cues) investigation in other areas has only just begun (e.g.
social interaction). Current studies are elucidating; the role of the amygdala in
a variety of evaluative and social judgment processes, the role of medial
prefrontal cortex in mental state attribution, how frontally mediated controlled 
processes can regulate perception and experience, and the way in which these and 
other systems are recruited during social interaction. Future progress will
depend upon the development of programmatic lines of research that integrate
contemporary social cognitive research with cognitive neuroscience theory and
methodology.

Studies conducted in the past two years have yielded several new insights about
neuroendocrine regulation of social recognition. The social recognition deficits 
seen in oxytocin knockout mice have now been demonstrated in both males and
females, as well as in female estrogen receptor knockout mice. The male
vasopressin V1A receptor knockout mouse (but not V1B) has a profound social
recognition deficit. Preliminary evidence suggests that female V1B receptor
knockout mice could also have social memory deficits. Several lines of evidence
have emerged that indicate that neuropeptide regulation is significantly
modulated by gonadal and corticosteroid activation.

The association between genes and brain function using functional brain imaging
techniques is an emerging and promising area of research that will help to better
characterize the influence of genes on cognition and behavior as well as the link
between genetic susceptibility and neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurophysiological
imaging provides information regarding the effect of genes on brain function at
the level of information processing, and neurochemical imaging provides
information on the intrinsic mechanisms on how these genes affect the brain
response. In this review, we highlight recent studies that have begun to explore 
the influence of genetic mutations on brain function with these techniques. The
results, even from these few studies, illustrate the potential of these
techniques to provide a more sensitive assay than behavioral measures used alone.
The results also show that neuroimaging techniques can elucidate the influence of
genes on brain function in relatively small sample populations, sometimes even in
the absence of significant differences in behavioral measures.

Recent functional brain imaging studies of the neurobiology of emotion have
investigated how individual differences among subjects modulate neural responses 
during emotion processing. Differences in personality, dispositional affect,
biological sex, and genotype can all substantially modulate the neural bases of
emotion processing in prefrontal, limbic, and other brain regions, across a
variety of domains including emotional reactions, emotional memory, and emotion
perception. Analysis of individual differences provides a new window into the
neurobiology of emotion processing that complements traditional approaches.

This review summarizes recent investigations of temporal processing. We focus on 
motor and perceptual tasks in which crucial events span hundreds of milliseconds.
One key question concerns whether the representation of temporal information is
dependent on a specialized system, distributed across a network of neural
regions, or computed in a local task-dependent manner. Consistent with the
specialized system framework, the cerebellum is associated with various tasks
that require precise timing. Computational models of timing mechanisms within the
cerebellar cortex are beginning to motivate physiological studies. Emphasis has
also been placed on the basal ganglia as a specialized timing system,
particularly for longer intervals. We outline an alternative hypothesis in which 
this structure is associated with decision processes.

Recent studies in human neuroimaging, primate neurophysiology, and developmental 
neuropsychology indicate that the human ability for arithmetic has a tangible
cerebral substrate. The human intraparietal sulcus is systematically activated in
all number tasks and could host a central amodal representation of quantity.
Areas of the precentral and inferior prefrontal cortex also activate when
subjects engage in mental calculation. A monkey analogue of these parieto-frontal
regions has recently been identified, and a neuronal population code for number
has been characterized. Finally, pathologies of this system, leading to acalculia
in adults or to developmental dyscalculia in children, are beginning to be
understood, thus paving the way for brain-oriented intervention studies.

The parietal lobe forms about 20% of the human cerebral cortex and is divided
into two major regions, the somatosensory cortex and the posterior parietal
cortex. Posterior parietal cortex, located at the junction of multiple sensory
regions, projects to several cortical and subcortical areas and is engaged in a
host of cognitive operations. One such operation is selective attention, the
process where by the input is filtered and a subset of the information is
selected for preferential processing. Recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological 
studies have provided a more fine-grained understanding of the relationship
between brain and behavior in the domain of selective attention.

In 1992, Goodale and Milner proposed a division of labour in the visual pathways 
of the primate cerebral cortex between a dorsal stream specialised for the visual
control of action and a ventral stream dedicated to the perception of the visual 
world. In the years since this original proposal, support for the
perception-action hypothesis has come from neuroimaging experiments, human
neuropsychology, monkey neurophysiology, and human psychophysical experiments.
Indeed, some of the strongest support for this hypothesis has come from
behavioural experiments showing that visually guided actions are largely
refractory to perceptual illusions. Although controversial, the findings from
this literature both support the original hypothesis and suggest important
modifications. The ongoing challenge for neurobiologists is to map these
behavioural findings onto their corresponding neural substrates.

The amygdala and hippocampal complex, two medial temporal lobe structures, are
linked to two independent memory systems, each with unique characteristic
functions. In emotional situations, these two systems interact in subtle but
important ways. Specifically, the amygdala can modulate both the encoding and the
storage of hippocampal-dependent memories. The hippocampal complex, by forming
episodic representations of the emotional significance and interpretation of
events, can influence the amygdala response when emotional stimuli are
encountered. Although these are independent memory systems, they act in concert
when emotion meets memory.

Episodic memory in nonhumans: what, and where, is when?

Episodic memory is defined as the recollection of specific events in one's past, 
accompanied by the experience of having been there personally. This definition
presents high hurdles to the investigation of episodic memory in nonhumans.
Recent studies operationalize episodic memory as memory for when and where an
event occurred, for the order in which events occurred, or for an animal's own
behavior. None of these approaches has yet generalized across species, and each
fails to capture features of human episodic memory. Nonetheless, the study of
episodic memory in nonhumans seems less daunting than it did five years ago. To
demonstrate a correspondence between human episodic memory and nonhuman memory,
progress is needed in three areas. Putative episodic memories in nonhumans should
be shown to be; first, represented in long-term memory, rather than short-term or
working memory; second, explicit, or accessible to introspection; and third,
distinct from semantic memory, or general knowledge about the world.

Functional significance of adult neurogenesis.

'Function' is the key criterion for determining whether adult neurogenesis - be
it endogenous, induced, or after transplantation - is successful and has truly
generated new nerve cells. Function, however, is an elusive and problematic term.
A satisfying statement of function will require evaluation on the three
conceptual levels of cells, networks, and systems - and potentially even beyond, 
on the level of psychology. Neuronal development is a lengthy process, a fact
that must be considered when judging causes and consequences in experiments that 
address function and function-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis.
Nevertheless, the information that has been obtained and published so far
provides ample evidence that neurons generated in the adult can function and even
suggests how they might contribute to cognitive processes.

Achieving goals in changing environments requires the course of action to be
selected on the basis of goal expectation and memory of action-outcome
contingency. It is often also essential to evaluate action on the basis of
immediate outcomes and the discrimination of early action steps from the final
step towards the goal. Recently, in single-cell recordings in monkeys, the
neuronal activity that appears to underlie these processes has been noted in the 
medial part of the prefrontal cortex. Medial prefrontal cells were also active
when the subjects extracted the rules of a task in a novel environment. The
processes described above might play important roles in rule learning.

Neurophysiologists have shown repeatedly that neural activity in different brain 
structures can be correlated with specific perceptual and cognitive functions,
but the causal efficacy of the observed activity has generally been a matter of
conjecture. By contrast, electrical microstimulation, which allows the
experimenter to manipulate the activity of small groups of neurons with spatial
and temporal precision, can now be used to demonstrate causal links between
neural activity and specific cognitive functions. Here, we review this growing
literature, including applications to the study of attention, visual and
somatosensory perception, 'read-out' mechanisms for interpreting sensory maps,
and contextual effects on perception. We also discuss potential applications of
microstimulation to studies of higher cognitive functions such as decision-making
and subjective experience.

Sustained activity has been recorded in the prefrontal cortex during working
memory tasks. First, we compare the anatomical distribution of this activity in
humans and monkeys. Then, we show that it reflects many factors, maintenance of
the items presented, preparation for the response, transformation of the items
during the delay, task rules and task goals. Finally, we point out that sustained
activity has also been recorded in other areas, such as the parietal cortex. We
suggest that the key to prefrontal cortex lies not in the maintenance of sensory 
information but in the prospective use of that information for behaviour.

The complexity of drug addiction mirrors the complexity of the psychological
processes that motivate animals to work for any reinforcer, be it a natural
reward or a drug. Here, we review the role of the nucleus accumbens, together
with its dopaminergic and cortical innervation, in responding to reinforcement.
One important contribution made by the nucleus accumbens is to the process
through which neutral stimuli, once paired with a reinforcer such as a drug, have
the capacity to motivate behaviour. This process may be one of several
contributing to addiction, and it may be amenable to pharmacological
intervention.

Recent evidence indicates that networks including the amygdala and prefrontal
cortex provide a key interface between affect and cognition. Converging evidence 
from rodents, humans, and non-human primates indicates that interconnections
between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex are 
crucial to the formation and use of expectancies of reinforcers in the guidance
of goal-directed behavior.

Neurons in a small number of brain structures detect rewards and
reward-predicting stimuli and are active during the expectation of predictable
food and liquid rewards. These neurons code the reward information according to
basic terms of various behavioural theories that seek to explain reward-directed 
learning, approach behaviour and decision-making. The involved brain structures
include groups of dopamine neurons, the striatum including the nucleus accumbens,
the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. The reward information is fed to brain
structures involved in decision-making and organisation of behaviour, such as the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and possibly the parietal cortex. The neural
coding of basic reward terms derived from formal theories puts the
neurophysiological investigation of reward mechanisms on firm conceptual grounds 
and provides neural correlates for the function of rewards in learning, approach 
behaviour and decision-making.

A description of adult neural stem cells has remained somewhat elusive. With no
unique and definitive markers to label stem cells in general, neural stem cells
are difficult to identify definitively and one is forced to examine cell behavior
- leading to the retrospective identification of a stem cell. The most prevalent 
view in the literature describes the adult forebrain neural stem cell as a
relatively quiescent subependymal cell that expresses glial fibrillary acidic
protein. In this review we summarize some of the recent studies that have
supported or challenged this conception of the nature of the adult forebrain
neural stem cell. We highlight and compare the experimental paradigms that have
led to our current state of knowledge and conclude that there is no reason at
present to abandon the prevailing view of adult neural stem cell identity.

Nogo-A is one of several neurite growth inhibitory components present in
oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin membranes. Nogo has a crucial role in restricting
axonal regeneration and compensatory fibre growth in the injured adult mammalian 
CNS. Recent studies have shown that in vivo applications of Nogo neutralizing
antibodies, peptides blocking the Nogo receptor subunit NgR, or blockers of the
postreceptor components Rho-A and ROCK induce long-distance axonal regeneration
and compensatory sprouting, accompanied by an impressive enhancement of
functional recovery, in the rat and mouse spinal cord.

Microcephaly is defined as a reduction in head circumference and this clinical
finding infers that an individual has a significant diminution in brain volume.
Microcephaly can be usefully divided into primary microcephaly, in which the
brain fails to grow to the correct size during pregnancy, and secondary
microcephaly, in which the brain is the expected size at birth but subsequently
fails to grow normally. Current work suggests that primary microcephaly is caused
by a decrease in the number of neurones generated during neurogenesis, but that
in secondary microcephaly it is the number of dendritic processes and synaptic
connections that is reduced. Important insights into human neurogenesis are being
revealed by the study of rare genetic diseases that involve primary microcephaly,
illustrated by the identification of the Microcephalin, abnormal spindle in
microcephaly and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related genes. Furthermore, these
findings facilitate the search for the evolutionary changes that have lead to the
human brain being so much larger than that of any other primates.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of in vivo imaging
approaches in the study of the way that synaptic circuits become established and 
the degree to which they stabilize in mature brains. We review progress since the
first efforts, two decades ago, at in vivo synaptic imaging and highlight the
more recent advances in molecular biology, optics and neurobiological imaging
that have fueled a mini-renaissance in this line of inquiry. Many of the
technical problems that limited early efforts still remain, but the rapid pace of
molecular and optical innovation might soon transform this specialized field into
one that is more 'mainstream'.

In contrast to our detailed knowledge about the development and plasticity of
excitatory neuronal circuits, little is known about the development of inhibitory
circuits. Recent studies from the developing mammalian auditory system have
revealed the presence of substantial activity-dependent synaptic reorganization
in several inhibitory pathways. These studies importantly shed some new light on 
the general rules and cellular mechanisms that manage the organization of precise
inhibitory circuits in the developing brain.

Sensory experience drives plasticity of the body map in developing and adult
somatosensory cortex, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying such plasticity are 
not well understood. Recently, several mechanisms that are likely to contribute
to map plasticity have been directly observed in response to altered experience
in vivo. These mechanisms include long-term potentiation and long-term depression
at specific excitatory synapses, competition between lemniscal (barrel) and
non-lemniscal (septal) processing streams, and regulation of the number of
inhibitory synapses.

Neurons are connected with a high degree of specificity in neuronal circuits.
Axon guidance mechanisms are responsible for directing axons to their approximate
target region. It is not well understood how precise synaptic connections form
between specific pre- and postsynaptic neurons within the target area. Recent
analysis of a group of cell surface proteins in different systems has shed light 
on the diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate the precise
patterns of connectivity.

Dendrites show remarkable diversity in morphology and function, but the
mechanisms that produce the characteristic forms is poorly understood. Insect
systems offer a unique opportunity to manipulate and study identified neurons in 
otherwise undisturbed environments. Recent studies in Drosophila show that
dendritic targeting, branching patterns, territories, and metamorphic remodeling 
are controlled in specific ways, by intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic
cues, with important implications for function. Here, we review some recent
advances in our understanding of dendritic development in insects, focusing
primarily on insights that have been gained from studies of Drosophila.

The lateral line system is simple (comprising six cell types), its sense organs
form according to a defined and reproducible pattern, and its neurons are easily 
visualized. In the zebrafish, these advantages can be combined with a wealth of
genetic tools, making this system ideally suited to a combined molecular,
cellular and genetic analysis. Recent progress has taken advantage of these
various qualities to elucidate the mechanism that drives the migration from head 
to tail of the sense organ precursor cells, and to approach the questions
surrounding axonal guidance and target recognition.

Retinal axon guidance: novel mechanisms for steering.

Author information:

Axons from the retina traverse different molecular territories as they navigate
to the tectum. A single territory might span only a few cell diameters and
harbour multiple guidance cues, many of which are beginning to be characterized. 
Also present in the pathway are 'modulators' that influence a growth cone's
response to a coincident signal but do not guide growth directly. An emerging
principle is that the growth cone, itself, changes molecularly as it journeys
through the visual pathway. Growing retinal axons contain mRNAs, ubiquitinating
and apoptotic enzymes, translation and degradation machinery. Guidance cues can
trigger rapid and local synthesis, degradation and endocytosis of proteins,
providing a fast and flexible way for growth cones to respond to cues in their
microenvironment and to alter their responsiveness. The data raise the idea that 
the localized synthesis and downregulation of proteins might help to steer
retinal axon growth and, further, might contribute to the changing character of a
growth cone as it ages.

The mouse optic chiasm is a model for axon guidance at the midline and for
analyzing how binocular vision is patterned. Recent work has identified several
molecular players that influence the binary decision that retinal ganglion cells 
make at the optic chiasm, to either cross or avoid the midline. An ephrin-B
localized to the midline, together with an EphB receptor and a zinc-finger
transcription factor expressed exclusively in the ventrotemporal retina where
ipsilaterally projecting retinal ganglion cells are located, comprise a molecular
program for the uncrossed pathway. In addition, the mechanisms for axon
divergence in the optic chiasm are discussed in the context of other popular
models for midline axon guidance.

The growth cones of developing neurons respond to specific guidance cues in their
extracellular environment. Recent studies have shown that secreted signaling
molecules from protein families that are best known for their roles as morphogens
in specifying cell fate can function as axon guidance molecules. These signaling 
molecules seem to act directly on the growth cone and thus are likely to activate
non-canonical signaling pathways that are coupled to the cytoskeleton.

Glial cells comprise most of the non-neuronal cells of the brain and peripheral
nervous system, and include the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and Schwann
cells, radial glia and astrocytes. Their functions are diverse and include almost
every aspect of nervous system function, from the birth and death of cells to the
migrations and cell-cell interactions that connect and integrate the working
elements of the nervous system. Recent studies have provided exciting insights
into the mechanisms that drive the conversion into a glial cell and the
developmental signals that guide the behavior of these multifunctional cells. An 
emerging theme is the so-called glial lineage being more diverse and more plastic
than was previously thought. Here, we highlight some recent insights into glial
development.

Designed for general chemical recognition, the mammalian olfactory system shares 
many similarities with the immune system. Among these is the popular notion that 
a single olfactory sensory neuron expresses a single odorant receptor gene, while
all other approximately 1000 genes of this type remain silent. Here, I examine
the evidence supporting the one receptor-one neuron hypothesis. I conclude that, 
contrary to widespread belief, it is far from being proven. I propose an
hypothesis of a developmental phase of oligogenic expression that is followed by 
positive and negative selection resulting usually in cells with one expressed
receptor. Curiously, selective processes are well established and widely accepted
for lymphocytes, but these concepts are essentially ignored for olfactory sensory
neurons, despite the analogies that are frequently made between these two
systems. More attention must be paid to odorant receptor gene choice and
expression during development and neuronal differentiation.

Cellular diversity in the nervous system arises from the presence of multiple
neuronal subtypes, each of which is specialized to perform a unique function.
Work in Caenorhabditis elegans has begun to reveal the pathways that are
essential for the specification of identities of neuronal subtypes in its
chemosensory system. The functions of each chemosensory neuron subtype are
specified by distinct developmental cascades, using molecules from well-conserved
transcription factor families. Additional cellular complexity is generated by
novel mechanisms that further diversify the identities of the left and right
members of a bilateral sensory neuron pair.

Cell fate decisions and patterning in the vertebrate retina: the importance of

Malicki J(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, 243 Charles Street,

The differentiation of distinct cell populations in the retina is a multi-step
process that involves cell cycle exit, migration, and dramatic changes of cell
morphology. All these steps are tightly controlled by multiple regulatory
pathways, which involve both cell-autonomous networks of transcription factors
and cell-cell signaling events. Additional regulatory inputs into cell fate
decisions have been recently suggested: accumulating evidence shows that the
timing of cell cycle exit, the orientation of the mitotic spindle during the last
cell division, and the polarity of neuronal progenitor cells could play important
roles in cell fate determination.

One mechanism to generate daughter cells with distinct fates is the asymmetric
inheritance of regulatory proteins, leading to differential gene regulation in
the daughter cells. This mode of cell division is termed 'asymmetric cell
division.' The nervous system of the fly employs asymmetric cell division, both
in the central nervous system, to generate neural precursors, neurons and glial
cells; and in the peripheral nervous system, to create sensory organs that are
composed of multiple cell types. These cell lineages are excellent models to
examine the gene expression program that leads to fate acquisition, the cell-fate
determinants that control these programs and how these determinants, in turn, are
distributed through cell polarity machinery.

Circannual rhythms in birds.

In many birds, reproduction, molt, migration and other seasonal activities are
controlled by endogenous circannual rhythmicity. Under constant conditions, this 
rhythm persists for many cycles with a period deviating from 12 months. Whether
or not the rhythm is expressed depends on day length (photoperiod), which thus
represents an important permissive factor in the process of rhythm generation. In
nature, circannual rhythms are usually synchronized by the seasonal changes in
photoperiod. However, equatorial birds may use daytime light intensity, which
changes with the annual cycle of dry and rainy seasons, as a synchronizing
zeitgeber. Photoperiod also modulates the rate of progress of the successive
phases of the rhythmicity, such that an optimal adjustment to the annual
environmental cycle is guaranteed. Populations of a given species may differ in
their responsiveness to photoperiod in a manner that can be described as
'adaptive population-specific reaction norms'. In young migratory songbirds a
circannual program determines changes in migratory direction and, at least
partly, the time course and distance of migration. This circannual mechanism is
replaced or supplemented in older birds by mechanisms formed on the basis of
learning and memory. In general, circannual rhythms are intimately involved in
the seasonal organization of a bird's behavior, providing the substrate onto
which seasonal environmental factors act.

Birds of a feather clock together--sometimes: social synchronization of circadian
rhythms.

(1)Department of Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4328,

Biological systems use internal circadian clocks to efficiently organize
physiological and behavioral activity within the 24-hour time domain. In the
absence of time cues, circadian periods vary slightly from 24 hours, but in
nature, ambient light serves as the most salient synchronizer for these rhythms, 
fine-tuning them to exactly 24 hours each day. For some species, social cues can 
serve to synchronize circadian rhythms in the absence of other time cues or to
amplify ambiguous light cues. This has been demonstrated to various degrees in
fruit flies, degus, birds, fish, bats, beavers and humans; however, studies in
rats and hamsters have shown that social cues are less salient time cues for
these species. Social influences on circadian timing might function to tightly
organize the social group, thereby decreasing the chances of predation and
increasing the likelihood of mating.

In mammals and birds, the sex of the brain has been attributed to the action of
gonadal hormones. In males, testosterone from the testes acts early in life to
make the brain masculine. Studies of songbirds and rodents suggest, however, that
male and female brain cells are intrinsically different also because of the sex
differences in the expression of sex chromosome genes within the cells.

Echolocating bats (sub-order: Microchiroptera) form a highly successful group of 
animals, comprising approximately 700 species and an estimated 25% of living
mammals. Many echolocating bats are nocturnal predators that have evolved a
biological sonar system to orient and forage in three-dimensional space. Acoustic
signal processing and vocal-motor control are tightly coupled, and successful
echolocation depends on the coordination between auditory and motor systems.
Indeed, echolocation involves adaptive changes in vocal production patterns,
which, in turn, constrain the acoustic information arriving at the bat's ears and
the time-scales over which neural computations take place.

Weakly electric fish use their electric fields to locate objects and communicate 
with each other. Their electric discharges vary with species, gender, and social 
status. This variation is mediated by steroid and peptide hormones that influence
ion currents through changes in gene expression or phosphorylation state.
Understanding how electric fish decode the perturbations of their electric fields
that result from interactions with the discharges of other fish or prey is
illuminating general mechanisms of neuronal processing. Their central sensory
circuits are specialized to process amplitude modulated signals, to detect
microsecond variations in spike timing, and are dynamically reconfigured
depending on the stimulus parameters.

Invertebrates are outstanding model systems for the study of aggression. Recent
advances and promising new research approaches are bringing investigators closer 
to the goal of integrating behavioral findings with those from other disciplines 
of the neurosciences. The presence of highly structured, easily evoked behavioral
systems offer unique opportunities to quantify the aggressive state of
individuals, to explore the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance
of dominance relationships, to investigate the dynamic properties of hierarchy
formation, and to explore the significance of neural, neurochemical and genetic
mechanisms in these behavioral phenomena.

The brain of a honeybee contains only 960,000 neurons and its volume represents
only 1 mm3. However, it supports impressive behavioral capabilities. Honeybees
are equipped with sophisticated sensory systems and have well developed learning 
and memory capacities, whose essential mechanisms do not differ drastically from 
those of vertebrates. Here, I focus on non-elemental forms of learning by
honeybees. I show that bees exhibit learning abilities that have been
traditionally ascribed to a restricted portion of vertebrates, as they go beyond 
simple stimulus-stimulus or response-stimulus associations. To relate these
abilities to neural structures and functioning in the bee brain we focus on the
antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies. We conclude that there is a fair chance
to understand complex behavior in bees, and to identify the potential neural
substrates underlying such behavior by adopting a cognitive neuroethological
approach. In such an approach, behavioral and neurobiological studies are
combined to understand the rules and mechanisms of plastic behavior in a natural 
context.

Ants and other insects often follow fixed routes from their nest to a foraging
site. The shape of an ant's route is set, initially, by navigational strategies, 
such as path integration and the ant's innate responses to landmarks, which
depend minimally on memory. With increasing experience, these early routes are
stabilised through the learning of views of landmarks and of associated actions. 
The substitution of memory-based strategies makes an insect's route more robust
and precise. The ability to select between different learnt routes might incur
additional memory requirements to those needed for performing a route, and lead
to the associative grouping of those memories that relate to a particular route.

Learning to anticipate future events on the basis of past experience with the
consequences of one's own behavior (operant conditioning) is a simple form of
learning that humans share with most other animals, including invertebrates.
Three model organisms have recently made significant contributions towards a
mechanistic model of operant conditioning, because of their special technical
advantages. Research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster implicated the
ignorant gene in operant conditioning in the heat-box, research on the sea slug
Aplysia californica contributed a cellular mechanism of behavior selection at a
convergence point of operant behavior and reward, and research on the pond snail 
Lymnaea stagnalis elucidated the role of a behavior-initiating neuron in operant 
conditioning. These insights demonstrate the usefulness of a variety of
invertebrate model systems to complement and stimulate research in vertebrates.

Deep brain stimulation at high frequency was first used in 1997 to replace
thalamotomy in treating the characteristic tremor of Parkinson's disease, and has
subsequently been applied to the pallidum and the subthalamic nucleus. The
subthalamic nucleus is a key node in the functional control of motor activity in 
the basal ganglia. Its inhibition suppresses symptoms in animal models of
Parkinson's disease, and high frequency chronic stimulation does the same in
human patients. Acute and long-term results after deep brain stimulation show a
dramatic and stable improvement of a patient's clinical condition, which mimics
the effects of levodopa treatment. The mechanism of action may involve a
functional disruption of the abnormal neural messages associated with the
disease. Long-term changes, neural plasticity and neural protection might be
induced in the network. Similar effects of stimulation and lesioning have led to 
the extension of this technique for other targets and diseases.

For many years pathophysiological studies on patients with movement disorders
were viewed as inferior to those in animal models because, given the complexity
of dealing with the complete interconnected CNS, it was difficult to assign any
particular physiological abnormality exclusively to the site of a known lesion.
More recently this has come to be seen as an advantage. All the articles reviewed
below focus on how healthy parts of the CNS react to damage at a distance, with
the result that we are now beginning to have much more insight into how these
reactions both compensate and exacerbate the primary deficit.

The analysis of the neural mechanisms responsible for reward-related learning has
benefited from recent studies of the effects of dopamine on synaptic plasticity. 
Dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity may lead to strengthening of selected
inputs on the basis of an activity-dependent conjunction of sensory afferent
activity, motor output activity, and temporally related firing of dopamine cells.
Such plasticity may provide a link between the reward-related firing of dopamine 
cells and the acquisition of changes in striatal cell activity during learning.
This learning mechanism may play a special role in the translation of reward
signals into context-dependent response probability or directional bias in
movement responses.

Synchronous cortical oscillatory activity during motor action.

Author information: 
(1)Brain Research Unit, Helsinki University of Technology, 02740 Espoo, Finland.

Oscillations of the motor cortex interact with similar activity of the spinal
motoneuron pool in the 15-30 Hertz frequency range. Recent observations have
demonstrated how this interaction affects the firing of single corticospinal
neurons. The interaction, reflected as corticomuscular coherence, occurs for both
distal and proximal muscles and it constitutes one connection in a larger web of 
oscillatory interactions, including several other motor areas in the cortex,
thalamus, and cerebellum. New results cast light on the possible functional
significance of this interaction. The rhythmic interaction may reveal interesting
information in several motor disorders, including essential tremor, Parkinson's
disease, myoclonus epilepsy, and mirror movements.

Neurophysiological studies on non-human primates have provided a large body of
information on the response patterns of neurons in primary motor cortex during
volitional motor tasks. Rather than finding a single simple pattern of activity
in primary motor cortex neurons, these studies illustrate that neural activity in
this area reflects many different types of information, including spatial goals, 
hand motion, joint motion, force output and electromyographic activity. This
richness in the response characteristics of neurons makes estimates of any single
variable on motor performance from population signals imprecise and prone to
errors. It initially seems puzzling that so many different types of information
are represented in primary motor cortex. However, such richness in neural
responses reflects its important role in converting high-level behavioral goals
generated in other cortical regions into complex spatiotemporal patterns to
control not only alpha-motoneuron activity but also other features of spinal
processing.

Two characteristics of the thalamus--its apparently simple relay function and its
daunting multinuclear structure--have been customarily viewed as good reasons to 
study something else. Yet, now that many other brain regions have been explored
and neurophysiologists are turning to questions of how larger circuits operate,
these two characteristics are starting to seem more attractive. First, the relay 
nature of thalamic neurons means that recording from them, like tapping into a
wire, can reveal the signals carried by specific circuits. Second, the
concentration of like relay neurons into nuclei means that inactivating or
stimulating them can efficiently test the functions of the circuits. Recent
studies implementing these principles have revealed pathways through the thalamus
that contribute to generating movements and to monitoring one's own actions
(corollary discharge).

Although the eyes and head can potentially rotate about any three-dimensional
axis during orienting gaze shifts, behavioral recordings have shown that certain 
lawful strategies--such as Listing's law and Donders' law--determine which axis
is used for a particular sensory input. Here, we review recent advances in
understanding the neuromuscular mechanisms for these laws, the neural mechanisms 
that control three-dimensional head posture, and the neural mechanisms that
coordinate three-dimensional eye orientation with head motion. Finally, we
consider how the brain copes with the perceptual consequences of these motor
acts.

To maintain optimal clarity of objects moving slowly in three dimensional space, 
frontal eyed-primates use both smooth-pursuit and vergence (depth) eye movements 
to track precisely those objects and maintain their images on the foveae of left 
and right eyes. The caudal parts of the frontal eye fields contain neurons that
discharge during smooth-pursuit. Recent results have provided a new understanding
of the roles of the frontal eye field pursuit area and suggest that it may
control the gain of pursuit eye movements, code predictive visual signals that
drive pursuit, and code commands for smooth eye movements in a three dimensional 
coordinate frame.

Since its early development in the late 1940s, nuclear magnetic resonance has
become a powerful tool for applications ranging from chemical analysis or the
study of the structure of solids to biomedical investigations. In the early 1990s
the potential of this technique for functional brain mapping was demonstrated,
causing unprecedented excitement in both basic and clinical neuroscience. It was 
shown that by using the appropriate pulse sequences the so-called functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique can be made sensitive to local
magnetic susceptibility alterations produced by changes in the concentration of
deoxyhemoglobin in venous blood vessels. This blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
(BOLD) contrast mechanism was successfully implemented in awake human subjects,
in small animals, and recently in the non-human primate--the experimental animal 
of choice for the study of cognitive behavior. Simultaneous imaging and electrode
recordings promise new insights into the mechanisms by which large-scale networks
in the brain contribute to the local neural activity recorded at a given cortical
site. Moreover, the use of MRI-visible tracers and of electrical microstimulation
applied during imaging proves to be ideal for the study of connectivity in the
living animal.

Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) signal, complicating attempts to infer those changes that are
truly related to brain activation. Unlike methods of analysis of fMRI data that
test the time course of each voxel against a hypothesized waveform, data-driven
methods, such as independent component analysis and clustering, attempt to find
common features within the data. This exploratory approach can be revealing when 
the brain activation is difficult to predict beforehand, such as with complex
stimuli and internal shifts of activation that are not time-locked to an easily
specified sensory or motor event. These methods can be further improved by
incorporating prior knowledge regarding the temporal and spatial extent of brain 
activation.

High-field magnetic resonance imaging scanners with a static magnetic field of 3 
Tesla or higher are becoming ubiquitous in clinical and basic neurosciences.
Given the high cost and complexity of operation, it is important to ask whether
or not and how the use of high-field magnets can be beneficial for the
neurosciences. What new questions can be addressed? Which new insights can we
expect from these new tools? In addition, what are the limitations of these new
techniques? This review discusses the three most important applications of the
high-field magnetic resonance techniques for the neuroscience community: first,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, second, in vivo spectroscopy, and third,
in vivo fiber tracking on the basis of diffusion tensor imaging.

Molecular perturbations of neurons, including genetic knockout and transgenic
approaches, have provided insight into the cellular processes underlying neuronal
function and plasticity. A detailed understanding of how individual neurons
participate in the circuitry that controls behavior, however, will require the

Recent technologies have greatly advanced our experimental ability to modulate
the active properties of neurons with spatial and temporal precision; technical
advances have been applied to the investigation of a diverse array of
neurobiological questions.

In the past decade, the literature describing how viruses can be used to define
the synaptic architecture of the brain has increased dramatically. Early studies 
focused on determining the specificity of viral transport through synaptic
connections. Analysis of the assembly and intracellular transport of viruses as
well as of the role of the brain response to infection were central to this
literature. With the growing acceptance that the transport of viruses is
circuit-related, attention has shifted to application of the method to define the
functional architecture of neural systems. The development of attenuated
recombinant viruses that maintain neuroinvasiveness has been instrumental to the 
generation of increasingly powerful experimental approaches for the functional
dissection of neural circuits. These approaches include the use of recombinant
viruses that express unique reporters to address issues of axon collateralization
in complex circuits, the use of green-fluorescent-protein-expressing recombinants
to characterize the electrophysiological properties of projection-specific
neurons in live slices of brain, and the exploitation of the Cre recombinase
system for conditional replication of virus in phenotypically defined populations
of neurons.

Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive, volume rendering diagnostic
technique that uses lanthanide complexes to enhance proton relaxation. Magnetic
resonance imaging is not limited by light scattering as optical microscopic
techniques are, and allows imaging of whole animals. Clinical contrast agents are
nonspecific and report solely on anatomy, whereas contrast agents that can be
activated can be tailored to report on the physiological status or metabolic
activity of biological systems. These new classes of magnetic resonance contrast 
agents represent a substantial leap in the type of information that can be
derived from imaging experiments, and are the focus of this review.

Genetically encoded probes for the optical imaging of excitable cell activity
have been constructed by fusing fluorescent proteins to functional proteins that 
are involved in physiological signaling systems, such as those that control
membrane potential, free calcium and cyclic nucleotide concentrations and pH.
Using specific promoters and targeting signals, the probes are introduced into an
intact organism and directed to specific tissue regions, cell types, and
subcellular compartments, thereby extracting specific signals more efficiently
and in a more relevant physiological context than before. Optical imaging using
genetically encoded probes has enabled us to decipher spatio-temporal information
coded in complex tissues.

Based on time-averaging fluctuation analysis of small fluorescent molecular
ensembles in equilibrium, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has recently been
applied to investigate processes in the intracellular milieu. The exquisite
sensitivity of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy provides access to a
multitude of measurement parameters (rates of diffusion, local concentration,
states of aggregation and molecular interactions) in real time with fast temporal
and high spatial resolution. The introduction of dual-color cross-correlation,
imaging, two-photon excitation, and coincidence analysis coupled with
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has expanded the utility of the technique
to encompass a wide range of promising applications in living cells that may
provide unprecedented insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms of
intracellular neurobiological processes.

Chronic changes in activity can induce neurons to alter the strength of all their
synapses in unison. Although the specific changes that occur appear to vary
depending on the experimental preparation, their net effect is to counter the
experimentally induced modification of activity. Such adaptive, cell-wide changes
in synaptic strength serve to stabilize neuronal activity and are collectively
referred to as homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have shed light on
what triggers homeostatic synaptic plasticity, whether or not it is distinct from
other forms of synaptic plasticity and whether or not it occurs in the intact

Axo-glial interactions are required for the organization of highly specialized
molecular domains in myelinated axons. The molecular composition of these domains
includes cell adhesion molecules, ion channels and cytoskeletal proteins. Recent 
genetic and molecular studies provide new insights into how these macromolecular 
complexes are assembled and organized into functional domains, and how the loss
of individual components affects domain organization and function. More
importantly, the key molecular components identified at the vertebrate axo-glial 
septate junctions are also present at the Drosophila septate junctions. In
addition, new roles for axo-glial paranodal septate junctions have emerged, which
suggest that the paranodal region may act as an ionic barrier and a molecular
fence in myelinated axons.

One of the major obstacles to successful axon regeneration in the adult CNS is
the presence of inhibitory molecules that are associated with myelin. Recent
studies have identified several major myelin-associated inhibitors along with the
relevant signaling molecules. Such advances have not only enhanced our
understanding of the signaling mechanisms that are involved in the inhibition of 
axon regeneration in the adult CNS but also allowed us to assess the therapeutic 
potential of blocking these inhibitory influences to promote axon regeneration.

Recent studies provide insights into the mechanisms by which Abelson non-receptor
tyrosine kinases relay information from axon guidance and growth factor receptors
to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements in developing neurons. Abelson
non-receptor tyrosine kinases are also found in mature synapses, where their
activities are required for optimal synaptic function.

Cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgCAMS) play pivotal
roles during synapse development and remodeling, being required in both
activity-dependent and activity independent aspects of these processes. Recent
advances using the fruit fly neuromuscular junction, as well as the mollusk
Aplysia californica, have provided evidence for at least three mechanisms by
which levels of IgCAMs are regulated during synapse
remodeling--activity-dependent regulation of IgCAM clustering by PSD-95-type
molecules, IgCAM internalization by MAP kinase pathway activation, and
postsynaptic IgCAM exocytosis. These studies offer convincing evidence that
synaptic cell adhesion brings about both negative and positive forces that
stabilize synapses, while maintaining their ability to change in an
activity-dependent manner.

Cadherins are Ca(2+)-dependent intercellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) and they
play key roles in the intercellular junctions of a wide variety of cells,
including interneuronal synapses. Nectins are Ca(2+)-independent
immunoglobulin-like CAMs and they are also involved in the organization of
various types of intercellular junctions, including interneuronal synapses,
either in cooperation with or independently of cadherins. Intercellular adhesion 
through nectins induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, leading to 
a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, and cell
polarization.

In response to incoming action potentials the presynapse exocytoses
neurotransmitter filled vesicles. Proper information encoding requires that the
release occurs exactly at the junction to the postsynapse, that it is temporally 
tightly coupled to the electrical signal and that it proceeds efficiently. This
review discusses the structure and function of the active zone, which is defined 
as the region of the presynapse that is specialized for vesicle release.
Particular emphasis is put on the molecular players that control spatial
restriction, efficiency and timing of exocytosis in the mammalian nervous system.

Converging evidence indicates that primates have a distinct cortical image of
homeostatic afferent activity that reflects all aspects of the physiological
condition of all tissues of the body. This interoceptive system, associated with 
autonomic motor control, is distinct from the exteroceptive system (cutaneous
mechanoreception and proprioception) that guides somatic motor activity. The
primary interoceptive representation in the dorsal posterior insula engenders
distinct highly resolved feelings from the body that include pain, temperature,
itch, sensual touch, muscular and visceral sensations, vasomotor activity,
hunger, thirst, and 'air hunger'. In humans, a meta-representation of the primary
interoceptive activity is engendered in the right anterior insula, which seems to
provide the basis for the subjective image of the material self as a feeling
(sentient) entity, that is, emotional awareness.

Carotid body glomus cells sense hypoxia through the inhibition of plasmalemmal
K(+) channels, which leads to Ca(2+) influx and transmitter release. Although the
mechanism of O(2) sensing remains enigmatic, it does not seem to depend on
cellular redox status or inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport. Hypoxia 
inducible factors appear to be necessary for the expression of the O(2) sensor
and carotid body remodeling in chronic hypoxia, but are not directly involved in 
acute O(2) sensing. Glomus cells are also rapidly activated by reductions of
glucose concentration due to inhibition of K(+) channels. These cells function as
combined O(2) and glucose sensors that help to prevent neuronal damage by acute
hypoxia and/or hypoglycemia.

Sensory neurons report a wide range of temperatures, from noxious heat to noxious
cold. Natural products that elicit psychophysical sensations of hot or cold, such
as capsaicin or menthol, were instrumental in the discovery of thermal detectors 
belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation channels.
Studies are now beginning to reveal how these channels contribute to
thermosensation and how chemical signaling pathways, such as those activated by
tissue injury, alter thermal sensitivity through TRP channel modulation. Analysis
of TRP channel expression among sensory neurons is also providing insight into
how thermal stimuli are encoded by the peripheral nervous system.

The exquisite specificity in the organization of the mammalian olfactory system

The olfactory bulb employs lateral and feedback inhibitory pathways to distribute
odor information across parallel assemblies of mitral and granule cells. The
pathways involve dendritic action potentials that can interact with a variety of 
voltage-dependent conductances and synaptic transmission to produce complex and
dynamic patterns of activity. Electrical coupling also helps to ensure proper
coordination and synchronization of these patterns. These mechanisms provide
numerous options for dynamic modulation and control of signaling in the olfactory
bulb.

Exposure of olfactory receptor cells to odour stimulates the influx of Ca(2+)
through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels into the small volume within the cilia, 
the site of olfactory transduction. The consequent rise in intraciliary Ca(2+)
concentration has two opposing effects: activation of an unusual excitatory Cl(-)
conductance, and negative feedback actions on various stages of the odour
transduction mechanism. Recent studies are beginning to unravel how Ca(2+)
performs this dual function, and how the spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca(2+) 
modulate the odour response. The feedback actions of Ca(2+) on different elements
of the transduction cascade seem to occur on different timescales, and are
therefore responsible for shaping different parts of the receptor current
response to odour stimulation.

The amplification of acoustic stimuli is a feature of hair cells that evolved
early on in vertebrates. Though standard stereocilia mechanisms to promote such
amplification may persist in the mammal, an additional mechanism evolved to
enhance high frequency sensation. Only in mammals, a special cell type, the outer
hair cell, arose that possesses a remarkably fast somatic mechanical response,
which probably endows the passive cochlea with a boost in sensitivity by a factor
of 100 (40dB), at least. Experiments conducted over the past few years have shed 
light on many aspects of outer hair cell electromotility, including the molecular
identification of the motor, the effects of a knockout, and underlying mechanisms
of action. A review of this remarkable progress is attempted.

Mechanosensory hair cells of the cochlea must serve as both transducers and
presynaptic terminals, precisely releasing neurotransmitter to encode acoustic
signals for the postsynaptic afferent neuron. Remarkably, each inner hair cell
serves as the sole input for 10-30 individual afferent neurons, which requires
extraordinary precision and reliability from the synaptic ribbons that marshal
vesicular release onto each afferent. Recent studies of hair cell membrane
capacitance and postsynaptic currents suggest that the synaptic ribbon may
operate by simultaneous multi-vesicular release. This mechanism could serve to
ensure the accurate timing of transmission, and further challenges our
understanding of this synaptic nano-machine.

The narrow stimulus limits of hair cell transduction, equivalent to a total
excursion of about 100nm at the tip of the hair bundle, demand tight regulation
of the mechanical input to ensure that the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET)
channels operate in their linear range. This control is provided by multiple
components of Ca(2+)-dependent adaptation. A slow mechanism limits the mechanical
stimulus through the action of one or more unconventional myosins. There is also 
a fast, sub-millisecond, Ca(2+) regulation of the MET channel, which can generate
resonance and confer tuning on transduction. Changing the conductance or kinetics
of the MET channels can vary their resonant frequency. The tuning information
conveyed in transduction may combine with the somatic motility of outer hair
cells to produce an active process that supplies amplification and augments
frequency selectivity in the mammalian cochlea.

Although nearly half of the synaptic input to neurons in the dorsal thalamus
comes from the cerebral cortex, the role of corticothalamic projections in
sensory processing remains elusive. Although sensory afferents certainly
establish the basic receptive field properties of thalamic neurons, increasing
evidence indicates that feedback from the cortex plays a crucial role in shaping 
thalamic responses. Here, we review recent work on the corticothalamic pathways
associated with the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. Collectively,
these studies demonstrate that sensory responses of thalamic neurons result from 
dynamic interactions between feedforward and feedback pathways.

Ambiguous figures that may take on the appearance of two or more distinct forms
have fascinated philosophers and psychologists for generations. Recently, several
laboratories have studied the neuronal basis of perceptual appearance at the
level of single neurons in the cerebral cortex. Experiments that integrate
neuronal recording with analyses based on sensory detection theory reveal a
remarkable degree of specificity in these neuronal responses. The new challenges 
are to understand how cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, interact
with perception to generate these neuronal signals.

Attention influences the processing of visual information even in the earliest
areas of primate visual cortex. There is converging evidence that the interaction
of bottom-up sensory information and top-down attentional influences creates an
integrated saliency map, that is, a topographic representation of relative
stimulus strength and behavioral relevance across visual space. This map appears 
to be distributed across areas of the visual cortex, and is closely linked to the
oculomotor system that controls eye movements and orients the gaze to locations
in the visual scene characterized by a high salience.

How is the trichromatic cone mosaic of Old World primates sampled by retinal
circuits to create wavelength opponency? Red-green (L versus M cone) opponency
appears to be mediated largely by the segregation of L versus M cone signals to
the centre versus the surround of the midget ganglion cell receptive field,
implying a complex cone type-specific wiring, the basis of which remains
mysterious. Blue-yellow (S versus L+M cone) opponency is mediated by a growing
family of low-density ganglion types that receive either excitatory or inhibitory
input from S cones. Thus, the retinal circuits that underlie colour signalling in
primates may be both more complex and more diverse then previously appreciated.

Neurons in mouse visual cortex have diverse receptive field properties and they
respond selectively to specific features of visual stimuli. Owing to the lateral 
position of the eyes, only about a third of the visual cortex receives input from
both eyes, but many cells in this region are binocular. Similar to higher
mammals, closing one eye during a critical period shifts the responses of cells, 
such that they are better driven by the non-deprived eye. In this review I
illustrate how the combination of transgenic mouse technology with single cell
recording and modern imaging techniques might lead to a further understanding of 
the mechanisms that underlie the development, plasticity, and function of the
mammalian visual cortex.

Transgenic mice bearing null or functional mutations are being used to define the
roles of specific elements in phototransduction and also to time the molecular
interactions. Genetic manipulation of the collision frequency between rhodopsin
and transducin molecules identified this parameter as rate-limiting for the
photoresponse onset. Genetic interference with rhodopsin phosphorylation and
arrestin binding, transducin shut-off and calcium feedback has revealed their
respective roles in shaping the response waveform. The timetable for all of these
molecular events determines the amplitude, kinetics and reproducibility of the
photoresponse.

During development, the nervous system is confronted with a problem of enormous
complexity; to progress from a large number of 'disconnected' neurons to a
network of neuronal circuitry that is able to dynamically process sensory
information and generate an appropriate output. To form these circuits, growing
axons must make synapses with targets, usually the dendrites of postsynaptic
neurons. Although a significant amount is known about the signals that regulate
and guide developing axons, we are only now starting to understand how
environmental cues like growth factors and activity regulate the formation and
maintenance of dendrites in the developing and mature nervous system.

Rac GTPases and their effectors control cellular morphogenesis in a wide range of
developmental contexts by regulating the structure and dynamics of the actin
cytoskeleton. Although much is known about the biochemistry of Racs and Rac
regulators, less is known about how Racs control cellular morphogenesis,
including axon development, in vivo. Recent loss-of-function genetic studies
using model organisms have shown that Racs and their effectors are required for
multiple aspects of axon development, including axon outgrowth, axon guidance and
axon branching. Interestingly, these studies have also revealed that Rac activity
is required to prune spurious axons and branches. Analyses of Racs and their
upstream and downstream effectors suggest that Rac signaling is complex.
Different neurons utilize distinct combinations of upstream Rac regulators during
axon development, possibly reflecting responses to different axon path-finding
signals, and Racs use distinct downstream effectors to mediate different aspects 
of axon development, possibly reflecting differential regulation of the
lamellipodial and filopodial growth-cone actin-cytoskeleton domains underlying
axon developmental events.

The integrative properties of dendrites are determined by a complex mixture of
factors, including their morphology, the spatio-temporal patterning of synaptic
inputs, the balance of excitation and inhibition, and neuromodulatory influences,
all of which interact with the many voltage-gated conductances present in the
dendritic membrane. Recent efforts to grapple with this complexity have focused
on identifying functional compartments in the dendritic tree, the number and size
of which depend on the aspect of dendritic function being considered. We discuss 
how dendritic compartments and the interactions between them help to enhance the 
computational power of the neuron and define the rules for the induction of
synaptic plasticity.

Neuronal responses to electrical activity-induced calcium signals are specified
by the localization of the calcium entry site and the spatial properties of the
calcium transient. Calcium flux through NMDA receptors located in the synapse
initiates changes in synaptic efficacy and promotes pro-survival events, whereas 
calcium flux through extrasynaptic NMDA receptors is coupled to cell death
pathways. The dialogue between the synaptic NMDA receptors and the nucleus is
also modulated by extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, which shut down activity of
CRE-binding protein (CREB) and antagonize the increase in brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression induced by synaptic NMDA receptors. The
specification of the biological response by the localization of the receptor
activated is a new concept in neuronal calcium signalling that can explain many
of the opposing roles of NMDA receptors.

Signaling from synapse to nucleus is vital for activity-dependent control of
neuronal gene expression and represents a sophisticated form of neural
computation. The nature of specific signal initiators, nuclear translocators and 
effectors has become increasingly clear, and supports the idea that the nucleus
is able to make sense of a surprising amount of fast synaptic information through
intricate biochemical mechanisms. Information transfer to the nucleus can be
conveyed by physical translocation of messengers at various stages within the
multiple signal transduction cascades that are set in motion by a Ca(2+) rise
near the surface membrane. The key role of synapse-to-nucleus signaling in
circadian rhythms, long-term memory, and neuronal survival sheds light on the
logical underpinning of these signaling mechanisms.

Opiate drugs such as morphine and heroin are among the most effective analgesics 
known. Prolonged or repeated administration of opiates produces adaptive changes 
in the nervous system that lead to reduced drug potency or efficacy (tolerance), 
as well as physiological withdrawal symptoms and behavioral manifestations such
as craving when drug use is terminated (dependence). These adaptations limit the 
therapeutic utility of opiate drugs, particularly in the treatment of chronically
painful conditions, and are thought to contribute to the highly addictive nature 
of opiates. For many years it has been proposed that physiological tolerance to
opiate drugs is associated with a modification of the number or functional
activity of opioid receptors in specific neurons. We now understand certain
mechanisms of opioid receptor desensitization and endocytosis in considerable
detail. However, the functional roles that these mechanisms play in the complex
physiological adaptation of the intact nervous system to opiates are only
beginning to be explored.

Fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is largely mediated by GABA(A) receptors.
These ligand-gated ion channels are crucial in the control of cell and network
activity. Therefore, modulating their function or cell surface stability will
have major consequences for neuronal excitation. It has become clear that the
stability and activity of GABA(A) receptors at synapses can be dynamically
modulated by receptor trafficking and phosphorylation. Here, we discuss these
regulatory mechanisms, and their consequences for the efficacy of GABA(A)
receptor mediated synaptic inhibition.

Physiological roles for postsynaptic molecules in synaptogenesis and plasticity
are under intense investigation. Recent imaging experiments, including GFP-based 
and single-particle tracking strategies, reveal rapid movement of synaptic
components to and from the postsynaptic sites. Furthermore, specific patterns of 
neuronal activity and/or activation of specific transmitter receptors trigger
selective translocation of postsynaptic components. These emerging dynamic
properties of synaptic specializations add another layer of complexity to the
signaling mechanisms of CNS synapses.

Although the strength of quantal synaptic transmission is jointly controlled by
pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms, the presynaptic mechanisms remain
substantially less well characterized. Recent studies reveal that a single
package of neurotransmitter is generally insufficient to activate all available
postsynaptic receptors, whereas the sum of transmitter from multiple vesicles can
result in receptor saturation. Thus, depending upon the number of vesicles
released, a given synaptic pathway might be either 'reliable' or 'unreliable'. A 
lack of receptor saturation in turn makes it possible to modify quantal size by
altering the flux of transmitter through the synaptic cleft. Studies are now
illuminating several new mechanisms behind the regulation of this transmitter
flux--characteristics that control how transmitter is loaded into vesicles, how
it is released and the manner by which it interacts with postsynaptic receptors.

Is synaptotagmin the calcium sensor?

Author information: 
(1)Picower Center for Learning and Memory and Department of Biology,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

After much debate, recent progress indicates that the synaptic vesicle protein
synaptotagmin I probably functions as the calcium sensor for synchronous
neurotransmitter release. Following calcium influx into presynaptic terminals,
synaptotagmin I rapidly triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma 
membrane and underlies the fourth-order calcium cooperativity of release.
Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that lipid and SNARE interactions
underlie synaptotagmin's ability to mediate the incredible speed of vesicle
fusion that is the hallmark of fast synaptic transmission.

In vertebrates, the physical coupling between presynaptic calcium channels and
synaptic vesicle release proteins enhances the efficiency of neurotransmission.
Recent evidence indicates that these synaptic proteins may feedback directly on
synaptic release by negatively regulating calcium entry, and indirectly through
pathways involving second messenger molecules. Studies of individual neurons from
both vertebrates and invertebrates have provided novel insights into the roles of
scaffolding proteins in calcium channel targeting and neurotransmitter release.
These studies require us to expand current models of synaptic transmission.

Voltage-gated calcium channels are important mediators of several physiological
processes, including neuronal excitability and muscle contraction. At the
molecular level, the channels are composed of four subunits--the pore forming
alpha(1) subunit and the auxiliary alpha(2)delta, beta and gamma subunits. The
auxiliary subunits modulate the trafficking and the biophysical properties of the
alpha(1) subunit. In the past several years there has been an acceleration of our
understanding of the auxiliary subunits, primarily because of their molecular
characterization and the availability of spontaneous and targeted mouse mutants. 
These studies have revealed the crucial role of the subunits in the functional
effects that are mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels.

Use-dependent inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) are important
therapeutic tools for chronic pain management, but are limited by possible severe
side effects. Recent studies have provided much new information on the function
of several voltage-gated sodium channels that are predominantly expressed in
peripheral sensory neurons, and on their possible link to pathological pain
states arising from injuries to the sensory nerve. The use of antisense
oligonucleotides to target specific channel subtypes shows that the functional
localization of the channel subtype Na(V)1.8 after nerve injury is essential for 
persistent pain states. The putative roles of Na(V)1.3 and Na(V)1.9 in
neuropathic pain are also discussed. These studies may form a basis for
developing inhibitors to target specific channel subtype(s) for use in chronic
pain treatment.

Rapid inactivation of sodium channels is crucial for the normal electrical
activity of excitable cells. There are many different types of inactivation,
including fast, slow and ultra-slow, and each of these can be modulated by
cellular factors or accessory subunits. Fast inactivation occurs by a 'hinged
lid' mechanism in which an inactivating particle occludes the pore, whereas slow 
inactivation is most likely to involve a rearrangement of the channel pore.
Subtle defects in either inactivation process can lead to debilitating human
diseases, including periodic paralyses in muscle, ventricular fibrillation and
long QT syndrome (delayed cardiac repolarization) in the heart, and epilepsy in
the CNS.

RNA editing by select adenosine deamination (A-to-I editing) alters functional
determinants in certain ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in
vertebrates and invertebrates. In most cases, edited and unedited versions of a
given receptor/channel co-exist to expand the functional space of the receptor
population. Recent studies have characterized K(+) channels in squid that are
edited at multiple positions, revealed a role for Q/R site editing in AMPA
receptor assembly, and demonstrated a link between serotonin levels and the
extent of editing of a mammalian serotonin receptor.

In the twelve years since the molecular elucidation of the metabotropic glutamate
receptor subtype 1, a class III family of G-protein-coupled receptors has
emerged; members of this family include the calcium-sensing receptor, the GABA(B)
receptor, some odorant receptors and some taste receptors. Atomic structures of
the ligand-binding core of the original metabotropic glutamate receptor 1
obtained using X-ray crystallography provide a foundation for determining the
initial receptor activation of this important family of G-protein-coupled
receptors.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a surprisingly versatile tool in the
quest for disentangling the complexities of mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia. Yet, the identification of pathognomonic physiological features of
the illness or even a consensus regarding the interpretation of reported findings
remain unfulfilled goals, in spite of the increasing sophistication of this
technology. Nonetheless, by providing quantification of brain function during
various cognitive challenges, functional MRI has been used to leap ahead of these
quandaries to identify relationships between genetic variation and brain
function. By examining recent findings and efforts to link these findings to
genes, this article will review these exciting developments in schizophrenia
research.

A recent review of neuroimaging data on time measurement argued that the brain
activity seen in association with timing is not influenced by specific
characteristics of the task performed. In contrast, we argue that careful
analysis of this literature provides evidence for separate neural timing systems 
associated with opposing task characteristics. The 'automatic' system draws
mainly upon motor circuits and the 'cognitively controlled' system depends upon
prefrontal and parietal regions.

In many regions of the brain, information is represented by patterns of activity 
occurring over populations of neurons. Understanding the encoding of information 
in neural population activity is important both for grasping the fundamental
computations underlying brain function, and for interpreting signals that may be 
useful for the control of prosthetic devices. We concentrate on the
representation of information in neurons with Poisson spike statistics, in which 
information is contained in the average spike firing rate. We analyze the
properties of population codes in terms of the tuning functions that describe
individual neuron behavior. The discussion centers on three computational
questions: first, what information is encoded in a population; second, how does
the brain compute using populations; and third, when is a population optimal? To 
answer these questions, we discuss several methods for decoding population
activity in an experimental setting. We also discuss how computation can be
performed within the brain in networks of interconnected populations. Finally, we
examine questions of optimal design of population codes that may help to explain 
their particular form and the set of variables that are best represented. We show
that for population codes based on neurons that have a Poisson distribution of
spike probabilities, the behavior and computational properties of the code can be
understood in terms of the tuning properties of individual cells.

Traditional studies of motor learning and prediction have focused on how subjects
perform a single task. Recent advances have been made in our understanding of
motor learning and prediction by investigating the way we learn variable tasks,
which change either predictably or unpredictably over time. Similarly, studies
have examined how variability in our own movements affects motor learning.

The ability to learn novel motor skills has fundamental importance for adaptive
behavior. Neocortical mechanisms support human motor skill learning, from simple 
practice to adaptation and arbitrary sensory-motor associations. Behavioral and
neural manifestations of motor learning evolve in time and involve multiple
structures across the neocortex. Modifications of neural properties, synchrony
and synaptic efficacy are all related to the development and maintenance of motor
skill.

Persistent neural activity is observed in many systems, and is thought to be a
neural substrate for holding memories over time delays of a few seconds. Recent
work has addressed two issues. First, how can networks of neurons robustly hold
such an active memory? Computer systems obtain significant robustness to noise by
approximating analogue quantities with discrete digital representations. In a
similar manner, theoretical models of persistent activity in spiking neurons have
shown that the most robust and stable way to store the short-term memory of a
continuous parameter is to approximate it with a discrete representation. This
general idea applies very broadly to mechanisms that range from biochemical
networks to single cells and to large circuits of neurons. Second, why is it
commonly observed that persistent activity in the cortex can be strongly
time-varying? This observation is almost ubiquitous, and therefore must be taken 
into account in our models and our understanding of how short-term memories are
held in the cortex.

The ability to readily adapt to novel situations requires something beyond
storing specific stimulus-response associations. Instead, many animals can detect
basic characteristics of events and store them as generalized classes. Because
these representations are abstracted beyond specific details of sensory inputs
and motor outputs, they can be easily generalized and adapted to new
circumstances. Explorations of neural mechanisms of sensory processing and motor 
output have progressed to the point where studies can begin to address the neural
basis of abstract, categorical representations. Recent studies have revealed
their neural correlates in various cortical areas of the non-human primate brain.

Flexible control of behavior requires the selective processing of task-relevant

Visual attention, the mechanism by which observers select relevant or important
information from scenes, can be deployed to locations in space or to spatially
invariant object representations. Studies have examined both the modulatory
effects of attention on the strength of extrastriate cortical representations,
and the control of attention by parietal and frontal cortical circuits.
Subregions of parietal and frontal cortex are transiently active when attention
is voluntarily shifted between spatial locations or object representations. This 
transient activity may reflect an abrupt shift in the attentional set of the
observer, complementing sustained signals that are thought to maintain a given
attentive state.

Recent studies aim to explain the duration and variability of behavioral reaction
time in terms of neural processes. The time taken to make choices is occupied by 
at least two processes. Neurons in sensorimotor structures accumulate evidence
that leads to alternative categorizations, while other neurons within these
structures prepare and initiate overt responses. These distinct stages of
stimulus encoding and response preparation support variable but flexible
behavior.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used widely to determine the
spatial layout of brain activation associated with specific cognitive tasks at a 
spatial scale of millimeters. Recent methodological improvements have made it
possible to determine the latency and temporal structure of the activation at a
temporal scale of few hundreds of milliseconds. Despite the sluggishness of the
hemodynamic response, fMRI can detect a cascade of neural activations - the
signature of a sequence of cognitive processes. Decomposing the processing into
stages is greatly aided by measuring intermediate responses. By combining
event-related fMRI and behavioral measurement in experiment and analysis,
trial-by-trial temporal links can be established between cognition and its neural
substrate.

by a variety of experimental approaches in animals and humans. It remains a
daunting challenge to reconcile data as diverse as synaptic properties recorded
in a rodent brain slice and functional images of auditory cortex in a behaving
human. Nevertheless, the gaps are narrowing through a renewed focus on humans and
other primates, a continuing interest in evidence for functional pathways, a
broader application of modern imaging techniques, a growing awareness of cortical
sensitivity to dynamic features of sounds, and an improved understanding of

functional properties of extrastriate regions in the ventral visual pathway that

functional properties of these regions, and the correlation between the
activation of these regions and visual recognition, indicate that the lateral and

It is widely believed that visual systems are optimized for the visual properties
of the environment inhabited by the organism. A specific instance of this
principle is known as the Efficient Coding Hypothesis, which holds that the
purpose of early visual processing is to produce an efficient representation of
the incoming visual signal. The theory provides a quantitative link between the
statistical properties of the world and the structure of the visual system. As
such, specific instances of this theory have been tested experimentally, and have

The past year has yielded many insights and a few surprises in the field of
axonal regeneration. The identification of oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein as
an inhibitor of axonal growth, and the discovery that the three major
myelin-associated inhibitors of CNS regeneration share the same functional
receptor, has launched a new wave of studies that aim to identify the signaling
components of these inhibitory pathways. These findings also offer new avenues of
research directed toward blocking possible therapeutic targets that inhibit
regeneration and toward encouraging axonal regeneration in the CNS after injury.

Evidence for neuronal self-repair following insults to the adult brain has been
scarce until very recently. Ischaemic insults have now been shown to trigger
neurogenesis from neural stem cells or progenitor cells located in the dentate
subgranular zone, the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle, and the
posterior periventricle adjacent to the hippocampus. New neurons migrate to the
granule cell layer or to the damaged CA1 region and striatum, where they express 
morphological markers characteristic of those neurons that have died. Some
evidence indicates that these neurons can re-establish connections and contribute
to functional recovery.

The discovery of hair cell regeneration in the inner ear of birds provides new

Glutamate mediates most excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. Synaptic
strength at glutamatergic synapses shows a remarkable degree of use-dependent
plasticity and such modifications may represent a physiological correlate to
learning and memory. Glutamate receptors and downstream enzymes are organized at 
synapses by cytoskeletal proteins containing multiple protein-interacting
domains. Recent studies demonstrate that these 'scaffolding' proteins within the 
postsynaptic specialization have the capacity to promote synaptic maturation,
influence synapse size, and modulate glutamate receptor function.

Recent experiments in Drosophila demonstrate striking stereotypy in the neural
architecture of the olfactory system. Functional imaging experiments in mammals
and honeybees suggest a mechanism of odor coding that translates discrete
patterns of activity in olfactory glomeruli into an odor image. Future
experiments in Drosophila may permit a direct test of this odor-coding
hypothesis.

Significant advances have been made during the past few years in our
understanding of how the spinal monosynaptic reflex develops. Transcription
factors in the Neurogenin, Runt, ETS, and LIM families control sequential steps
of the specification of various subtypes of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons. 
The initiation of muscle spindle differentiation requires neuregulin 1, derived
from Ia afferent sensory neurons, and signaling through ErbB receptors in
intrafusal muscle fibers. Several retrograde signals from the periphery are
important for the establishment of late connectivity in the reflex circuit.
Finally, neurotrophin 3 released from muscle spindles regulates the strength of
sensory-motor connections within the spinal cord postnatally.

The neuronal wiring of the Drosophila melanogaster visual system is constructed
through an intricate series of cell-cell interactions. Recent studies have
identified some of the gene regulatory and cytoskeletal signaling pathways
responsible for the layer-specific targeting of Drosophila photoreceptor axons.
Target selection decisions of the R1-R6 subset of photoreceptor axons have been
found to be influenced by the nuclear factors Brakeless and Runt, and target
selection decisions of the R7 subset of axons have been found to require the
cell-surface proteins Ptp69d, Lar and N-cadherin. A role for the visual system
glia in orienting photoreceptor axon outgrowth and target selection has also been
uncovered.

Semaphorins constitute one of the largest families of repulsive and attractive
growth cone guidance proteins. They affect the growth cone's actin cytoskeleton
through interactions with receptor complexes composed of ligand-binding,
signal-transducing, and modulatory subunits. Our understanding of the
intracellular signal transduction machinery linking semaphorins to actin dynamics
is limited; however, recent advances provide a more comprehensive view of the
molecular basis of neuronal semaphorin signaling.

Work in flies, nematodes and vertebrates has shown that genes involved in axon
patterning at the ventral midline are functionally conserved across phylogeny.
Recent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated several new
extracellular molecules, such as nidogen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in
axonal tract formation at the midline. Furthermore, a conceptually new mechanism 
that regulates the maintenance of axon positioning at the midline has been
described in C. elegans.

Topographic maps are a fundamental organizational feature of axonal connections
in the brain. A prominent model for studying axial polarity and topographic map
development is the vertebrate retina and its projection to the optic tectum (or
superior colliculus). Linked processes are controlled by molecules that are
graded along the axes of the retina and its target fields. Recent studies
indicate that ephrin-As control the temporal-nasal mapping of the retina in the
optic tectum/superior colliculus by regulating the topographically-specific
interstitial branching of retinal axons along the anterior-posterior tectal axis.
This branching is mediated by relative levels of EphA receptor repellent
signaling. A major recent advance is the demonstration that EphB receptor forward
signaling and ephrin-B reverse signaling mediate axon attraction to control
dorsal-ventral retinal mapping along the lateral-medial tectal axis. In addition,
several classes of regulatory proteins have been implicated in the control of the
axial patterning of the retina, and its ultimate readout of topographic mapping.

The telencephalon is the most diverse region of the brain with respect to both
morphology and neuronal subtypes. This fact makes the task of unraveling the
mechanisms underlying the development of this brain region rather daunting.
Recent attempts to subdivide the embryonic telencephalon into distinct progenitor
domains along the dorsal-ventral axis have provided an important framework on
which to begin this process. These progenitor domains are defined by the
restricted expression of transcriptional regulators and are proposed to give rise
to specific subtypes of neurons. Work over recent years has provided important
insights into the establishment and maintenance of these progenitor domains in
the developing telencephalon.

To obtain the correct number of each neuronal subtype, there must be mechanisms
to control progenitor pool size, and factors that control the differentiation of 
these progenitors into specific types of neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord,
recent advances have begun to define these mechanisms. Eight dorsal interneuron
populations have now been classified according to their expression of molecular
markers, their projection patterns, neurotransmitter type, and/or function. The
ability to identify progenitor cells and neurons in the dorsal spinal cord on the
basis of the genes they express has provided a framework for identifying
extrinsic factors that establish proliferation rate and dorsal-ventral polarity
in the developing neural tube; furthermore, this ability has helped define roles 
for basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain transcription factors in neuronal
cell-type specification.

Recent work suggests that radial glial cells represent many, if not most, of the 
neuronal progenitors in the developing cortex. Asymmetric cell division of radial
glia results in the self-renewal of the radial glial cell and the birth of a
neuron. Among the proteins that direct cell fate in Drosophila melanogaster that 
have known mammalian homologs, Numb is the best candidate to have a similar
function in radial glia. During asymmetric divisions of radial glial cells, the
basal cell may inherit the radial glial fibre, while the apical cell sequesters
the majority of the Numb protein. We suggest two models that make opposite
predictions as to whether the radial glia or nascent neuron inherit the radial
glial fiber or the majority of the Numb protein.

Nervous tissue is derived from early embryonic ectoderm, which also gives rise to
epidermal derivatives such as skin. The progression from naive ectoderm to
differentiated postmitotic neurons involves multiple steps, two of which are
crucial in shaping the final neurogenesis pattern. First, is the identification
of the neural plate by the process of neural induction. Second, is the selection 
of a restricted number of sites within the neural plate where neurogenesis, the
process leading to final differentiation of neural precursors, is initiated.
Recent findings point to the existence of positive inducers of the neural state, 
whereas, neurogenesis initiation sites appear to be largely defined by
inhibition. However, both neural induction and the initiation of neurogenesis
appear to be connected to cell cycle control systems that govern whether stem
cell maintenance and cell proliferation, or cell specification and
differentiation, take place.

The Drosophila ventral nerve cord has been a central model system for studying
the molecular genetic mechanisms that control CNS development. Studies show that 
the generation of neural diversity is a multistep process initiated by the
patterning and segmentation of the neuroectoderm. These events act together with 
the process of lateral inhibition to generate precursor cells (neuroblasts) with 
specific identities, distinguished by the expression of unique combinations of
regulatory genes. The expression of these genes in a given neuroblast restricts
the fate of its progeny, by activating specific combinations of downstream genes.
These genes in turn specify the identity of any given postmitotic cell, which is 
evident by its cellular morphology and choice of neurotransmitter.

The often extraordinary navigational behavior of birds is based in part on their 
ability to learn map-like representations of the heterogeneous distribution of
environmental stimuli in space. Whether navigating small-scale laboratory
environments or large-scale field environments, birds appear to be reliant on a
directional framework, for example that provided by the sun, to learn how stimuli
are distributed in space and to represent them as a map. The avian hippocampus
plays a critical role in some aspects of map learning. Recent results from
electrophysiological studies hint at the possibility that different aspects of
space may be represented in the activity of different neuronal types in the avian
hippocampus.

True navigation by animals is likely to depend on events occurring in the
individual cells that detect magnetic fields. Minimum thresholds of detection,
perception and 'interpretation' of magnetic field stimuli must be met if animals 
are to use a magnetic sense to navigate. Recent technological advances in animal 
tracking devices now make it possible to test predictions from models of
navigation based on the use of variations in magnetic intensity.

Recent studies revealed that although subterranean mammals inhabit a dark
underground environment, they can still perceive light stimuli and use this to
entrain their circadian activity rhythm. Regarding spatial orientation, olfactory
and tactile cues are employed for short-distance; whereas for long-distance,
subterranean mammals employ the earth's magnetic field and self-generated
(vestibular and kinestatic) cues. We suggest that seismic signals, utilized for
long-distance communication, might also be used as an echolocation mechanism to
determine digging depth and presence of obstacles ahead. Taken together, these
mechanisms provide an equally efficient means of overall orientation and
communication as those found in sighted mammals.

Insect navigation relies on path integration, a procedure by which information
about compass bearings pursued and distances travelled are combined to calculate 
position. Three neural levels of the polarization compass, which uses the
polarization of skylight as a reference, have been analyzed in orthopteran
insects. A group of dorsally directed, highly specialized ommatidia serve as
polarization sensors. Polarization-opponent neurons in the optic lobe condition
the polarization signal by removing unreliable and irrelevant components of the
celestial stimulus. Neurons found in the central complex of the brain possibly
represent elements of the compass output. The odometer for measuring travelling
distances in honeybees relies on optic flow experienced during flight, whereas
desert ants most probably use proprioreceptive cues.

Vision guides flight behaviour in numerous insects. Despite their small brain,
insects easily outperform current man-made autonomous vehicles in many respects. 
Examples are the virtuosic chasing manoeuvres male flies perform as part of their
mating behaviour and the ability of bees to assess, on the basis of visual motion
cues, the distance travelled in a novel environment. Analyses at both the
behavioural and neuronal levels are beginning to unveil reasons for such
extraordinary capabilities of insects. One recipe for their success is the
adaptation of visual information processing to the specific requirements of the
behavioural tasks and to the specific spatiotemporal properties of the natural
input.

Avenue, Davis 95616, USA. pcwainwright@ucdavis.edu

Despite considerable skepticism, researchers have found that the patterns of
muscle activation that control feeding behaviors of lower vertebrates have been
surprisingly conserved during evolution. This tendency for conservation among
taxa appears in the face of marked flexibility of motor patterns within
individuals. One interpretation of these apparently conflicting trends is that
the most effective motor pattern for any given feeding situation is the same
across substantial phylogenetic distances and morphological differences. The
novel evolutionary insight provided by this research is that historical changes
to motor patterns are a relatively infrequent source of trophic innovation. The
spectacular diversity of feeding abilities and feeding ecology in lower
vertebrates is based mostly on axes of variation, and on the innovations in the
organization of muscles and the skeletal linkage systems that they drive.

One of the challenges when considering the motor control of birdsong is to
understand how such a wide variety of temporally and spectrally diverse
vocalizations are learned and produced. A better understanding of central neural 
processing, together with direct endoscopic observations and physiological
studies of peripheral motor function during singing, has resulted in the
formation of new theoretical models of song production. Recent work suggests that
it may be more profitable to focus on the temporal relationship between control
parameters than to attempt to directly correlate neural processing with details
of the acoustic output.

The mammalian superior colliculus receives visual inputs from the retina and
primary visual cortex in its superficial layers and sends descending motor
commands from its deeper layers. It is now becoming clear that a connection
exists between these layers, but the signal transmission through it is not
robust. The induction of burst discharges in the deeper layer neurons by direct
visual inputs from the superficial layers may lead to 'express' saccadic eye
movements with extremely short reaction times in behaving animals.

Considerable evidence now demonstrates that extensive functional and anatomical
reorganization following spinal cord injury occurs in centers of the brain that
have some input into spinal motor pools. This is very encouraging, given the
accumulating evidence that new connections formed across spinal lesions may not
be initially functionally useful. The second area of advancement in the field of 
paralysis recovery is in the development of effective interventions to counter
axonal growth inhibition. A third area of significant progress is the development
of robotic devices to quantify the performance level of motor tasks following
spinal cord injury and to 'teach' the spinal cord to step and stand. Advances are

In recent years, studies of nervous mechanisms for the control of body posture
have been performed on animal models of different complexity - cat, rabbit,
lamprey and the mollusc Clione. These studies have greatly expanded our knowledge
of how the control system operates, how the system can change the stabilized body
orientation and how the postural functions are distributed within different parts
of the CNS. For simpler animal models, the postural network has been analyzed in 
considerable detail and main cell types and their interactions have been
identified.

Voltage-sensitive ionic currents shape both the firing properties of neurons and 
their synaptic integration within neural networks that drive rhythmic motor
patterns. Persistent sodium currents underlie rhythmic bursting in respiratory
neurons. H-type pacemaker currents can act as leak conductances in spinal
motoneurons, and also control long-term modulation of synaptic release at the
crayfish neuromuscular junction. Calcium currents travel in rostro-caudal waves
with motoneuron activity in the spinal cord. Potassium currents control spike
width and burst duration in many rhythmic motor systems. We are beginning to
identify the genes that underlie these currents.

Non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has opened a unique
window into human and animal brain function, with a spatial resolution of a few
millimeters and a temporal resolution of a few seconds. To further improve the
current technical limitations of fMRI, various post-processing and data
acquisition schemes were developed. Improved fMRI methods include variations of a
conventional fMRI technique, mapping a single physiological parameter such as
cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood volume, and direct mapping of neural
activity. Advances in fMRI techniques allow scientists to map submillimeter
columnar and laminar functional structures and to detect tens of millisecond
neural activity in certain specific tasks.

At present, a growing number of laboratories are acquiring the capability of
simultaneously monitoring the extracellular activity of over a hundred single
neurons in both anaesthetized and awake animals. This paradigm, known as
multielectrode recordings, is changing the face of systems neuroscience by
allowing, for the first time, the visualization of the function of entire neural 
circuits at work. Current methods of multielectrode recording employ state of the
art technologies; two potential new avenues of research will likely emerge from
the further development of these experimental paradigms.

Multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy is still developing rapidly, both
technologically and by broadening its range of application. Technical progress
has been made in the optimization of fluorophores, in increasing the imaging
depth of multiphoton microscopy, and in microscope miniaturization. These
advances further facilitate the study of neuronal structure and signaling in
living and even in behaving animals, in particular in combination with the
expression of fluorescent proteins. In addition, nonlinear optical contrast
mechanisms other than multiphoton excitation of fluorescence are being explored.

Recent technological advances have enabled the use of different optical methods
to activate neurons, including 'caged' glutamate, photoactivation of genetically 
engineered cascades, and direct two-photon excitation. The ability to use light
as a stimulation tool provides, in principle, a non-invasive method for the
temporally and spatially precise activation of any neuron or any part of a
neuron. When combined with two-photon excitation, excellent spatial control can
be achieved even in complex and highly scattering preparations, such as living
nervous tissue. Different methods that have been developed in the last several
decades have been used to probe neuronal sensitivity, mimic synaptic input, and
elucidate patterns of neural connectivity.

Biological problems such as embryonic development require tools to follow cell
and tissue movements as well as the distribution of active genes. A variety of
emerging imaging techniques offer the capability of fully rendering the
three-dimensional structure of the embryo, and some offer the possibility of
following changes directly over time. The data sets that result offer both new
insights and new challenges. A framework of digital atlases will soon offer the
integration of different imaging modalities and permit users to interact with
multidimensional data sets.

To illuminate the function of the thousands of genes that make up the complexity 
of the nervous system, it is critical to be able to introduce and express DNA in 
neurons. Over the past two decades, many gene transfer methods have been
developed, including viral vectors, liposomes and electroporation. Although the
perfect gene transfer technique for every application has not yet been developed,
recent technical advances have facilitated the ease of neuronal gene transfer and
have increased the accessibility of these techniques to all laboratories. In
order to select a transfection method for any particular experiment, the specific
advantages and disadvantages of each technique must be considered.

Lipid rafts are specialized, liquid-ordered subdomains of the plasma membrane.
Through their ability to promote specific compartmentalization of lipids and
membrane proteins, lipid rafts have emerged as membrane platforms specialized for
signal transduction. In recent years, signaling by neurotrophic factors and their
receptors has been shown to depend upon the integrity and function of lipid rafts
and associated components. It has also been shown that these microdomains play
critical roles in selective axon-dendritic sorting and the proteolytic processing
of several neurotrophic ligands and receptors in neuronal cells. The available
evidence supports an important role for lipid rafts in the initiation,
propagation and maintenance of signal transduction events triggered by different 
neurotrophic factors and their receptors in the nervous system.

Receptor complexes for the chemorepellent factors of the semaphorin family
activate intracellular pathways that trigger actin rearrangements underlying
growth cone collapse and repellent behavior. Some evidence has been provided for 
a complex and dynamic pattern of interaction between members of the small Rho
guanosine triphosphatases and plexin proteins that are the receptor subunits
responsible for initiating semaphorin signaling. The characterization of new
components of semaphorin receptor complexes, the implication of several distinct 
classes of cytoplasmic effectors, together with the observation of a variety of
processes modulating the semaphorin signal have provided a basis for a much
improved, but still intricate view of the semaphorin transduction pathways in
neurons.

Neuronal morphological differentiation is regulated by numerous polypeptide
growth factors (neurotrophic factors). Recently, significant progress has been
achieved in clarifying the roles of neurotrophins as well as glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor family members in peripheral axon elongation
during development. Additionally, advances have been made in defining the signal 
transduction mechanisms employed by these factors in mediating axon morphological
responses. Several studies addressed the role of neurotrophic factors in
regenerative axon growth and suggest that signaling mechanisms in addition to
those triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases may be required for successful
peripheral nervous system regeneration. Finally, recent investigations
demonstrate that neurotrophic factors can enhance axon growth after spinal cord
injuries.

The PTEN tumor suppressor gene is a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates
cell survival mediated by the phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinase-protein kinase
B/Akt signaling pathway. Recent in vivo studies have revealed a novel role for
PTEN in the size control of neurons. Dysregulation of cell growth control by PTEN
is associated with the neurological disorder Lhermitte-Duclos disease. PTEN may
regulate cell size through effects on protein translation.

Advances in the study of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have 
provided key insights into the processes of neurotransmission and
neuromodulation. Work in the past year has revealed that Unc-13 and
Rab3a-interacting molecule regulate the conformational state of syntaxin to prime
synaptic vesicle fusion. Analyses of synaptotagmin support its role as a putative
calcium sensor triggering vesicular fusion and highlight the possible role of
SNARE complex oligomerization in the fusion mechanism. Characterization of
endophilin mutants demonstrates that kiss-and-run endocytosis is a major
component of synaptic vesicle recycling. In neuromodulation, dcaps mutants
provide the first genetic insight into possible roles of the CAPS protein in
mediating dense core vesicle fusion and modulating synaptic vesicle fusion.

Genetic approaches in flies and worms continue to dissect the intricate molecular
machinery of chemical synapses. Investigations carried out in the last year
provide important new insights into the development and modulation of the
presynaptic active zones and postsynaptic receptor fields mediating synaptic
function. Mutant screens have identified overlapping gene classes mediating
synaptogenesis. The leucocyte common antigen-related receptor tyrosine
phosphatase interacts with liprin in the formation of the active zone. Spectrins 
are essential for the spatial restriction of synaptic proteins to define active
zones. Glutamate acts as a negative regulator of its cognate postsynaptic
receptor to sculpt receptor field size. Finally, protein translation and
degradation regulation emerge as possible key regulators of synaptic efficacy.

Strasbourg, France. fw-pfrieger@gmx.de

Recent studies suggest that glial cells regulate certain aspects of synapse
development. Neurons can form synapses without glia, but may require glia-derived
cholesterol to form numerous and efficient synapses. During synapse maturation,
soluble and contact-dependent factors from glia may influence the composition of 
the postsynaptic density. Finally, synaptic connections appear to require glia to
support their structural stability. Given the new evidence, it may be time now to
acknowledge glia as a source for synaptogenesis-promoting signals. Scrutinizing
the molecular mechanisms underlying this new function of glia and testing its
relevance in vivo may help to understand how synapses develop and why they
degenerate under pathological conditions.

The architecture and function of the nodes of Ranvier depend on several
specialized cell contacts between the axon and myelinating glial cells. These
sites contain highly organized multimolecular complexes of ion channels and cell 
adhesion molecules, closely connected with the cytoskeleton. Recent findings are 
beginning to reveal how this organization is achieved during the development of
myelinated nerves. The role of membrane proteins involved in axoglial
interactions and of associated cytoplasmic molecules is being elucidated, while
studies of mutant mice have underlined the importance of glial cells and the
specific role of axonal proteins in the organization of axonal domains.

Application of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has
provided several new insights into various olfactory functions. One is that
sniffing and smelling engage separate subsystems in the human olfactory cortex.
Another is that perception of odorous compounds (odorants) is mediated by a set
of core regions, which are partly different for pure olfactory than for olfactory
plus trigeminal odorants. Depending on the task associated with odor perception, 
the core regions are recruited together with other circuits, in a parallel and
hierarchical manner. The sense of smell seems, therefore, to be organized
similarly to other sensory modalities, and the specific psychophysical
characteristics of olfaction should be attributed to an early involvement of the 
limbic system rather than to a conceptually different mode of processing.

The process of gustatory coding consists of neural responses that provide
information about the quantity and quality of food, its generalized sensation,
its hedonic value, and whether it should be swallowed. Many of the models
presently used to analyze gustatory signals are static in that they use the
average neural firing rate as a measure of activity and are unimodal in the sense
they are thought to only involve chemosensory information. We have recently
elaborated upon a dynamic model of gustatory coding that involves interactions
between neurons in single as well as in spatially separate, gustatory and
somatosensory regions. We propose that the specifics of gustatory responses grow 
not only out of information ascending from taste receptor cells, but also from
the cycling of information around a massively interconnected system.

Three complementary approaches demonstrate new types of organization in rodent,
feline and primate auditory cortex, as well as differences in processing between 
auditory and visual cortex. First, connectional work reveals patterns of
thalamocortical and corticocortical input unique to the auditory cortex. Second, 
physiological studies find multiple, interleaved auditory processing modules
related to corticocortical connections and embedded in the isofrequency gradient.
Third, functional analyses demonstrate independent processing streams for sound
localization and identification analogous to the 'what' and 'where' streams in
visual cortex, although the modular arrangements are modality-specific. Taken
together, these data show that the auditory cortex has common and unique
functional substrates.

New neurophysiological results show the existence of multiple transformations of 
color signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) in macaque monkey. These
different color mechanisms may contribute separately to the perception of color
boundaries and colored regions. Many cells in V1 respond to color and to
black-white (luminance) patterns. These neurons are spatially selective and could
provide signals about boundaries between differently colored regions. Other V1
neurons that prefer color over luminance respond without much spatial selectivity
to colored stimuli, and could be the neural basis for the response to local color
modulation within a region. How these different types of color cells combine
inputs from cone photoreceptors is what gives them their different spatial
selectivities for color.

The microcircuitry of the neocortex is bewildering in its anatomical detail, but 
seen through the filters of physiology, some simple circuits have been suggested.
Intensive investigations of the cortical representation of orientation, however, 
show how difficult it is to achieve any consensus on what the circuits are, how
they develop, and how they work. New developments in modeling allied with
powerful experimental tools are changing this. Experimental work combining
optical imaging with anatomy and physiology has revealed a rich local cortical
circuitry. Whereas older models of cortical circuits have concentrated on simple 
'feedforward' circuits, newer theoretical work has explored more the role of the 
recurrent cortical circuits, which are more realistic representations of the
actual circuits and are computationally richer.

Although the response properties of sensory neurons in the thalamus and cerebral 
cortex have been studied for decades, relatively few studies have examined how
sensory information is processed at thalamocortical synapses. Recent studies now 
show that the strength of thalamocortical connections is very dynamic and spike
timing plays an important role in determining whether action potentials will be
transferred from thalamus to cortex.

The neuronal circuitry underlying the generation of direction selectivity in the 
retina has remained elusive for almost 40 years. Recent studies indicate that
direction selectivity may be established within the radial dendrites of
'starburst' amacrine cells and that retinal ganglion cells may acquire their
direction selectivity by the appropriate weighting of excitatory and inhibitory
inputs from starburst dendrites pointing in different directions. If so, this
would require unexpected complexity and subtlety in the synaptic connectivity of 
these CNS neurons.

The relay nuclei of the auditory brainstem contain some of the largest nerve
terminals in the mammalian brain. Endbulb and calyceal synapses convey signals
with a high degree of precision and reliability. However, recent studies reveal
that these synapses possess numerous and remarkably diverse mechanisms for the
modulation of transmitter release. The implication is that successful relay of
signals in vivo may require the ability to fine-tune synaptic transmission.

In the olfactory bulb of vertebrates and the antennal lobe of insects, precise
connections between sensory receptor cells and olfactory glomeruli form the basis
of a highly organized chemotopic map at the first stage of central processing in 
the brain. Beyond this basic level of organization, the olfactory system is
typically separated into two subsystems: a 'main' olfactory pathway that detects 
and processes information about most environmental odorants, and an 'accessory'
olfactory pathway that is devoted to information about social signals such as sex
pheromones. A growing number of studies show, however, that it is not always
possible to draw clear functional distinctions between the two subsystems. These 
findings have led some to speculate that the organizational principles by which
olfactory stimuli are represented across glomeruli may be more similar in these
two olfactory subsystems than previously thought.

The understanding of neuronal processing of olfactory stimuli has been furthered 
by genetic studies and specialized imaging of particular neuronal populations.
Selective optical imaging of odor-induced presynaptic and postsynaptic glomerular
activity in the olfactory bulb/antennal lobe has visualized odorant-responsive
receptor repertoires and shown a more confined odor image at the level of
projection neurons compared to their olfactory receptor neuron input. Genetic
tracing of projection neurons connected to particular glomeruli has revealed a
somewhat dispersed spatial map of termination areas for these neurons both in
insects and in vertebrates. Modifications of the glomerular odor map have
resulted in altered percepts of the corresponding odors.

The elusive transduction channel is the key player in mechanical transduction by 
the sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Multiple factors have thwarted molecular
identification of this channel, including the lack of a definitive
pharmacological signature, the paucity of hair cells, and the uniqueness of their
transduction mechanism. At present, we are forced to speculate as to the
transduction channel's identity; functional characteristics suggest, however,
that it may well belong to transient receptor potential superfamily of ion
channels.

Recent work has addressed the role of vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1) in pain
perception. VR1 activity is regulated both directly and indirectly by endogenous 
factors. For example, protein kinase C sensitizes human VR1 to mild decreases in 
pH, which are commonly encountered during inflammation, and renders the
endocannabinoid anandamide a more potent 'endovanilloid'. Bradykinin and nerve
growth factor release VR1 from the inhibitory control of phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)-bisphosphate and anti-VR1 serum ameliorates thermal allodynia and
hyperalgesia in diabetic mice. There is strong evidence that not only the
sensitivity but also the density of expression of VR1 is enhanced during
inflammatory conditions. These observations provide an empirical foundation which
could explain the reduced inflammatory hyperalgesia in VR1 knockout mice, and
they imply an important role for endovanilloid signaling via VR1 in the
development of ongoing pain in humans that occurs in most inflammatory
conditions. Conversely, downregulation of VR1 expression and/or activity is a
promising therapeutic strategy for novel analgesic drugs.

bitter taste stimuli has opened the door to understanding some of the basic

Circadian rhythms are regulated by clocks located in specific structures of the
central nervous system, such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals, and
by peripheral oscillators present in various other tissues. Recent discoveries
have elucidated the control of central and peripheral clocks by environmental
signals. The major synchroniser in animals is light. In mammals, a subset of
retinal ganglion cells receive light signals that are transmitted to the SCN via 
the retinohypothalamic tract. Photoreception is probably elicited by a novel
opsin, melanopsin, although cryptochromes may also play a role. These signals
feed directly to the SCN master clock, which then provides timing cues to
peripheral clocks. In contrast to mammals, peripheral tissues in the fly and in
the fish are directly photoreceptive. However, alternative routes exist. Some
peripheral clocks in mammals can be specifically entrained in an SCN-independent 
manner by restricting food during the light period.

Recent studies using molecular genetics in mice and dogs, as well as
histopathological analyses of human disease, have come to the same conclusion:
the human sleep disorder narcolepsy is caused by failure of signaling mediated by
orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides. These and other findings strongly suggest that
the orexin system plays a critical role in sleep/wake regulation. In addition,
the orexin system may link energy homeostasis to the regulation of sleep/wake
cycles.

In the past year, knowledge of how information is relayed in the regulation of
circadian rhythms has advanced considerably. Experiments using genetic knockout
animals suggest that circadian photoreception consists of an integration of
multiple signaling pathways. Versatility of clock proteins is seen in terms of
their function in the central pacemakers versus the periphery. This versatility
also extends to previously identified molecules, such as retinoid receptors,
redox factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase, that have newly identified
roles in circadian signaling pathways. Advances in circadian research over the
past year include the common themes of redundancy and plasticity.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, 
Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Recent studies suggest that endocannabinoids act as retrograde messengers at many
synapses in the central nervous system. Activation of phospholipases, either
through calcium-mediated or receptor-mediated signaling, leads to the formation
and release of endocannabinoids. These lipophilic signaling molecules diffuse to 
nearby presynaptic terminals where they bind to specific G-protein-coupled
receptors and inhibit neurotransmitter release for tens of seconds. Thus, an
important physiological role of endocannabinoids may be to provide a mechanism by
which neurons can rapidly regulate the strength of their synaptic inputs.

Investigation of the development of excitability has revealed that cells are
often specialized at early stages to generate Ca(2+) transients. Studies of
excitability have converged on the central role of Ca(2+) and K(+) channels in
the plasmalemma that regulate Ca(2+) influx and have identified critical
functions for receptor-activated channels in the endoplasmic reticulum that allow
efflux of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. The parallels between excitability in
these two locations motivate future work, because comparison of their properties 
identifies shared attributes.

Plasticity at central synapses depends critically on the timing of presynaptic
and postsynaptic action potentials. Key initial steps in synaptic plasticity
involve the back-propagation of action potentials into the dendritic tree and
calcium influx that depends nonlinearly on the action potential and synaptic
input. These initial steps are now better understood. In addition, recent studies
of processes as diverse as gene expression and channel inactivation suggest that 
responses to calcium transients depend not only their amplitude, but on their
time course and on the location of their origin.

Synaptic efficacy, a phenomenon that may underlie long-term memory storage, is
controlled in part by the regulated translation of mRNAs stored in dendrites. The
molecular basis by which specific mRNAs are selected for translation is beginning
to emerge and appears to involve at least one mechanism that helps program early 
metazoan development. Because different neural transmitters elicit different
synaptic responses that rely on local protein synthesis, a number of
sequence-specific mRNA translational regulatory mechanisms are likely to function
in neurons. Such mechanisms may be inferred from those operating in early
development and in cognitive disease.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is thought to be a
critical mediator of neuronal plasticity that links transiently triggered Ca(2+) 
signals to persistent changes in neuronal physiology. In one of its roles, CaMKII
is an essential player in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated increase in 
conductance at glutamatergic synapses, a process described as long-term
potentiation, which serves as a common model for neuronal plasticity and memory. 
Recent studies have used genetic, biochemical, live cell imaging and mathematical
modeling approaches to investigate neuronal CaMKII and have led to a model of the
molecular steps of CaMKII translocation and activation that can explain its role 
in neuronal plasticity.

Channels and receptors on the cell surface mediate neuronal signaling. It is
therefore important to understand how their surface density is controlled. Recent
studies on the trafficking of potassium channels and neurotransmitter receptors
have revealed unexpected complexity in the regulation of transport from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, raising the possibility that the
surface composition of channels and receptors may be adjusted by controlling
their export from the endoplasmic reticulum.

Newly discovered features of the trafficking of AMPA receptors to and from the
postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses are now bringing the mechanisms of
synaptic plasticity into focus. Recent advances, including the existence of
slots, anchors, transport factors and pathways for activity-dependent control,
have elucidated the role of the individual AMPA receptor subunits and their
binding partners. The latest views describe how subunit type dictates the
assembly of heteromeric receptors, and how these heteromers interact with the
receptor trafficking machinery and synaptic anchorage factors. Moreover,
phosphorylation may play an important role in receptor transport and synaptic
turnover.

Biochemical signaling pathways are known to have a critical role in neuronal
development and function. A growing body of evidence is accumulating to suggest
that signaling pathways also underlie neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative
disease. One pathway with a prominent role in neurodegenerative disease is the
signaling pathway in which the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a key 
component. In vitro and in vivo evidence point to a key role for GSK3 in
promoting neurodegeneration and in Alzheimer's disease plaque and neurofibrillary
tangle formation. How GSK3 acts in this regard is still open to debate, but it
may involve both extracellular and nuclear apoptotic activities.

Target-derived neurotrophins are required for the growth and survival of
innervating neurons. When released by postsynaptic targets, neurotrophins bind
receptors (Trks) on nerve terminals. Activated Trks signal locally within distal 
axons and retrogradely through long axons to distant cell bodies in order to
promote gene expression and survival. Although the mechanism of retrograde
neurotrophin signaling is not fully elucidated, considerable evidence supports a 
model in which the vesicular transport of neurotrophin-Trk complexes transmits a 
survival signal that involves PI3K and Erk5. Other, non-vesicular modes of
retrograde signaling are likely to function in parallel. Recent studies highlight
the importance of the location of stimulation as a determinant of Trk signaling. 
Defects in signaling from distal axons to cell bodies may be causally related to 
neurodegenerative disorders.

The neurotrophins utilize a complex receptor system consisting of Trk receptor
tyrosine kinases and the structurally unrelated tumor necrosis factor receptor
family member, p75(NTR), to confer diverse and sometimes opposing biological
actions. The recent identification of selective ligands for p75(NTR), novel
isoforms of this receptor, as well as new signaling partners, suggest that the
numerous biological actions of the neurotrophins via p75(NTR) may reflect
selectivity of ligand-receptor interactions and intracellular adaptor protein
recruitment.

The generation of a functional neuronal network requires that axons navigate
precisely to their appropriate targets. Molecules that specify guidance decisions
have been identified, and the signaling events that occur downstream of guidance 
receptors are beginning to be understood. New research shows that guidance
receptor signaling can be hierarchical -- one receptor silencing the other --
thereby allowing navigating growth cones to interpret opposing guidance cues.
Among the known intracellular signaling molecules shared by all guidance receptor
families, Rho GTPases appear to be primary regulators of actin dynamics and
growth cone guidance. Novel effector molecules complete the picture and suggest
additional signaling mechanisms.

The sequential appearance of neurons and glia in the vertebrate central nervous
system may be governed by competition between growth factor signaling pathways
and downstream transcription factors. In cortical progenitor cell cultures, the
proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Ngn1 suppresses formation
of astrocytes by sequestering coactivator proteins that are required by signal
transducers and activators of transcription for the expression of
astrocyte-specific genes. In the developing neural tube, combinatorial
interactions between the proneural transcription factor Ngn2 and the basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 specify the formation of motor
neurons or oligodendrocytes.

The most distinctive attribute of long-term memory is persistence over time. New 
studies have uncovered many aspects of the molecular and cellular biology of
synaptic plasticity, and the acquisition and consolidation of memory, which are
thought to depend on synaptic plasticity. Much less, however, is known about the 
molecular and cellular biology of long-term memory persistence. Recent findings
in the field are construed within the conceptual framework that proposes that
consolidation and persistence of long-term memories require modulation of gene
expression, which can culminate in synaptic remodeling. Whether modulation of
gene expression, and particularly the ensuing morphological plasticity of the
synapse, is permissive, causal or sufficient for the materialization and
persistence of the long-term trace is, as yet, undetermined. How persistent is
persistence? Renewed interest is focused on the possibility that some long-term
memories consolidate anew with retrieval, and could, under certain conditions,
become transiently shaky in this period of reconsolidation.

Recent animal studies reveal ascending nociceptive and descending modulatory
pathways that may contribute to the affective-motivational aspects of pain and
play a critical role in the modulation of pain. In humans, a reliable pattern of 
cerebral activity occurs during the subjective experience of pain. Activity
within the anterior cingulate cortex and possibly in other classical limbic
structures, appears to be closely related to the subjective experience of pain
unpleasantness and may reflect the regulation of endogenous mechanisms of pain
modulation.

Attentional selection involves brain processes that select and control the flow
of information into the mechanisms that underlie perception and consciousness.
One theory proposes that the neural activity that represents the stimuli or
events to be attended to is selected through modification of its synchrony.
Recent experimental evidence supports this theory, by showing that changes in
attentional focus increase the synchrony of neural firing in some neuron pairs
and decrease it in others.

The limited capacity of neural processing restricts the number of objects and
locations that can be attended to. Selected events are readily enhanced: the
bright side of attention. However, such focal processing comes at a cost, namely,
functional blindness for unattended events: the dark side of visual attention.
Recent work has advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms that
facilitate visual processing, as well as the neural correlates of unattended,
unconscious visual events. Also, new results have revealed how attentional
deployment is optimized by non-visual factors such as behavioral set, past
experience, and emotional salience.

Developmental dyslexics, individuals with an unexplained difficulty reading, have
been shown to have deficits in phonological processing -- the awareness of the
sound structure of words -- and, in some cases, a more fundamental deficit in
rapid auditory processing. In addition, dyslexics show a disruption in white
matter connectivity between posterior and frontal regions. These results give
continued support for a neurobiological etiology of developmental dyslexia.
However, more research will be required to determine the possible causal
relationships between these neurobiological disruptions and dyslexia.

Recognition of emotion draws on a distributed set of structures that include the 
occipitotemporal neocortex, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and right
frontoparietal cortices. Recognition of fear may draw especially on the amygdala 
and the detection of disgust may rely on the insula and basal ganglia. Two
important mechanisms for recognition of emotions are the construction of a
simulation of the observed emotion in the perceiver, and the modulation of
sensory cortices via top-down influences.

Recent data show that the ventral premotor cortex in both humans and monkeys has 
motor and cognitive functions. The cognitive functions include space perception, 
action understanding and imitation. The data also show a clear functional

that the ventral part of the lateral premotor cortex in humans may correspond to 
monkey area F4. A tentative map of the human lateral premotor areas founded on
the reviewed evidence is presented.

Once considered the province of philosophy and the behavioral sciences, the
process of making decisions has received increasing scrutiny from
neurobiologists. Recent research suggests that sensory judgements unfold through 
the gradual accumulation of neuronal signals in sensory-motor pathways, favoring 
one alternative over others. Stored representations of the outcome of prior
actions activate neurons in many of these same areas during decision-making. The 
challenge for neurobiologists lies in deciphering how signals from these
disparate areas are integrated to form a single behavioral choice and the
mechanisms responsible for selecting the appropriate information upon which
decisions should be informed in particular contexts.

Recent single-neuron recordings show that representation of the external
environment in the parietal lobe is highly selective for objects that are
immediately relevant to behavior. Parietal neurons change their selectivity in
accordance to immediate behavioral needs, integrate evidence about behavioral
relevance from multiple sources, and appear to actively participate in the
selection of potential behavioral targets. The selective parietal representations
may represent a general-purpose attentional mechanism that can simultaneously
specify targets for exploratory movements and for perception.

Direct viral infection of the developing brain can have disastrous consequences
for the fetus. More subtle and perhaps more insidious are viral infections of the
pregnant mother, which can have long-lasting effects such as an increased risk of
schizophrenia in the offspring. A recent mouse model has shown that respiratory
infection in the pregnant mother leads to marked behavioral and pharmacological
abnormalities in the offspring, some of which are relevant for schizophrenia and 
autism. This effect on fetal brain development might be caused by the maternal
antiviral immune response, possibly mediated by cytokines.

New approaches to the study of ocular dominance development, a model system for
the development of neural architecture, indicate that eye-specific columns in
primary visual cortex emerge substantially before the onset of the critical
period, during which neural connections can be altered by visual experience. The 
timing, speed and specificity of column emergence implicate molecular patterning 
mechanisms, along with patterns of neural activity, in the generation of this
columnar architecture.

Recent studies challenge the view that signals provided by motor neurons are
required to activate subsynaptic nuclei and induce postsynaptic specializations
in developing skeletal muscle. New findings show that acetylcholine receptor
genes are expressed and that acetylcholine receptor clusters form preferentially 
in the prospective synaptic region of muscle independently of motor innervation. 
These results indicate that developing myotubes are patterned by mechanisms
intrinsic to developing muscles and raise the possibility that patterning of
muscles may influence the growth pattern of motor axons and the sites where
synapses form.

It is now 15 years since the discovery that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
activity is required to maintain the refined topographic organization of
retinotectal projections. Recent studies have identified additional components of
the signaling pathways required for activity-dependent map formation and
maintenance. Nitric oxide and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, candidate
retrograde messengers, and serotonin and acetylcholine, modulators of neuronal
excitability, all affect mapping. These studies indicate that the mapping process
intersects with other processes fundamental to visual system development and
function, such as process outgrowth, synaptic turnover and neuromodulation.

Synapse formation is the ultimate step in wiring a nervous system. Synapses are
remarkably diverse in size and shape, and are regulated dynamically. Recently,
live observations combined with ultrastructural analysis have revealed many
details of the cellular interactions that precede synapse formation. Genetic
screens in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila have implicated signaling
pathways that may involve small G-proteins, ubiquitin-mediated protein
degradation and selective cell adhesion in target recognition, synaptic assembly 
and growth.

Notch signaling allows cells in contact to adopt different fates. Regulation of
the Notch pathway allows for the same signaling mechanism to be used in a wide
variety of contexts during development. Intracellular activities of the E3
ubiquitin ligases Sel-10 and Neuralized involve proteasome-dependent degradation 
in the regulation of Notch pathway activity. Extracellular manipulations of Notch
by Fringe and Scabrous regulate the pathway by changing Notch interactions
outside the cell. These regulatory mechanisms, along with many others, affect how
Notch signaling activity influences cell fate determination.

Signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) controls important developmental processes,
including dorsoventral neural tube patterning, neural stem cell proliferation,
and neuronal and glial cell survival. Shh signaling involves lipid modifications 
to Shh itself, as well as changes in protein subcellular localization. Recent

its potency and migration capacity. Subsequent trafficking and organelle sorting 
in the Shh signaling pathway have been observed; these observations offer a new
dimension to our understanding of downstream signal transduction events.

Recent studies have provided insights into the neurodevelopmental functions of
thyroid hormone signaling. The nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are
ligand-activated transcription factors and a variety of TR isotypes, generated by
two genes, mediate distinct processes. In addition, deiodinase enzymes that
regulate levels of the main active form of thyroid hormone, T3, are likely to
cooperate closely with TRs in specifying a localized and timely response to
thyroid hormones in target tissues. Some of the most sensitive processes
controlled by these pathways are in the auditory and visual sensory systems.

include the specification of positional identity, the proliferation of neural
stem cells and their commitment to a neuronal or glial fate, and the
differentiation of layer-specific neuronal phenotypes in the cerebral cortex.

genetic regulation, intrinsic to the dorsal telencephalon, control the gradual

arealization, implicating the transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6 in the direct
control of area identities; and the demonstration of the potential role of the
signaling protein, fibroblast growth factor 8, in the early patterning of
arealization genes, such as Emx2.

Cellular processes that mediate learning and memory show a remarkable level of
conservation between vertebrates and invertebrates. Recent studies have shown
that learning and memory formation in invertebrates, so-called 'simple systems', 
involves a highly complex arrangement of cellular pathways. Some pathways
contribute to a single stage of memory formation, whereas others impact on
multiple stages of memory development. Distinct cellular pathways may also act in
series or in parallel during various stages of memory formation.

The hippocampus and caudate nucleus are anatomical components of relatively
independent memory systems and recent research has focused on the nature of the
interaction between these two systems. The amygdala exerts a general modulatory
influence on memory storage processes related, in part, to an organism's level of
affective or emotional arousal. Moreover, affective state can influence the use
of different memory systems, and the amygdala may mediate this effect of emotion 
on memory. Recent evidence indicates that the amygdala modulates the separate
types of memory mediated by the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Recent human
brain imaging studies also point to both sex- and hemisphere-related asymmetries 
in amygdala participation in emotionally influenced memory.

oscillation that is prominent in rat hippocampus during locomotion, orienting and
other voluntary behaviors - in synaptic plasticity, information coding and the
function of working memory. Intracranial recordings from human cortex have
revealed evidence of high-amplitude theta oscillations throughout the brain,

observation of human theta has begun to reveal an intriguing connection between
brain oscillations and cognitive processes.

Precise temporal coding is a hallmark of both the electrosensory and auditory
systems. Selective pressures to improve accuracy or encode more rapid changes
have produced a suite of convergent physiological and morphological features that

improve coding.

The ethological approach has already provided rich insights into the auditory
neurobiology of a number of different taxa (e.g. birds, frogs and insects).
Understanding the ethology of primates is likely to yield similar insights into

Now that recordings of multiple, individual action potentials are being made with
chronic electrodes, it seems that previous work showing simple encoding of
movement parameters in these spike trains can be used as a real-time control
signal for prosthetic arms. Efficient extraction algorithms can compensate for
the limited ensemble sample acquired with this emerging technology.

The rhythmic mandible-generated close-open alternations of the mouth, responsible
for the series of consonant-vowel alternations characteristic of babbling and of 
languages, is receiving increased attention as a possible manifestation of an
ontogenetic and phylogenetic 'frame' underlying the serial organization of
speech. The supplementary motor area appears important for production of this
consonant-vowel frame in adults.

The Albin-DeLong 'box and arrow' model has long been the accepted standard model 
for the basal ganglia network. However, advances in physiological and anatomical 
research have enabled a more detailed neural network approach. Recent
computational models hold that the basal ganglia use reinforcement signals and
local competitive learning rules to reduce the dimensionality of sparse cortical 
information. These models predict a steady-state situation with diminished
efficacy of lateral inhibition and low synchronization. In this framework,
Parkinson's disease can be characterized as a persistent state of negative
reinforcement, inefficient dimensionality reduction, and abnormally synchronized 
basal ganglia activity.

Recent single-unit recording studies have clarified how multiple parameters of
movement are signaled by individual cortical and cerebellar neurons, and also
that multiple coordinate frames are utilized. Cognitive processes also modulate
the firing of these neurons. The various signals and coordinate systems vary in
time and evolve throughout a behavioral sequence, consistent with the demands of 
the task and the required sensorimotor transformations.

Recent imaging studies of motor function provide new insights into the
organization of the premotor areas of the frontal lobe. The pre-supplementary
motor area and the rostral portion of the dorsal premotor cortex, the 'pre-PMd', 
are, in many respects, more like prefrontal areas than motor areas. Recent data
also suggest the existence of separate functional divisions in the rostral
cingulate zone.

New concepts and computational models that integrate behavioral and
neurophysiological observations have addressed several of the most fundamental
long-standing problems in motor control. These problems include the selection of 
particular trajectories among the large number of possibilities, the solution of

The analysis of complex human diseases has been spurred by the number of
published genomic sequence variants - many identified in the course of sequencing
the human genome. But, to be useful for genetic analysis, variants have to be
mapped accurately, their frequencies in various populations determined, and
automated high-throughput assay techniques developed. Recently proposed methods
address these issues: the use of 'reduced representation shotgun' methods for
more efficient detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the
employment of high-throughput genotyping techniques, the development of SNP maps 
that incorporate information about linkage disequilibrium, and the use of SNPs in
identifying susceptibility genes for common illnesses.

because of the complexity of the central nervous system and the availability of
resources. Nevertheless, recent studies using DNA chips have made inroads into
the molecular characterization of regional and functional brain units, the

protein targets in biological systems, including the neurological system.

Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been engineered to produce an optical report in
response to cellular signals. FP fluorescence can be made directly sensitive to
the chemical environment, via specific mutations of or around the chromophore.
Alternatively, FPs can be made indirectly sensitive to cellular signals by their 
fusion to 'detector' proteins that respond to specific cellular signals with
structural rearrangements that act on the FP to alter fluorescence. These optical
sensors of membrane voltage, neurotransmitter release, and intracellular
messengers, including powerful new sensors of Ca(2+), cyclic nucleotides and
nitric oxide, are likely to provide new insights into the workings of cellular
signals and of information processing in neural circuits.

Progress has been made in characterizing the secretases involved in
endoproteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein - the precursor 
of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is the main constituent of amyloid
plaques that form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is now
thought that Abeta is pivotal in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and
that reducing brain Abeta levels may help to treat or prevent the disease. Two
essential factors for the proteolytic generation of Abeta have been identified,
beta-secretase and the presenilins, which might aid the design of drugs against
this disease.

Immediate early genes have gained widespread use as neural activity markers in
studies of brain function. The recent development of cellular compartment
analysis of temporal activity, which combines sensitive fluorescence in situ
hybridization and laser scanning confocal microscopy, overcomes the lack of
temporal resolution of standard methodologies and allows the tracking of distinct
steps in the synthesis and processing of immediate early gene RNAs. Thus, this
technique provides information about when individual neurons are activated and
allows the visualization, within a single brain, of different neuronal
populations engaged by two distinct experiences.

It is becoming evident that neurons express an unusual number of molecules that
were originally thought to be specific to immune functions. One such molecule,
class I major histocompatibility complex, is required in the activity-dependent
refinement and plasticity of connections in the developing and adult central
nervous system, demonstrating that molecules can perform critical roles in both
systems. Recent studies reveal striking parallels between cellular signaling
mechanisms in the immune and nervous systems that may provide unexpected insights
into the development, function, and diseases of both systems.

The molecular mechanisms that generate efficient and directed transport of
proteins and organelles in axons remain poorly understood. In the past year, many
studies have identified specific transmembrane or scaffold proteins that might
link motor proteins to their cargoes. These studies have also identified
previously unsuspected pathways and raised the intriguing possibility that
pre-packaged groups of functionally related proteins are transported together in 
the axon. Evidence suggests that fast molecular motor proteins have a role in
slow axonal transport, and the axonal transport machinery has been implicated in 
the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Of the few animal groups that learn their vocalizations, songbirds are uniquely
amenable to molecular, physiological, and behavioral analyses of the neural
features responsible for vocal learning. In order to communicate effectively as
an adult, a young songbird recognizes and memorizes a model of his
species-specific song during a developmentally critical period called sensory
acquisition. Factors are now emerging that contribute to the length and strength 
of this learning phase. In a second critical period, known as sensorimotor
learning, the young bird uses auditory feedback to perfect his motor performance,
creating a match to the memorized model. New studies show that motor matching can
persist beyond sensorimotor learning, and thus a role for the acquired model
might also persist into adulthood. Fascinating in their own right, songbirds also
provide optimism that mature brains have recourse to plasticity.

Historically, perception has been viewed as a modular function, with the
different sensory modalities operating independently of each other. Recent
behavioral and brain imaging studies challenge this view, by suggesting that
cross-modal interactions are the rule and not the exception in perception, and
that the cortical pathways previously thought to be sensory-specific are
modulated by signals from other modalities.

Recent experimental and theoretical results in cat primary visual cortex and in
the whisker-barrel fields of rodent primary somatosensory cortex suggest common
organizing principles for layer 4, the primary recipient of sensory input from
the thalamus. Response tuning of layer 4 cells is largely determined by a local
interplay of feed-forward excitation (directly from the thalamus) and inhibition 
(from layer 4 inhibitory interneurons driven by the thalamus). Feed-forward
inhibition dominates excitation, inherits its tuning from the thalamic input, and
sharpens the tuning of excitatory cells. Recurrent excitation enhances responses 
to effective stimuli.

Adaptive processing of electrosensory information occurs in the cerebellum-like
structures of three distinct groups of fish. Associations within each of these
structures result in the generation of negative images of predictable features of
the sensory inflow. Addition of these negative images to the actual inflow
removes the predictable features, allowing the unpredictable, information-rich
sensory signals to stand out. Evidence from all three groups of fish indicates
that the negative images are mediated by plasticity at parallel fiber synapses.

Orientation, navigation, and homing are critical traits expressed by organisms
ranging from bacteria through higher vertebrates. Sensory systems that aid such
behavior have provided key selective advantages to these groups over the past 4
billion years, and are highly evolved; magnetoreception is no exception. Across
many species and groups of organisms, compelling evidence exists that the
physical basis of this response is tiny crystals of single-domain magnetite
(Fe3O4). It is the opinion of the authors that all magnetic field sensitivity in 
living organisms, including elasmobranch fishes, is the result of a highly
evolved, finely-tuned sensory system based on single-domain, ferromagnetic
crystals.

Combined psychophysical and neurophysiological research has resulted in a
relatively complete picture of the neural mechanisms of tactile perception. The
results support the idea that each of the four mechanoreceptive afferent systems 
innervating the hand serves a distinctly different perceptual function, and that 
tactile perception can be understood as the sum of these functions. Furthermore, 
the receptors in each of those systems seem to be specialized for their assigned 
perceptual function.

It is now established that the mammalian cochlea uses active amplification of
incoming sound to achieve sensitivity. Cellular details are emerging slowly.
Recent studies of sensory hair cells have highlighted the possible molecular
bases for amplification and the components of sensitivity regulation within the
cochlea: a synthesis is likely to depend on effective and physiologically
informed modelling.

Natural visual stimuli have been reported to evoke neural responses with brief,
intense firing events. This has important implications for how visual information
is encoded. A recent experiment measured the responses of visual neurons in the
natural environment, circumventing many limitations of laboratory simulations
while still retaining tight experimental control. Under these conditions, neurons
fired intensely at precise, discrete times, validating that this firing regime is
relevant to natural vision.

The listing of cell types present in the retina is nearing completion, the first 
time this can be said for any significantly complex sample of the central nervous
system. Mammalian retinas contain approximately 55 separate neuronal types. The
functions of 22 of them are known or can be strongly inferred. For these 22, in
every instance, a cell defined as a 'type' by structural criteria carries out a
distinct and individual physiological function. Electrophysiological experiments 
continue to reveal new features of the retina's handling of information, and
there is every reason to believe that the remaining 33 types of cell will also
have distinct physiological functions. Further subtleties clearly exist in both
peripheral and central visual coding.

The use of methods from contemporary nonlinear dynamics in studying neurobiology 
has been rather limited.Yet, nonlinear dynamics has become a practical tool for
analyzing data and verifying models. This has led to productive coupling of
nonlinear dynamics with experiments in neurobiology in which the neural circuits 
are forced with constant stimuli, with slowly varying stimuli, with periodic
stimuli, and with more complex information-bearing stimuli. Analysis of these
more complex stimuli of neural circuits goes to the heart of how one is to
understand the encoding and transmission of information by nervous systems.

Information in nervous systems is often carried by neural ensembles--groups of
neurons in transient functional linkage--and written in a code that involves the 
spatial locations of active neurons or synapses and the times at which activity
occurs. Even in favorable neuroanatomical circumstances, studying neural ensemble
function presents a serious experimental challenge. One recent strategy to
overcome this challenge relies on protein-based sensors that provide direct
optical images of neural activity, and on protein-based effectors that interfere 
with it. Because these molecules are encodable in DNA, they can be introduced
into intact animals by genetic manipulation, and their expression pattern can be 
tailored to include--exclusively and at the same time comprehensively--the
neurons of interest. Circumscribed populations of neurons can thus be studied in 
virtual isolation at defined stages of intact neural pathways.

Glial cells are active partners of neurons in processing information and synaptic
integration. They receive coded signals from synapses and elaborate modulatory
responses. The active properties of glia, including long-range signalling and
regulated transmitter release, are beginning to be elucidated. Recent insights
suggest that the active brain should no longer be regarded as a circuitry of
neuronal contacts, but as an integrated network of interactive neurons and glia.

Synaptic transmission of distinct patterns of spikes, or 'neural code', leads to 
plastic changes in synapses and other parts of the neuron, as well as learning in
animals. Recent findings indicate that specialized multiprotein structures
associated with neurotransmitter receptors and cell-adhesion proteins function as
molecular devices that both read the neural code and initiate long-term changes
in synaptic structure and function.

Recent studies aimed at identifying the mechanisms that regulate the signaling of
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have revealed that both protein kinase 
and protein phosphatase activity are important in directly modulating mGluR
function. The inter-relationship between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of
mGluRs seems to be an important determinant in regulating mGluR function and the 
subsequent neuromodulatory events elicited by activation of mGluRs.

Dendritic spines are cellular microcompartments that are isolated from their
parent dendrites and neighboring spines. Recently, imaging studies of spine
Ca(2+) dynamics have revealed that Ca(2+) can enter spines through
voltage-sensitive and ligand-activated channels, as well as through Ca(2+)
release from intracellular stores. Relationships between spine Ca(2+) signals and
induction of various forms of synaptic plasticity are beginning to be elucidated.
Measurements of spine Ca(2+) concentration are also being used to probe the
properties of single synapses and even individual calcium channels in their
native environment.

Dendrites of cortical neurons possess active conductances, which contribute to
the nonlinear processing of synaptic information. Recently it has been shown that
basal dendrites can generate highly localized spikes mediated by NMDA receptor
channels. These spikes may serve as a powerful mechanism to detect and amplify
synchronously activated spatially clustered excitatory synaptic inputs in
individual dendritic segments, and may enable parallel processing in several
integrative dendritic subunits.

Regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors is one of the main mechanisms for 
altering synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. Recent studies have
given insight into the upregulation of the NMDA receptor by Src family tyrosine
kinases, which bind to scaffolding proteins in the NMDA receptor complex. Src
acts as a common step in signalling cascades that link G-protein-coupled
receptors with protein kinase C via the intermediary cell-adhesion kinase beta.
This signalling to NMDA receptors is required for long-term potentiation in the
CA1 region of the hippocampus.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are present at many excitatory glutamate 
synapses in the central nervous system and display unique properties that depend 
on their subunit composition. Biophysical, pharmacological and molecular methods 
have been used to determine the key features conferred by the various NMDAR
subunits, and have helped to establish which NMDAR subtypes are present at
particular synapses. Recent studies are beginning to address the functional
significance of NMDAR diversity under normal and pathological conditions.

Recent work has established that different geometric arrangements of calcium
channels are found at different presynaptic terminals, leading to a wide spectrum
of calcium signals for triggering neurotransmitter release. These calcium signals
are apparently transduced by synaptotagmins - calcium-binding proteins found in
synaptic vesicles. New biochemical results indicate that all synaptotagmins
undergo calcium-dependent interactions with membrane lipids and a number of other
presynaptic proteins, but which of these interactions is responsible for
calcium-triggered transmitter release remains unclear.

Ca(2+) has a central role in coupling synaptic activity and transcriptional
responses. Recent studies have focused on Ca(2+)-dependent nuclear mechanisms
that bring to the nucleosomal level cascades of events initiated in the

interaction between a calcium sensor and DNA has been shown to regulate
transcription directly.

Different intracellular pools participate in generating Ca(2+) signals in
neuronal cells and in shaping their spatio-temporal patterns. They include the
endoplasmic reticulum (endowed with different classes of Ca(2+) channels, with
distinct functional properties and highly defined expression patterns in the
brain), the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria. The release of Ca(2+) from
intracellular pools plays an important role in controlling processes such as
neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, secretion and neurodegeneration.

The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating survival
signals in a wide range of neuronal cell types. The recent identification of a
number of substrates for the serine/threonine kinase Akt suggests that it blocks 
cell death by both impinging on the cytoplasmic cell death machinery and by
regulating the expression of genes involved in cell death and survival. In
addition, recent experiments suggest that Akt may also use metabolic pathways to 
regulate cell survival.

The neuregulins are a complex family of factors that perform many functions
during neural development. Recent experiments have shown that neuregulins promote
neuronal migration and differentiation, and regulate the selective expression of 
neurotransmitter receptors in neurons and at the neuromuscular junction. They
also regulate glial commitment, proliferation, survival and differentiation. At
interneuronal synapses, neuregulin ErbB receptors associate with PDZ-domain
proteins at postsynaptic densities where they can modulate synaptic plasticity.
How this combinatorial network - comprising many neuregulin ligands that signal
through distinct combinations of dimeric ErbB receptors - elicits its multitude
of biological effects is beginning to be resolved.

The four mammalian neurotrophins - NGF, BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4 - each bind and
activate one or more of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Through
these receptors, neurotrophins activate many intracellular signaling pathways,
including those controlled by Ras, the Cdc42/Rac/RhoG protein family, MAPK, PI3K 
and PLC-gamma, thereby affecting both development and function of the nervous
system. During the past two years, several novel signaling pathways controlled by
Trk receptors have been characterized, and it has become clear that membrane
transport and sorting controls Trk-receptor-mediated signaling because key
intermediates are localized to different membrane compartments. Three-dimensional
structures of the Trk receptors, in one instance in association with a
neurotrophin, have revealed the structural bases underlying specificity in
neurotrophin signaling.

Cognitive deficits associated with the chronic abuse of drugs have important
theoretical and clinical significance: such deficits reflect changes to the
underlying cortical, sub-cortical and neuromodulatory mechanisms that underpin
cognition, and also interfere directly with rehabilitative programs. Recent
investigations have been made into the neuropsychology of chronic abuse of
cannabis, stimulants and opiates. It is suggested that future progress in this
area, involving developing advances in brain-imaging and neuropharmacology, will 
capitalize on experimental demonstrations of specific patterns of impairments in 
decision-making, attention and memory function.

Neuroimaging technology has provided unprecedented opportunities for elucidating 
the anatomical correlates of major depression. The knowledge gained from imaging 
research and from the postmortem studies that have been guided by imaging data is
catalyzing a paradigm shift in which primary mood disorders are conceptualized as
illnesses that involve abnormalities of brain structure, as well as of brain
function. These data suggest specific hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms 
underlying pathological emotional processing in mood disorders. They particularly
support a role for dysfunction within the prefrontal cortical and striatal
systems that normally modulate limbic and brainstem structures involved in
mediating emotional behavior in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms.

Recent studies have begun to elucidate the roles played in social cognition by
specific neural structures, genes, and neurotransmitter systems. Cortical regions
in the temporal lobe participate in perceiving socially relevant stimuli, whereas
the amygdala, right somatosensory cortices, orbitofrontal cortices, and cingulate
cortices all participate in linking perception of such stimuli to motivation,
emotion, and cognition. Open questions remain about the domain-specificity of
social cognition, about its overlap with emotion and with communication, and
about the methods best suited for its investigation.

The human brain is a set of computational machines, each of which was designed by
natural selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our hunter-gatherer
ancestors. These machines are adaptive specializations: systems equipped with
design features that are organized such that they solve an ancestral problem
reliably, economically and efficiently. The search for functionally specialized
computational adaptations has now begun in earnest. A host of specialized systems
have recently been found, including ones designed for sexual motivation, social
inference, judgment under uncertainty and conditioning, as well as content-rich
systems for visual recognition and knowledge acquisition.

Recent neuroimaging studies in adults indicate that visual areas selective for
recognition of faces can be recruited through expertise for nonface objects. This
reflects a new emphasis on experience in theories of visual specialization. In
addition, novel work infers differences between categories of nonface objects,
allowing a re-interpretation of differences seen between recognition of faces and
objects. Whether there are experience-independent precursors of face expertise
remains unclear; indeed, parallels between literature for infants and adults
suggest that methodological issues need to be addressed before strong conclusions
can be drawn regarding the origins of face recognition.

Over the past seven years, the main advances in our understanding of infant
development have involved the application of cognitive neuroscience methods such 
as neuroimaging and computer modelling. Results obtained using these methods have
illuminated further the complex interactions between nature and nurture that
underlie early postnatal development.

It has been demonstrated that the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI
initial dip allows us to resolve (without differential subtraction) structures of
the order of 0.5 mm. However, recent results support the proposition that even
the later, positive BOLD fMRI signal component can allow us to resolve structures
less than 1 mm in size by using differential subtraction when the signal-to-noise
ratio is high. So, with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, the later, positive
component should be useable as a probe for testing cognitive neuroscientific
hypotheses that predict neuroanatomical dissociations of less than 1mm.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography
measure local changes in brain hemodynamics induced by cognitive or perceptual
tasks. These measures have a uniformly high spatial resolution of millimeters or 
less, but poor temporal resolution (about 1s). Conversely, electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure instantaneously the current flows 
induced by synaptic activity, but the accurate localization of these current
flows based on EEG and MEG data alone remains an unsolved problem. Recently,
techniques have been developed that, in the context of brain anatomy visualized
with structural MRI, use both hemodynamic and electromagnetic measures to arrive 
at estimates of brain activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. These
methods range from simple juxtaposition to simultaneous integrated techniques.
Their application has already led to advances in our understanding of the neural 
bases of perception, attention, memory and language. Further advances in
multi-modality integration will require an improved understanding of the coupling
between the physiological phenomena underlying the different signal modalities.

Recent functional brain imaging studies suggest that object concepts may be
represented, in part, by distributed networks of discrete cortical regions that
parallel the organization of sensory and motor systems. In addition, different
regions of the left lateral prefrontal cortex, and perhaps anterior temporal
cortex, may have distinct roles in retrieving, maintaining and selecting semantic
information.

The perirhinal cortex plays a key role in acquiring knowledge about objects. It
contributes to at least four cognitive functions, and recent findings provide new
insights into how the perirhinal cortex contributes to each: first, it
contributes to recognition memory in an automatic fashion; second, it probably
contributes to perception as well as memory; third, it helps identify objects by 
associating together the different sensory features of an object; and fourth, it 
associates objects with other objects and with abstractions.

Memory is often considered to be a process that has several stages, including
acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Memory can be modified further through 
reconsolidation and performance can change during extinction trials while the
original memory remains intact. Recent studies of the molecular basis of these
processes have found that many signaling molecules are involved in several stages
of memory but, in some cases, molecular pathways may be selectively recruited
only during certain stages of memory.

In forming a representation of a visible object, the brain must analyze the
visual scene pre-attentively, select an object through active attention, and form
representations of the multiple attributes of the selected object. During the
past two years, progress has been made in understanding the neural underpinnings 
of these processes by means of single-neuron recording in monkeys.

Recent studies have presented evidence that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial
role in every aspect of the cognitive processes necessary for behavioral
planning: processing and integration of perceived or memorized information,
associative learning, reward-based behavioral control, behavioral
selection/decision-making and behavioral guidance. We propose that the creation
of novel information is the means by which the prefrontal cortex operates to
achieve executive control over behavioral planning. The prefrontal cortex is the 
site of operation of nodal points, where neural circuits integrate currently
available or memorized information to generate the information that is necessary 
to perform an action. The prefrontal cortex also regulates the flow of
information through multiple nodes to meet behavioral demands.

Functional neuroimaging has proven highly valuable in mapping human sensory
regions, particularly visual areas in occipital cortex. Recent evidence suggests 
that human parietal cortex may also consist of numerous specialized subregions
similar to those reported in neurophysiological studies of non-human primates.
However, parietal activation generalizes across a wide variety of cognitive tasks
and the extension of human brain mapping into higher-order "association cortex"
may prove to be a challenge.

The immediacy and directness of our visual experience belies the complexity of
the underlying neural mechanisms, which remain incompletely understood. Recent
neuroimaging studies suggest that activity in ventral visual cortex is necessary 
but not sufficient for visual awareness. Experiments in both patients and normal 
subjects indicate that parietal and frontal areas make an important contribution 
to visual awareness, suggesting that reciprocal interactions between dorsal
frontoparietal areas and ventral visual cortex may provide a fundamental neural
substrate for conscious visual experience.

In vivo studies indicate that synaptic activity promotes dendritic arbor

synaptic activity stabilizes dendritic structure. The different roles of synaptic

Dendritic patterning exerts a profound influence on neuronal connectivity. Recent
studies indicate that mammalian Notch receptors are expressed by postmitotic
neurons and that Notch signaling has a considerable influence on dendritic growth
and branching. Investigations into the intracellular effectors of dendritic
development have revealed that dendritic growth and branching are differentially 
affected by activation of the Rho-family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. These
observations suggest that the differential activation of Notch receptors and
Rho-family GTPases by extracellular signals may be important in the generation of
morphological diversity in the developing nervous system.

It is now well established that the small GTPases of the Rho family--Rac, Cdc42
and Rho--regulate growth cone morphology. Less clear is their role in guiding the
growth cone. Do they act permissively, providing the dynamic actin structures
needed for guidance? Or do they act instructively, transducing specific guidance 
signals? Recent studies have provided the first strong evidence for an
instructive role: extracellular guidance cues can modulate Rho GTPase activities 
in vitro, and Rho GTPase activators function in growth cone guidance in vivo. The
pathways linking Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton are also rapidly coming
into view, revealing further points of regulation by extracellular guidance cues.
The growth cone is therefore guided by signals transduced both via and
independently of Rho GTPases.

Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) continue to emerge as
important signalling molecules in axons and their growth cones. Recent findings
show that Drosophila RPTPs play key roles in guiding retinal axons and in
preventing midline crossing of longitudinal axons. Vertebrate RPTPs are now
implicated in controlling axon outgrowth, and preliminary evidence suggests that 
they too may influence axon guidance.

During the past year, a major advance in the study of axon regeneration was the
molecular cloning of Nogo. The expression of Nogo protein by CNS myelin may be a 
major factor in the failure of CNS axon regeneration. The effect of disrupting
Nogo-dependent axon inhibition can now be studied conclusively. In related work, 
immunization with a Nogo-containing CNS myelin preparation was shown to promote
regeneration and dramatic functional recovery after spinal cord trauma.

Recent studies have transformed our understanding of the embryonic rhombic lip by
revealing the inductive cues, regional origins and guidance molecules that
pattern the development of this important structure and its derivatives. In the
cerebellum, a precise combination of anteroposterior and dorsalising cues induces
a stream of migratory progenitors that give rise to the external granule cell
layer, while more caudally, Netrin orchestrates the migration of hindbrain
rhombic lip derivatives to form the precerebellar nuclei. The rhombic lip is thus
emerging as a spatiotemporally distinct epithelium whose late appearance in both 
development and evolution is instrumental in generating a complex, functionally
related but spatially distributed neural system.

The traditional views regarding the biological functions of the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family have been revisited recently with new
evidence that at least some of the members of this receptor family act as
signal-transduction molecules. Known for their role in endocytosis, particularly 
of their namesake the LDLs, and for their role in the prevention of
atherosclerosis, these receptors belong to an ancient family with numerous
ligands, effector molecules and functions. Recent evidence implicates this family
of receptors in diverse signaling pathways, long-term potentiation and neuronal
degeneration.

The existence of neural stem cells in the adult brain was essentially denied
until the last decade. Within the past ten years, considerable progress has been 
made in examining the fundamental properties of neural stem cells. Most recently 
there has been much interest in the identification and precise location of the
adult neural stem cells in vivo. Studies examining the localization of neural
stem cells are controversial and suggest two distinct locations within the adult 
brain: the ependymal layer lining the ventricles, and the subependymal layer
immediately adjacent to the ependyma.

When and how is the area map of the cerebral cortex set up during development?
Recent studies indicate that regional pattern emerges early in cortical
neurogenesis, and that this pattern does not require cues from extrinsic
innervation. Studies of mutant mice indicate a role for embryonic signaling
centers and for specific transcription factors in regionalizing the cortex. Thus,
it is increasingly probable that the cortex is partitioned using the same types
of mechanisms--and in some cases, the same gene families--that are used in
patterning other parts of the embryo. This emerging model is likely to be the
basis for many future studies. However, new evidence also confirms the special
nature of the cerebral cortex, in that cues from developing connections appear to
modify and refine the final area map.

Cell fate in the cephalic neural primordium is controlled by an organizer located
at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Studies in chick, mouse and zebrafish
converge to show that mutually repressive interactions between homeodomain
transcription factors of the Otx and Gbx class position this organizer in the
neural primordium. Once positioned, independent signaling pathways converge in
their activity to drive organizer function. Fibroblast growth factors secreted
from the organizer are necessary for, and sufficient to mimic, organizer activity
in patterning the midbrain and anterior hindbrain, and are tightly controlled by 
feedback inhibition.

The evolutionary conservation of Chordin/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling supports the hypothesis of dorsal-ventral axis inversion of vertebrates
and invertebrates, and implies that the invention of a central nervous system
occurred only once during animal evolution. This hypothesis is further
strengthened by recent findings of the conservation of downstream genes and
modifier genes of neural induction. On the other hand, in contrast with such
gross conservation, recent data suggest that the requirement for some signals in 
neural determination may differ even within the vertebrate subphylum.

New methods of intervention in Drosophila and other insect species reveal that
the mushroom bodies are involved in a diverse set of behavioral functions. The
intrinsic Kenyon cells (those neurons with projections within the mushroom
bodies) house part of the short-term memory trace for odors and are required for 
courtship conditioning memory. A pair of extrinsic mushroom body neurons (neurons
with projections both inside and outside the mushroom bodies) provides a
neuropeptide important for 1-hour olfactory memory. In addition, the mushroom
bodies are necessary for context generalization in visual learning and for
regulating the transition from walking to rest.

Neuron production, migration and differentiation are major developmental events
that continue, on a smaller scale, into adult life in a wide range of species
from insects to mammals. Recent reports of adult neurogenesis in primates,
including humans, have led to explosive scientific and public attention. During
the last two years, significant discoveries have revealed that the generation,
recruitment and survival of new neurons in adult brains are governed by
principles similar to those that shape the developing brain, such as neuronal
death, sensory experience, activity levels, and learning. Similarly, many factors

manipulations of the numbers of adult-generated neurons to address their
potential behavioral function.

During the past year, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of
the wide-ranging functions of the hippocampus. Highlights include the development
of new tasks with which to assess spatial/topographic memory in humans and
monkeys, novel tests of relational memory in rats, and episodic-like memory tasks
in birds. In addition, novel theories of hippocampal function have been developed
that are notable for their applicability to both humans and animal models.

Insects, like all hearing animals, must analyze acoustic signals to determine
both their content and their location. Neurophysiological experiments, together
with behavioral tests, are beginning to reveal the mechanisms underlying these
signal-analysis tasks. Work summarized here focusses on two issues: first, how
insects analyze the temporal structure of a single signal in the presence of
other competing signals; and second, how the signal's location is represented by 
the binaural difference in neural activity.

The most notable advance in our knowledge of path integration in insects is a new
understanding of how the honeybee measures the distance that it travels during
its foraging trips. Data from two groups show that the bee's odometer records
distance in terms of the net amount of image motion over the retina that is
accumulated during a flight. Progress has also been made in clarifying the
relation between path integration and other navigational strategies. On
unfamiliar ground, path integration is the only available means of navigation. In
familiar surroundings, however, guidance by landmarks may override guidance by
path integration. Path integration then becomes a back-up strategy that is used
primarily when landmarks fail.

Recent work on the coding of spatial information in the brain has significantly
advanced our knowledge of sensory to motor transformations on several fronts. The
encoding of information referenced to the retina (eye-centered) but modulated by 
eye position, called a gain field representation, has proved to be very common
throughout parietal and occipital cortex. The use of an eye-centered
representation as a working memory of spatial location is problematic if the eyes
move during the memory period. Details regarding the manner in which the brain
solves this problem are beginning to emerge. Finally, the discovery of
eye-centered representations of ongoing or intended arm movements has changed the
way we think about the order of operations in the sensory to motor coordinate
transformation.

The notion of internal models has become central to the study of visually guided 
reaching. Armed with this theoretical framework, researchers are gleaning
insights into long-standing problems in the field, such as the ability to respond
rapidly to changes in the location of a reach target and the fine control of the 
multi-joint dynamics of the arm. A key factor in these advances is our increased 
understanding of how the brain integrates feedforward control signals, sensory
feedback, and predictions based on internal models of the arm.

The classical notion that the basal ganglia and the cerebellum are dedicated to
motor control has been challenged by the accumulation of evidence revealing their
involvement in non-motor, cognitive functions. From a computational viewpoint, it
has been suggested that the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the cerebral
cortex are specialized for different types of learning: namely, supervised
learning, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning, respectively. This
idea of learning-oriented specialization is helpful in understanding the
complementary roles of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum in motor control and 
cognitive functions.

Recently, two quite different approaches exemplifying 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' 
philosophies have shed new light on basal ganglia function. In vitro work using
organotypic co-cultures has implicated the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the
external segment of the globus pallidus (GP(e)) as pacemakers for low-frequency
bursting that is reminiscent of the activity produced in Parkinsonian tremor. A
circuit essential for avian song learning has been identified as part of the
basal ganglia with surprisingly well conserved cellular details; investigation of
this system may help to address general issues of basal ganglia function.

Classical eyelid conditioning has been used to great advantage in demonstrating
that the cerebellum helps to improve movements through experience, and in
identifying the underlying mechanisms. Results from recent studies support the
hypotheses that learning occurs in both the cerebellar nucleus and cortex, and
that these sites make different contributions. Specifically, results indicate
that the cerebellar cortex is responsible for temporally specific learning. A
combination of experimental and computational studies has been important for
arriving at these conclusions, which seem to be applicable to the broad range of 
movements to which the cerebellum contributes.

Recent advances indicate not only that the spinal cord has great potential for
locomotor recovery after lesion but also that locomotor training can optimise
this recovery through some form of 'learning'. Improvement of residual function
can also be achieved through the use of various drugs and treatments such as
spinal grafts. In spinal-cord-injured humans, a number of recent studies have
allowed an objective quantification of the improvement of locomotion through
various forms of training and stimulation.

The major recent advances in understanding the role of spinal neurons in
generating movement include new information about the modulation of classic
reflex pathways during fictive locomotion and in response to pharmacological
probes. The possibility of understanding movements in terms of spinal
representations of a basic set of movement primitives has been extended by the
analysis of normal reflexes. Recordings of the activity of cervical interneurons 
in behaving monkeys has elucidated their contribution to generating voluntary
movement and revealed their involvement in movement preparation.

During the past few years, much attention has been given to the role of
short-term synaptic plasticity, in particular depression and facilitation, in
sculpting network activity. A recent study shows that synaptic depression in
rhythmic motor networks could switch the control of network frequency from
intrinsic neuronal properties to the synaptic dynamics. Short-term synaptic
plasticity is also involved in the stabilization and reconfiguration of motor
circuits and in the initiation, maintenance and modulation of motor programs.

The field of motor control has broadened considerably over the past decade.
Increasingly detailed information has accrued about the cellular and molecular
processes involved in motor pattern generation and motor learning while, at the
other extreme, the comparison of studies in humans and monkeys has begun to
bridge the gap between cognitive and motor functions. The most striking feature
of recent research has been the intense use of electrophysiological procedures in
behaving monkeys and non-invasive imaging procedures in humans to elucidate
details of sensory-motor transformations and the functional roles of different
brain regions in the learning, planning and execution of movements.

Our understanding of sensory systems has grown impressively in recent years as a 
result of intense efforts to characterize the mechanisms underlying perception. A
large body of evidence has accrued regarding the processes through which sensory 
information at the biochemical, electrophysiological, and systems levels
contributes to the conscious experience of a stimulus. Our efforts to understand 
the function of sensory systems have been aided by the development of new
techniques, including powerful methods of molecular biology, refined short- and
long-term approaches to recording from single and multiple neurons, and
non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that allow us to study activity within the
human brain while subjects perform a variety of cognitive tasks. In future
research, the last approach is likely to form a bridge between the large body of 
electrophysiological knowledge acquired in animal experiments and that currently 
being obtained in human imaging research.

Long-lasting forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity require transcription 
and yet occur in a synapse-specific manner, indicating that there are mechanisms 
to target the products of gene expression to some but not other synapses of a
given cell. Studies in a variety of systems have indicated that mRNA localization
and synaptically regulated local protein synthesis constitute one such mechanism.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RNA localization and regulated
translation in neurons are just beginning to be delineated, and appear to be
similar to those used in asymmetric non-neuronal cells.

A recent series of exciting observations, using novel high-resolution time-lapse 
imaging of living cells, has provoked a major shift in our understanding of the
dendritic spine, from a stable storage site of long-term memory to a dynamic
structure that undergoes rapid morphological variations. Through these recent
observations, the molecular mechanisms underlying spine plasticity are beginning 
to emerge. A common mechanism involving changes in intracellular Ca(2+)
concentration may control both the formation/elongation and the
pruning/retraction of spines. Spine motility may be instrumental in the formation
of synapses, may contribute to the anchoring/removing of glutamate receptors at
spine heads, and may control the efficacy of existing synapses.

Vigorous investigation has finally begun to shed light on the cargo problem of
the microtubule-dependent motors, kinesin and dynein superfamily proteins.
Biochemical observations have suggested that the potential cargoes of certain
populations of motor proteins seem to be in vesicle-form, each vesicle possessing
specific functional marker molecules. In addition to the close relationship
between microtubule-dependent motors and cargoes in vesicle-form, kinesin has
also been highlighted as an apparent driving force for another cargo in
non-vesicle-form, cytoplasmic protein. On the basis of new biophysical and
cell-biological evidence, the controversy over the movement of cytoplasmic
cargoes has entered a new phase.

Studies on the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles have provided two novel insights 
into the mechanism of vesicle formation from donor membranes, both of which
concern lipids. One is the essential role of endophilin, a cytosolic protein
converting lysophosphatidic acid by addition of the fatty acid arachidonate into 
phosphatidic acid. The other is the essential role of membrane cholesterol, which
specifically interacts with synaptophysin, the major transmembrane protein of
synaptic vesicles. These findings reveal novel modes of membrane lipid
modification and lipid-protein interaction in vesicle biogenesis.

Taste receptor cells use a variety of mechanisms to transduce chemical
information into cellular signals. Seven-transmembrane-helix receptors initiate
signaling cascades by coupling to G proteins, effector enzymes, second messengers
and ion channels. Apical ion channels pass ions, leading to depolarizing and/or
hyperpolarizing responses. New insights into the mechanisms of taste sensation
have been gained from molecular cloning of the transduction elements, biochemical
elucidation of the transduction pathways, and electrophysiological analysis of
the function of taste cell ion channels.

The vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mammals plays an essential role in the detection
of pheromones, chemical cues secreted by animals that elicit genetically
programmed sexual and aggressive behaviors among conspecifics. The recent
characterization of genes encoding molecular components of the VNO sensory
response suggests that VNO neurons express a unique set of molecules to recognize
and translate pheromone signals into neuronal electrical activity. Identification
of these genes, which include putative pheromone receptor genes, has offered a
new opportunity to uncover basic principles of pheromone sensory processing and
important aspects of vomeronasal development.

Major advances have been made during the past two years in understanding how
honeybees process olfactory input at the level of their first brain structure
dealing with odours, the antennal lobe (the insect analogue of the mammalian
olfactory bulb). It is now possible to map physiological responses to
morphologically identified olfactory glomeruli, allowing for the creation of a
functional atlas of the antennal lobe. Furthermore, the measurement of
odour-evoked activity patterns has now been combined with studies of appetitive
odour learning. The results show that both genetically determined components and 
learning-related plasticity shape olfactory processing in the antennal lobe.

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is equipped with a sophisticated
olfactory sensory system that permits it to recognize and discriminate hundreds
of discrete odorants. The perception of these odorants is essential for the
animal to identify relevant food sources and suitable sites for egg-laying.
Advances in the last year have begun to define the molecular basis of this
insect's discriminatory power. The identification of a large multi-gene family of
candidate Drosophila odorant receptors suggests that, as in other animals, a
multitude of distinct odorants is recognized by a diversity of ligand-binding
receptors. How olfactory signals are transduced and interpreted by the brain
remains an important question for future analysis. The availability of genetic
tools and a complete genome sequence makes Drosophila a particularly attractive
organism for studying the molecular basis of olfaction.

Work on elucidating the mechanisms of plasticity in somatosensory maps continues 
apace. Recent work has focused on both the nature of the thalamocortical
interactions that determine plasticity, and on the differences between plasticity
induced by nerve block or damage versus that induced by experience. Recordings
from awake behaving animals have thrown light on the thalamocortical circuit
mechanisms that underlie map plasticity; meanwhile, intracellular recordings from
cortical slices have thrown light on the precise synaptic mechanisms underlying
plasticity.

The idea that sensory information is represented by the temporal firing patterns 
of neurons or entire networks, rather than by firing rates measured over long
integration times, has recently gained increasing experimental support. A number 
of mechanisms that help to preserve temporal information in ascending sensory
systems have been identified, and the role of inhibition in these processes has
been characterized. Furthermore, it has become obvious that temporal processing
and the representation of sensory events by temporal spike patterns are highly
dependent upon the behavioral state of the animal or experimental subject.

Cryptochromes (CRYs) are blue-light-absorbing proteins involved in a variety of
biological phenomena. In animals, CRYs exhibit a certain versatility with regard 
to these organisms' circadian rhythms, as has been revealed by the effects of
mutations and molecular manipulations. The rhythm system of Drosophila uses one
gene's worth of CRY protein to transmit light into a circadian clock within the
brain, which controls the fly's sleep-wake cycles. In fact, the relevant
pacemaking neurons are themselves circadian photoreceptive structures. In
peripheral tissues and others located posterior to the brain, Drosophila CRY may 
be a photoreceptive molecule and also part of the pacemaker mechanism. Mice have 
two CRY-encoding genes. They are expressed in many tissues, including the retina 
and a clock structure within the brain. In the former location, mouse CRY may
play a circadian-photoreceptive role, along with that mediated by rhodopsins
found elsewhere in the retina. In the latter tissue, the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nucleus, mouse CRYs are closely connected to the multimolecule
murine clock mechanism.

Seeing is important for most species and it has been a key selective advantage
throughout evolution. Consequently, there is a remarkable diversity among types
of eyes. Animals have converged on eight optical solutions for collecting and
focusing light; in contrast, all eyes share the same molecular strategy for
absorbing photons. Recent studies have identified similarities in the genetic
information that is used in the development of eyes, leading to the hypothesis
that distinctly different eye types might have had a monophyletic origin. Across 
many species, there is a remarkable continuity of the developmental genes that
participate in the construction of similar--but not necessarily homologous--eyes.

Following vesicular release, the biogenic amine neurotransmitters dopamine,
norepinephrine and serotonin are actively cleared from extracellular spaces by
presynaptic transporters. These transporters interact with multiple psychoactive 
agents including cocaine, amphetamines and antidepressants. Recent findings
indicate that amine reuptake is likely to be a tightly regulated component of
synaptic plasticity rather than a constitutive determinant of transmitter
clearance. Protein kinase C activation and transporter phosphorylation have been 
linked to regulatory protein trafficking, and both phosphorylation and
trafficking may be influenced by transporter ligands. Recognition that
transmitters, antagonists and second messengers can modify the intrinsic
activity, surface expression or protein levels of amine transporters raises new
questions about the fundamental nature of drug actions in vivo. The theory that
dysregulation of transporters may contribute to disease states is supported by
the recent discovery that a coding mutation in the human norepinephrine
transporter contributes to orthostatic intolerance.

Many constituents of Wnt signaling pathways are expressed in the developing and
mature nervous systems. Recent work has shown that Wnt signaling controls initial
formation of the neural plate and many subsequent patterning decisions in the
embryonic nervous system, including formation of the neural crest. Wnt signaling 
continues to be important at later stages of development. Wnts have been shown to
regulate the anatomy of the neuronal cytoskeleton and the differentiation of
synapses in the cerebellum. Wnt signaling has been demonstrated to regulate
apoptosis and may participate in degenerative processes leading to cell death in 
the aging brain.

Brief periods of strong neuronal activity induce long-lasting changes in synaptic
function. This synaptic plasticity is thought to play important roles in learning
and memory. One example--long-term potentation in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus--has been studied extensively, and conflicting views regarding the
underlying mechanisms have emerged. Recent findings, regarding basic properties
of synaptic transmission, appear to reconcile these diverging views.

complex, synaptotagmin III, nSec1, domains of NSF and its adaptor SNAP, along

Synaptic vesicles are recycled with remarkable speed and precision in nerve
terminals. A major recycling pathway involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis at
endocytic zones located around sites of release. Different 'accessory' proteins
linked to this pathway have been shown to alter the shape and composition of
lipid membranes, to modify membrane-coat protein interactions, and to influence
actin polymerization. These include the GTPase dynamin, the lysophosphatidic acid
acyl transferase endophilin, and the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin.
Protein perturbation studies in living nerve terminals are now beginning to link 
the actions of these proteins with morphologically defined steps of endocytosis.

Neurotrophins use two types of receptors, the Trk tyrosine kinase receptors and
the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), to regulate the growth, development,
survival and repair of the nervous system. These receptors can either collaborate
with or inhibit each other's actions to mediate neurotrophin effects. The
development and survival of neurons is thus based upon the functional interplay
of the signals generated by Trk and p75NTR. In the past two years, the signaling 
pathways used by these receptors, including Akt and MAPK-induced signaling via
Trk, and JNK, p53, and NF-kappaB signaling via p75NTR, have been identified. In
addition, a number of novel p75NTR-interacting proteins have been identified that
transmit growth, survival, and apoptotic signals.

The positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity can destabilize the properties
of neuronal networks. Recent work has demonstrated that this destabilizing
influence is counteracted by a number of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that
stabilize neuronal activity. Such mechanisms include global changes in synaptic
strengths, changes in neuronal excitability, and the regulation of synapse
number. These recent studies suggest that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity
often target the same molecular substrates, and have opposing effects on synaptic
or neuronal properties. These advances significantly broaden our framework for
understanding the effects of activity on synaptic function and neuronal
excitability.

Neurotransmitters are released by Ca(2+)-triggered exocytotic fusion of synaptic 
vesicles. Before fusion, vesicles dock at a specialised presynaptic plasma
membrane region, the active zone, where they are primed to a fusion competent
state. The nature of this priming reaction has long been enigmatic. Recent
evidence demonstrates that priming is an essential and rate-limiting step in
secretion from neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Members of the Unc-13 protein
family, which are highly conserved during evolution and act as novel targets of
the diacylglycerol second-messenger pathway, have been identified to play an
essential role in this process.

Calcium signaling is crucial for several aspects of plasticity at glutamatergic
synapses, and studies over the past two to three years have identified key
functions for Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II and IV (CaM-KII and 
CaM-KIV). Sustained activation of CaM-KII localized at the postsynaptic density
results in phosphorylation of numerous synaptic substrates including ion
channels, other signaling molecules and scaffolding proteins, to modulate
synaptic transmission within minutes. More prolonged responses may be effected
through enhanced dendritic protein synthesis of CaM-KII and regulation of nuclear
gene transcription by CaM-KIV.

During the past decade, mutations in several ion-channel genes have been shown to
cause inherited neurological diseases. This is not surprising given the large
number of different ion channels and their prominent role in signal processing.
Biophysical studies of mutant ion channels in vitro allow detailed investigations
of the basic mechanism underlying these 'channelopathies'. A full understanding
of these diseases, however, requires knowing the roles these channels play in
their cellular and systemic context. Differences in this context often cause
different phenotypes in humans and mice. The situation is further complicated by 
the developmental effects and other secondary effects that might result from
ion-channel mutations. Recent studies have described the different thresholds to 
which ion-channel function must be decreased in order to cause disease.

Recent technical developments, including antigen-retrieval and electron
microscopic immunogold methods, are making it possible to determine some of the
basic principles governing the subcellular distribution of ionotropic glutamate
receptors. Distinct AMPA and NMDA receptor subtypes are selectively targeted to
functionally different synapses of a single cell, resulting in an input-selective
fine-tuning and regulation of the postsynaptic responses. The amount, density and
variability of AMPA receptors at a given glutamatergic synapse is governed by
both pre- and postsynaptic factors, resulting in functionally distinct
glutamatergic connections that display characteristic patterns of receptor
expression.

Major advances have been made in understanding mechanisms mediating
downregulation of G protein-coupled receptors. Recent studies emphasize the role 
of multiple proteolytic mechanisms in downregulation. A specific mechanism of
downregulation, mediated by endocytosis of receptors via clathrin-coated pits
followed by sorting to lysosomes, has been examined in detail. Specific protein
interactions that control the specificity of G-protein-coupled receptor
trafficking in this pathway are beginning to be elucidated.

Fifteen years after its introduction by Anthony Barker, transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) appears to be 'coming of age' in cognitive neuroscience and
promises to reshape the way we investigate brain-behavior relations. Among the
many methods now available for imaging the activity of the human brain, magnetic 
stimulation is the only technique that allows us to interfere actively with brain
function. As illustrated by several experiments over the past couple of years,
this property of TMS allows us to investigate the relationship between focal
cortical activity and behavior, to trace the timing at which activity in a
particular cortical region contributes to a given task, and to map the functional
connectivity between brain regions.

Recent advances on the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder include: the
utilization of functional brain imaging; the incorporation of cross-system
research including neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes), neurochemical (corticotropin-releasing
factor, norepinephrine, serotonin, endogenous opiates), and neuroimmunological
(humoral and cellular immunity) systems; the expansion beyond exclusive study of 
combat veterans to include posttraumatic stress disorder patients suffering from 
noncombat traumas; and the development of animal models of traumatic stress.

During active behavior, patterns of hippocampal and neocortical neuronal activity
reflect ongoing inputs and their contexts. Recent neurophysiological
investigations have shown that during 'off-line' periods, traces of these
experiences are spontaneously reactivated in both structures. Although the
functional importance of this phenomenon remains to be demonstrated, it does
provide clues about the nature and mechanisms of memory retrieval and
consolidation.

Classical conditioning, the simplest form of associative learning, is one of the 
most studied paradigms in behavioural psychology. Since the formal description of
classical conditioning by Pavlov, lesion studies in animals have identified a
number of anatomical structures involved in, and necessary for, classical
conditioning. In the 1980s, with the advent of functional brain imaging
techniques, particularly positron emission tomography (PET), it has been possible
to study the functional anatomy of classical conditioning in humans. The
development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)--in particular
single-trial or event-related fMRI--has now considerably advanced the potential
of neuroimaging for the study of this form of learning. Recent event-related fMRI
and PET studies are adding crucial data to the current discussion about the
putative role of the amygdala in classical fear conditioning in humans.

Neuropsychological findings on the human neglect syndrome after parietal damage
may relate to the physiological properties of single cells that have been studied
in monkey parietal cortex and in related brain areas. Human neglect may reflect
partial loss or dysfunction of similar cell populations, producing a pathological
gradient in the numbers of cells representing particular lateral positions in
space, for particular functions. This can explain the graded deficits seen in
patients. We relate the patient deficits to cellular properties for several
current issues: spatial frames-of-reference; multimodal integration; effective
treatments for neglect; motor components to parietal function; and residual
unconscious processing. A neural perspective may resolve traditional debates in
the neglect literature and outline directions for future research.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is traditionally elicited
by massively synchronous, high-frequency inputs, which rarely occur naturally.
Recent in vitro experiments have revealed that both LTP and long-term depression 
(LTD) can arise by appropriately pairing weak synaptic inputs with action
potentials in the postsynaptic cell. This discovery has generated new insights
into the conditions under which synaptic modification may occur in pyramidal
neurons in vivo. First, it has been shown that the temporal order of the synaptic
input and the postsynaptic spike within a narrow temporal window determines
whether LTP or LTD is elicited, according to a temporally asymmetric Hebbian
learning rule. Second, backpropagating action potentials are able to serve as a
global signal for synaptic plasticity in a neuron compared with local associative
interactions between synaptic inputs on dendrites. Third, a specific temporal
pattern of activity--postsynaptic bursting--accompanies synaptic potentiation in 
adults.

Traditional theories of working memory and executive function, when mapped in
straightforward ways into the neural domain, yield predictions that are only
partly supported by the recent neuroimaging studies. Neuroimaging studies suggest
that some constituent functions, such as maintaining information in active form
and manipulating it, are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions. Some
hypothesized executive processes, such as goal management, have effects in
several cortical regions, including posterior regions. Such results suggest a
more dynamic and distributed view of the cortical organization of working memory 
and executive functions.

Over the years, a large body of literature has shown that humans display losses
in memory with age, but that not all types of memory are affected equally.
Similarly, recent evidence from functional neuroimaging experiments has revealed 
that, depending on the task, older adults can display greater or lesser activity 
in task-relevant brain areas compared with younger adults. Recent behavioral and 
neurophysiological experiments are furthering our understanding of the effects of
aging on cognition. It appears that some brain changes seen with age may be
compensatory.

Traditionally, motor and cognitive functions were studied separately; however,
the investigation of processes at the interface between cognition and action has 
become more and more popular recently. Typical research goals include the
identification of the processes involved using experimental psychological
methods, and understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these processes using
neurophysiological and functional neuroimaging methods. Specifically, there has
been a special emphasis during the past few years on timing mechanisms, practice 
effects, and the application of rules in guiding action. New information
concerning the neural mechanisms involved is being acquired at a rapid pace,
albeit mostly within a descriptive framework. With respect to specific brain
areas, a key finding has been the clear involvement of the primary motor cortex
in complex tasks engaging diverse motor and cognitive dimensions.

Knowledge or experiences are voluntarily recalled from memory by reactivation of 
their neural representations in the association cortex. Mnemonic representations 
of visual objects, located in the ventral processing stream of visual perception,
provide the best indication of how neuronal codes are created, organized and
reactivated. Associative codes are created by neurons that have the ability to
link the representations of temporally associated stimuli. Recent experiments
suggest that not only bottom-up signals from the retina but also top-down signals
from the prefrontal cortex can trigger the retrieval of associative codes, which 
may serve as a neural basis for conscious recall.

The theoretical foundations of learning and memory were laid by Donald Hebb 50
years ago. Recent genetic experiments that enhanced coincidence-detection of the 
NMDA receptor (a molecular master-switch in implementing Hebb's rule) and that
led to better learning and memory in adult animals have substantially validated
Hebb's rule in memory formation in the brain.

Schizophrenia is often associated with cognitive deficits, particularly within
the domains of memory and language. Specific cognitive deficits have recently
been linked to psychotic phenomena, including verbal hallucinations and
disorganized speech. Impairments of working and semantic memory are primarily due
to dysfunction of the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus. Cognitive
skills in schizophrenia predict social functioning and may serve as outcome
measures in the development of effective treatment strategies.

In recent years, a number of computational neural networks have been proposed
aimed at describing memory functions associated with different subregions of the 
hippocampus, namely dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. Recent evidence suggests that
indeed specific subregions of the hippocampus may subserve different
computational functions, such as spatial and temporal pattern separation,
short-term or working memory, pattern association, and temporal pattern
completion.

background strain, maternal behavioral influences, and pleiotrophy.

The Abl tyrosine kinase plays an important role in axonogenesis. Recent reports

families, including LAR phosphatases, catenin/cadherin cell adhesion complexes,
Trio family GEFs, and Ena/VASP family actin regulatory proteins. These findings
suggest that Abl and its associated proteins may regulate cell adhesion and actin
polymerization, thereby regulating growth cone motility during axonogenesis.

The semaphorins are a family of intercellular signaling proteins that has grown
to include 19 identified members in higher vertebrates. Several of its members
act as axonal guidance molecules. One participates in signaling in the immune
system. The majority, however, do not yet have known biological functions. Recent
studies have shown that neuropilins and plexins act as receptors for semaphorins.
The most important challenge for the future is to define the biological roles of 
semaphorins in vivo.

Evidence for active triggering of neuronal death continues to accumulate. The
transmembrane receptors p75(NTR) and Fas can trigger (and in some cases are
required for) programmed cell death of the neurons that express them, through
signalling pathways that are regulated by a variety of cytoplasmic effectors.
Neuronal death induced by trophic deprivation often requires Fas signalling,
further blurring the boundaries between naturally occurring and stress-induced
neuronal death.

Recent progress in elucidating the biology of Notch and presenilin has revealed a
close functional relationship between these two proteins during cell fate
determination in worms, flies and humans. Presenilins are required for the
putatively intramembranous proteolysis of Notch to release its intracellular
domain to the nucleus. This finding establishes a specific biochemical role for
presenilins in Notch signaling and interfaces with emerging evidence about how
frizzled, disheveled and numerous other genes regulate the highly complex Notch
pathway. Advances in understanding Notch and presenilin functions in the
differentiation of neurons and non-neural cells have important implications not
only for development but also for late-life degenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer's disease.

the fly and vertebrate central nervous systems. The mode of action of many of
these factors has been conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates throughout

complexes, the utilization of repressors for maintaining specificity, and the use
of phosphorylation as an important means for transiently altering transcriptional

The creation of enduring modifications in synaptic efficacy requires new protein 
synthesis. Neurons face the formidable challenge of directing these newly made
proteins to the appropriate subset of synapses. One attractive solution to this
problem is the local translation of mRNAs that are targeted to dendrites and
perhaps to synapses themselves. The molecular mechanisms mediating such local
protein synthesis, notably CPEB-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation, are now
being elucidated.

regulating this columnar gene expression pattern appear to have diverged
significantly throughout evolution. In addition, while recent loss-of-function
studies in flies and mice indicate that these three genes may have a conserved
role in regional specification, there is no obvious conservation of the
particular cell fates deriving from corresponding domains. The three-column
expression pattern may thus represent a developmental mechanism that is more
resistant to evolutionary changes than genetic events upstream or downstream of
it.

The glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family has recently been
expanded to include four members, and the interactions between these neurotrophic
factors and their unique receptor system is now beginning to be understood.
Furthermore, analysis of mice lacking the genes for GDNF, neurturin, and their
related receptors has confirmed the importance of these factors in
neurodevelopment. The results of such analyses reveal numerous similarities and
potential overlaps in the way the GDNF and the nerve growth factor (NGF) families
regulate development of the peripheral nervous system.

Recent studies have made progress in characterizing the determinants of critical 
periods for experience-dependent plasticity. They highlight the role of
neurotrophins, NMDA receptors and GABAergic inhibition. In particular, genetic
manipulation of a single molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), has 
been shown to alter the timing of the critical period of plasticity in mouse
visual cortex, establishing a causal relation between neurotrophin action, the
development of visual function, and the duration of the critical period.

Our understanding of neuronal synapse development has advanced in recent years.
The development of glycinergic synapses appears to depend on gephyrin and glycine
receptor activity. Molecular characterization of the structure and development of
glutamatergic synapses is in progress, but the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. Activity-dependent mechanisms and specific molecules that regulate the
morphological development of dendritic spines have recently been identified.

Recent psychophysical studies on normal subjects, as well as brain imaging
studies, have revised the concepts concerning the mechanisms underlying spatial
orientation during navigation tasks. The emphasis has been put on internal models
that allow the prediction of a planned trajectory and are essential in the
steering of locomotion. Cognitive factors such as strategies and emotional
parameters are now starting to be included in the research on spatial
orientation. It is obvious that important individual and gender differences exist
in the brain operations underlying spatial orientation in humans, which may help 
to understand the construction of a coherent perception and the organic neural
disorders related to the internal representation of space.

Afferent modulation of dopamine neuron firing patterns.

Tennessee, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.

In recent studies examining the modulation of dopamine (DA) cell firing patterns,
particular emphasis has been placed on excitatory afferents from the prefrontal
cortex and the subthalamic nucleus. A number of inconsistencies in recently
published reports, however, do not support the contention that tonic activation
of NMDA receptors is the sole determinate of DA neuronal firing patterns. The
results of work on the basic mechanism of DA firing and the action of apamin
suggest that excitatory projections to DA neurons from cholinergic and
glutamatergic neurons in the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus, and/or
inhibitory GABAergic projections, are also involved in modulating DA neuron
firing behavior.

Motor imagery corresponds to a subliminal activation of the motor system, a
system that appears to be involved not only in producing movements, but also in
imagining actions, recognising tools and learning by observation, as well as in
understanding the behaviour of other people. Recent advances in the field include
the use of techniques for mapping brain activity and probing cortical
excitability, as well as observation of brain lesioned patients during imaging
tasks; these advances provide new insights into the covert aspects of motor
activity.

It has been possible to expand considerably our understanding of human motor
development by making a detailed analysis of various types of movement and
muscular activation patterns during different stages of development. Alterations 
in development subsequent to the appearance of brain lesions have enabled
valuable information to be collected about the underlying neural mechanisms, in
addition to new information concerning the pathophysiology of cerebral palsy.
Studies on the development of the corticospinal system indicate that plastic
changes can take place after perinatal brain damage.

A major challenge for current research in neuroscience is to understand the
intrinsic operation of the functional modules of the central nervous system, such
as those formed by cortical columns and the neuronal networks controlling motor
behaviour. Most vertebrate experimental models used in network analyses involve
developing nervous systems, which are in rapid transition with regard to their
cellular properties and the expression of different ion channels. Recent advances
in our understanding of the cellular and circuit properties of motor networks are
making it possible to decipher the mechanisms involved in vertebrate motor
pattern generation.

Recent advances in the neurobiology of sexual behavior have helped to refine our 
understanding of the neuroanatomical, neuroendocrine and neurochemical systems
that modulate responses to sexual stimulation. Both appetitive and consummatory
sexual behaviors have been studied in several laboratory species and in humans
using traditional and novel behavioral paradigms. New knowledge has emerged
concerning the role of hypothalamic, limbic and brainstem structures,
neuropeptides, brain monoamines and nitric oxide in the control of partner
preference, sexual desire, erection, copulation, ejaculation, orgasm and sexual
satiety. Brain imaging of visually evoked sexual arousal in humans has also been 
examined.

When different cone snail peptides are injected into the CNS of vertebrates, they
elicit diverse behaviors primarily because of their selectivity for specific
receptor or ion channel subtypes. The subcellular context of the highly localized
targets (i.e. the presence of other cellular elements that are functionally
linked to the targets of conopeptides) is another determinant of the elicited
behavior. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms by
which four conopeptides produce different behaviors in mice.

The development of motor behaviour depends on the differentiation of underlying
circuitry. Recent work with the zebrafish brings the simple swimming behaviour of
lower vertebrates and their embryos into focus as a suitable model to study the
development of motor circuitry and its genetic control. Changes in connectivity
and excitability contribute to the development of swimming in this simple system.
In the chick embryo, limb motor circuitry is spontaneously active before motor
axons reach their muscle targets, and it has properties in common with the
spontaneously active networks in the retina. The early rhythmic activity
responsible for embryonic movement is probably a generalised property of
developing spinal networks that precedes, and may be required for, the completion
of functional locomotor circuitry.

Sex and death. Two things that come once in a lifetime. Only after death you're

distinguish those aspects that are controlled genetically. Much of the recent
progress in studies of the molecular neurogenetics of sexual differentiation and 
behaviour has come from the use of genetically tractable organisms (i.e.
fruitflies and nematode worms) that exhibit a full range of sexually dimorphic
phenotypes.

A number of internal model concepts are now widespread in neuroscience and
cognitive science. These concepts are supported by behavioral,
neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their
structures and functions revealed by such data. In particular, a specific theory 
on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from 
cerebellar Purkinje cells. Multiple paired forward inverse models describing how 
diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have
recently been proposed. The 'minimum variance model' is another major recent
advance in the computational theory of motor control. This model integrates two
furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that
both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and 
control.

Until recently, the neural bases underlying recovery of function after damage to 
the cerebral cortex were largely unknown. Recent results from neuroanatomical and
neurophysiological studies in animal models have demonstrated that after cortical
damage, long-term and widespread structural and functional alterations take place
in the spared cortical tissue. These presumably adaptive changes may play an
important role in functional recovery.

Important recent advances have been made in understanding the role of aminergic
modulation during the maturation of Xenopus larvae swimming rhythms, including
effects on particular ion channel types of component neurons, and the role of
peptidergic modulation during development of adult central patterns generators in
the stomatogastric ganglion of crustaceans. By recording from octopaminergic
neuromodulatory neurons during ongoing motor behavior in the locust, new insights
into the role of this peripheral neuromodulatory mechanism have been gained. In
particular, it is now clear that the octopaminergic neuromodulatory system is
automatically activated in parallel to the motor systems, and that both
excitation and inhibition play important functional roles.

Brain imaging techniques have demonstrated functional specialisation of multiple 
areas within the motor system. They have also defined the patterns of
interactions between these regions during normal motor function and in motor
disorders. Functional imaging makes visible the changes in cortical activity that
take place over time during motor functions, from the activations a fraction of a
second before voluntary action to cortical neuronal plasticity several weeks
after injury. Recently, the functional abnormalities underlying various acquired 
and developmental motor disorders have been described, as well as the effects of 
therapeutic intervention.

In both vertebrates and invertebrates, odorant molecules reach the dendrites of
olfactory receptor cells through an aqueous medium, which reflects the
evolutionary origin of these systems in a marine environment. Important recent
advances, however, have demonstrated striking interphyletic differences between
the structure of vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory receptor proteins, as well
as the organization of the genes encoding them. While these disparities support
independent origins for odor-processing systems in craniates and protostomes (and
even between the nasal and vomeronasal systems of craniates), olfactory neuropils
share close neuroanatomical and physiological characters. Whereas there is a case
to be made for homology among members of the two great protostome clades (the
ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans), the position of the craniates remains
ambiguous.

In the adult brain, actin is concentrated in dendritic spines where it can

this postsynaptic actin is linked to neurotransmitter receptors, influencing
their function and, in turn, being influenced by them. Thus, the actin
cytoskeleton is emerging as a key mediator between signal transmission and
anatomical plasticity at excitatory synapses.

The Notch pathway mediates cell-cell interaction in many developmental processes.
Multiple proteins regulate the Notch pathway, among these are the products of the
fringe genes. The first fringe gene was identified in Drosophila, where it is
involved in the formation of the dorsal/ventral border of the wing disc. It has
now been found to be crucial for determining the dorsal/ventral border of the
Drosophila eye. In vertebrates, fringe genes play roles in the formation of the
apical ectodermal ridge, the dorsal/ventral border in the limb bud, and in the
development of somitic borders. The roles of fringe in the neural tube or the
eyes of vertebrate embryos are not clear, although it is unlikely that these
roles are evolutionarily related to those in the same tissues in Drosophila.
Genetic evidences suggest that Fringe protein functions by modulating the Notch
signaling pathway, perhaps through differential regulation of Notch activation by
different ligands; however, the mechanism underlying Fringe function remains to
be investigated.

which these similarities represent evolutionary conservation.

Neuronal aggregates of the disease-causing protein, often in the nucleus of
affected cells, are a pathological hallmark of the neurodegenerative diseases
known as polyglutamine disorders. It was suggested that these nuclear aggregates 
are the cause of these disorders. However, recent evidence suggests that the
aggregates, in fact, are not the pathogenic basis and, instead, may play a role
in sequestration of the pathogenic protein.

The nervous system is evolutionarily conservative compared to the peripheral
appendages that it controls. However, species-specific behaviors may have arisen 
from very small changes in neuronal circuits. In particular, changes in
neuromodulatory systems may allow multifunctional circuits to produce different
sets of behaviors in closely related species. Recently, it was demonstrated that 
even species differences in complex social behavior may be attributed to a change
in the promoter region of a single gene regulating a neuromodulatory action.

Studies of neurotrophins and Trk receptors in jawless fish have shed light on the
course of events underlying the formation of these gene families. They evolved
early in vertebrate history during major gene duplication events, before the
appearance of cartilaginous fish. The existence of multiple genes has permitted
the diversification of neurotrophin and Trk receptor expression, and thereby
enabling the acquisition of specific functions in selective neuronal populations.

Extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are emerging as important
regulators of neuronal function. Recent advances have increased our understanding
of ERK signalling at the molecular level. In particular, it has become evident
that multiple second messengers, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, protein 
kinase A, calcium, and diacylglycerol, can control ERK signalling via the small G
proteins Ras and Rap1. These findings may explain the role of ERKs in the
regulation of activity-dependent neuronal events, such as synaptic plasticity,
long-term potentiation and cell survival. Moreover, they allow us to begin to
develop a model to understand both the control of ERKs at the subcellular level
and the generation of ERK signal specificity.

Glial cells are pivotal players during the development and function of complex

genes that control differentiation and function of CNS glial cells and their
interactions with neurons can be studied in detail at the CNS midline, where it

Transgenic approaches have recently been used to investigate the functions of
neuronal intermediate filaments. Gene knockout studies have demonstrated that
neurofilaments are not required for axogenesis and that individual neurofilament 
proteins play distinct roles in filament assembly and in the radial growth of
axons. The involvement of neurofilaments in disease is supported by the discovery
of novel mutations in the neurofilament heavy gene from cases of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and by reports of neuronal death in mouse models expressing
neurofilament and alpha-internexin transgenes. However, mouse studies have shown 
that axonal neurofilaments are not required for pathogenesis caused by mutations 
in superoxide dismutase and that increasing perikaryal levels of neurofilament
proteins may even confer protection in this disease.

Fine structural, computerized three-dimensional (3D) mapping of cell connectivity
in the amphioxus nervous system and comparative molecular genetic studies of
amphioxus and tunicates have provided recent insights into the phylogenetic
origin of the vertebrate nervous system. The results suggest that several of the 
genetic mechanisms for establishing and patterning the vertebrate nervous system 
already operated in the ancestral chordate and that the nerve cord of the
proximate invertebrate ancestor of the vertebrates included a diencephalon,
midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. In contrast, the telencephalon, a
midbrain-hindbrain boundary region with organizer properties, and the definitive 
neural crest appear to be vertebrate innovations.

The homeotic and cephalic gap genes play central roles in the specification of
the anteroposterior animal body axis. Genetic studies carried out in Drosophila
and mouse now demonstrate that these genes are also involved in embryonic brain
development. The homeotic genes act in posterior brain patterning, and the
cephalic gap genes act in anterior brain patterning. Moreover, striking
cross-phylum gene replacement experiments show that invertebrate and vertebrate
members of the orthodenticle gene family can functionally replace each other.
These findings indicate that the genetic mechanisms involved in embryonic brain
development are conserved and suggest a common evolutionary origin of the insect 
and vertebrate brain.

Single-unit neurophysiology and human psychophysics have begun to reveal distinct
neural mechanisms for processing visual stimuli defined by differences in
contrast or texture (second-order motion) rather than by luminance (first-order
motion). This processing begins in early visual cortical areas, with subsequent
extrastriate specialization, and may provide a basis for form-cue invariant
analyses of image structure, such as figure-ground segregation and detection of
illusory contours.

An important recent advance in the understanding of vertebrate photoreceptor
light adaptation has come from the discovery that as many as eight distinct
molecular mechanisms may be involved, and the realization that one of the
principal mechanisms is not dependent on calcium. Quantitative analysis of these 
mechanisms is providing new insights into the nature of rod photoreceptor light
adaptation.

The mechanosensitive hair bundles of vertebrate hair cells exhibit a remarkable
variety of shapes. For a given location in a sensory epithelium, however, the
shape and polarity of a hair bundle are specified precisely. Recent findings, in 
particular with analogous experimental systems of actin polymerization, suggest a
model of hair-bundle morphogenesis whereby different Rho guanosine
triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate the initiation phase and the elongation phase 
of local actin-filament assembly at the hair cell's apical membrane.

To hear, insects use diverse external structures, which transform acoustic
signals to mechanical ones, coupled to astonishingly uniform mechanosensory
transducers, the chordotonal organs. New evidence showing that chordotonal organs
and vertebrate auditory hair cells are developmentally related and that
chordotonal organs and insect bristle organs are mechanistically related suggests
that all these ciliated mechanoreceptors may be derived from the same ancestral
molecular mechanotransduction complex. Identification of these elusive molecules 
will settle this issue.

Evidence is accumulating for the existence of mechanisms that create and detect
synchrony among action potentials on short time scales both within and between
neurons. Progress is most rapid in the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus,
and cortical slices, where signal flow is better understood or more manipulable. 
The debate over the functional relevance of spike timing in cortex has gained
substance from new computational models but remains unresolved.

The nature of the neural basis of amblyopia is a matter of some debate. Recent
neurophysiological data show correlates of amblyopia in the spatial properties of
neurons in primary visual cortex. These neuronal deficits are probably the
initial manifestation of the visual loss, but there are almost certainly
additional deficits at higher levels of the visual pathways.

placebo analgesia, which is hard to reconcile with current models of descending
pain modulation, presents an exciting challenge to the field.

The odorant-induced Ca(2+) increase inside the cilia of vertebrate olfactory
sensory neurons controls both excitation and adaptation. The increase in the
internal concentration of Ca(2+) in the cilia has recently been visualized
directly and has been attributed to Ca(2+) entry through cAMP-gated channels.
These recent results have made it possible to further characterize Ca(2+)'s
activities in olfactory neurons. Ca(2+) exerts its excitatory role by directly
activating Cl(-) channels. Given the unusually high concentration of ciliary
Cl(-), Ca(2+)'s activation of Cl(-) channels causes an efflux of Cl(-) from the
cilia, contributing high-gain and low-noise amplification to the olfactory neuron
depolarization. Moreover, in combination with calmodulin, Ca(2+) mediates odorant
adaptation by desensitizing cAMP-gated channels. The restoration of the Ca(2+)
concentration to basal levels occurs via a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which extrudes
Ca(2+) from the olfactory cilia.

Direction-selective cells in the fly visual system that have large receptive
fields play a decisive role in encoding the time-dependent optic flow the animal 
encounters during locomotion. Recent experiments on the computations performed by
these cells have highlighted the significance of dendritic integration and have
addressed the role of spikes versus graded membrane potential changes in encoding
optic flow information. It is becoming increasingly clear that the way optic flow
is encoded in real time is constrained both by the computational needs of the
animal in visually guided behaviour as well as by the specific properties of the 
underlying neuronal hardware.

Although the response properties and synaptic projections of muscle sensory
neurons have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about how these
sensory neurons develop their unique phenotypes during embryonic life. The
explosion of new information on neurotrophins, however, has revealed that
neurotrophin 3 (NT3) is critically involved in several aspects of this
development, including the initial differentiation, survival, and perhaps even
the terminal arborizations of muscle sensory neurons within the spinal cord. The 
ETS family of transcription factors, recently shown to be expressed in these
sensory neurons, may help specify their choice of synaptic targets in the central
nervous system.

The nervous system encodes information relating chemical stimuli to taste
perception, beginning with transduction mechanisms at the receptor and ending in 
the representation of stimulus attributes by the activity of neurons in the
brain. Recent studies have rekindled the long-standing debate about whether taste
information is coded by the pattern of activity across afferent neurons or by
specifically tuned 'labeled lines'. Taste neurons are broadly tuned to stimuli
representing different qualities and are also responsive to stimulus intensity
and often to touch and temperature. Their responsiveness is also modulated by a
number of physiological factors. In addition to representing stimulus quality and
intensity, activity in taste neurons must code information about the hedonic
value of gustatory stimuli. These considerations suggest that individual
gustatory neurons contribute to the coding of more than one stimulus parameter,
making the response of any one cell meaningful only in the context of the
activity of its neighbors.

measured with fMRI, has been found to correlate with psychophysical performance, 
with visual attention, and with subjective perceptual experience.

'Ocular tracking' refers to visually driven, slow eye movements that stabilize
moving images on the retina, thereby facilitating high acuity vision. Recent
behavioral studies have shown that the primate brain produces several kinds of
ocular tracking responses that operate precisely and consistently, with
ultra-short latencies. Electrophysiological studies indicate that these tracking 
responses are mediated by a pathway that includes the medial superior temporal
area of the cerebral cortex. Responses of neurons in this pathway are consistent 
with the short latencies and complex visual properties observed in behavioral
studies of the tracking response.

Recent studies indicate that morphological alterations of axon branches that are 
removed during normal development are similar to those that occur following
ablation of postsynaptic cells in adult animals. In both situations, axons
retract (rather than degenerate), the calibers of withdrawing axon branches are
markedly reduced, and spherical swellings near (or at) the axon terminations
appear. The similarity between naturally occurring and target-deprived axon
withdrawal suggests that both developing and adult axons withdraw from target
cells that no longer provide support.

Metabotropic L-glutamate receptors are involved in various forms of synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus. The use of a new antagonist (LY341495) that blocks
all known metabotropic L-glutamate receptors in the brain, together with
subtype-selective antagonists, has identified multiple roles both for cloned and 
novel metabotropic L-glutamate receptors in hippocampal long-term potentiation
and long-term depression.

The recent discovery that familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2,
and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are allelic disorders caused by different
mutations in CACNA1A, a calcium-channel-encoding gene, adds to a growing list of 
channelopathies causing paroxysmal neurologic disturbance and progressive
neurodegeneration. Calcium channelopathies in the central nervous system provide 
a model to study the important roles that calcium channels play in neuronal
function.

All of the known protein serine/threonine phosphatases are expressed in the
brain. These enzymes participate in a variety of signaling pathways that modulate
neuronal activity. The multifunctional activity of many serine/threonine
phosphatases is achieved through their association with targeting proteins.
Identification and analysis of targeting molecules has led to new insights into
the functions of protein phosphatases in neuronal signaling. The recent use of
transgenic mice has also increased our understanding of the physiological roles
of these enzymes in the brain.

The rate at which mutant genes producing an epileptic phenotype in mice have been
identified over the past few years has been astounding. Manipulating the genome
of mice has led to identification of a diversity of genes whose absence or
modification either causes epileptic seizures or, conversely, limits
epileptogenesis. In addition, positional cloning of genes in which spontaneously 
arising mutations cause epilepsy in mice has led to the identification of genes
encoding voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Finally, engineering a mutation 
that mimics a rare form of human epilepsy has led to a mouse line with a
phenotype similar to that of the human disease. Taken together, these discoveries
promise to shed light on the mechanisms underlying genetic control of neuronal
excitability, suggest candidate genes underlying genetic forms of human epilepsy,
and provide a valuable model with which to elucidate how the genotype produces
the phenotype of a rare form of human epilepsy.

Many diffusible axon guidance cues and their receptors have been identified
recently. These cues are often found to be bifunctional, acting as attractants or
repellents under different circumstances. Studies of cytoplasmic signaling
mechanisms have led to the notion that the response of a growth cone to a
particular guidance cue depends on the internal state of the neuron, which, in
turn, is under the influence of other coincident signals received by the neuron. 
Furthermore, many diffusible guidance cues appear to share common cytoplasmic
signaling pathways.

Dendritic spines are distinguished by their shapes, subcellular composition, and 
synaptic receptor subtypes. Recent studies show that actin-dependent movements
take place in spine heads, that spines emerge from stubby and shaft synapses
after dendritic filopodia disappear, and that spines can form without synaptic
activation, are maintained by optimal activation, and are lost with excessive
activation or during degeneration.

Calcium ions play crucial signaling roles in many forms of activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity. Recent presynaptic [Ca2+]i measurements and manipulation of 
presynaptic exogenous buffers reveal roles for residual [Ca2+]i following
conditioning stimulation in all phases of short-term synaptic enhancement.
Pharmacological manipulations implicate mitochondria in post-tetanic
potentiation. New evidence supports an influence of Ca2+ in replacing depleted
vesicles after synaptic depression. In addition, high-resolution measurements of 
[Ca2+]i in dendritic spines show how Ca2+ can encode the precise relative timing 
of presynaptic input and postsynaptic activity and generate long-term synaptic
modifications of opposite polarity.

Neurotransmitter secretion shares many features with constitutive membrane
trafficking. In both cases, vesicles are targeted to a specific acceptor membrane
and fuse via a series of protein-protein interactions. Recent work has added to
the list of protein complexes involved and is beginning to define the order in
which they act. The rapid fusion, precise regulation and plasticity
characteristic of synaptic exocytosis probably results from the addition of
specialized regulators.

Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels play a central role in generating action
potentials and rhythmic patterns, as well as in dendritic signal processing in
neurons. Recently, the first structure of a member of the K+ channel family was
solved. Although this channel is from bacteria and has a streamlined body plan
with no voltage gating, it establishes the architecture of the functional core of
the voltage-gated (K+) channels and their relatives. This architecture explains
the crucial features of ion permeation and blockade, and gives some strong hints 
about gating. The bacterial K+ channel structure is the central piece in a
puzzle; it remains to be seen how it will fit together with other domains of the 
Kv channels, with auxiliary subunits, and with other signal transduction
molecules.

The heated debate over the level of postsynaptic receptor occupancy by
transmitter has not been extinguished - indeed, new evidence is fanning the
flames. Recent experiments using two-photon microscopy suggest that the
concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft does not attain levels
previously suggested. In contrast, recordings from glial cells and studies of
extrasynaptic receptor activation indicate that significant quantities of
glutamate escape from the cleft following exocytosis. Determining the amount of
glutamate efflux from the synaptic cleft and the distance it diffuses is critical
to issues of synaptic specificity and the induction of synaptic plasticity.

Protein kinase C has recently been shown to modulate the slow recovery from
inactivation of Na+ channels in apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons. Moreover, dendritic, A-type K+ channels have been found to be modulated 
by protein kinases A and C and by mitogen-activated protein kinase. The
electrical signalling ability of these dendrites is thus highly regulated by a
number of neurotransmitters and second-messenger systems.

The circuitry mediating the integration of reward perception and adaptive
behavioral responses has been further refined. Recent developments indicate that 
the nucleus accumbens has a primary role in motivational circuitry, whereas
afferents to the nucleus accumbens, in part, subserve distinct functions.
Dopaminergic afferents serve to signal changes in rewarding stimuli, whereas
glutamatergic input from the amygdala serves to cue behavior to conditioned
reward, and afferents from the prefrontal cortex integrate information from
short-term memory into behavioral responses.

Recent studies indicate that synapse addition and/or loss is associated with
different types of learning. Other factors influencing synaptogenesis and synapse
loss include neurotrophins, hormones, and the induction of long-term
potentiation. An emerging view of synaptic plasticity suggests that local
neurotrophin action and synaptically associated protein synthesis may promote
synaptic remodelling and changes in receptor expression or activation.

Auditory information is relayed from the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate
complex to a core of three primary or primary-like areas of auditory cortex that 
are cochleotopically organized and highly responsive to pure tones. Auditory
information is then distributed from the core areas to a surrounding belt of
about seven areas that are less precisely cochleotopic and generally more
responsive to complex stimuli than tones. Recent studies indicate that the belt
areas relay to the rostral and caudal divisions of a parabelt region at a third
level of processing in the cortex lateral to the belt. The parabelt and belt
regions have additional inputs from dorsal and magnocellular divisions of the
medial geniculate complex and other parts of the thalamus. The belt and parabelt 
regions appear to be concerned with integrative and associative functions
involved in pattern perception and object recognition. The parabelt fields
connect with regions of temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex that mediate
additional auditory functions, including space perception and auditory memory.

In current conceptualizations of visual attention, selection takes place through 
integrated competition between recurrently connected visual processing networks. 
Selection, which facilitates the emergence of a 'winner' from among many
potential targets, can be associated with particular spatial locations or object 
properties, and it can be modulated by both stimulus-driven and goal-driven
factors. Recent neurobiological data support this account, revealing the
activation of striate and extrastriate brain regions during conditions of
competition. In addition, parietal and temporal cortices play a role in
selection, biasing the ultimate outcome of the competition.

Perseverative actions are often the result of inhibitory problems; however,
inhibitory problems do not always lead to perseverative actions. Some problems of
inhibition have been attributed to immaturity of, or severe damage to, the
prefrontal cortex. Research in this area has generally failed both to take into
account species differences in prefrontal function that lead to different
perseverative errors and to distinguish between perseverative errors that arise
from a failure to inhibit salient emotions or motivational drives and errors that
arise from an inability to engage in conceptual change. Recent studies on humans,
chimpanzees, rhesus macaques, Japanese macaques, cotton-top tamarins and
marmosets support this notion.

The early specification of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons during
vertebrate CNS development relies on signals produced by a small number of
organizing centers. Recent studies have characterized these early organizing
centers, the manner in which they may be established, the inductive signals they 
produce, and candidate signaling systems that control the later development of
the dopaminergic system.

A fundamental issue concerning development of the vertebrate retina is the
relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic cues to the determination of
cell fate. Recent findings suggest that retinal progenitors go through a series
of changes in intrinsic properties that control their competence to make
different cell types and that extrinsic cues influence the ratios of the cell
types that they produce. Recent studies of the role of the basic helix-loop-helix
genes in retinal development have indicated that they can regulate competence
and/or other aspects of cell fate determination.

Ephrins, ligands for the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are pivotal
players in many developmental phenomena in both the central and peripheral
nervous systems. Ephrins appear to act typically, but not exclusively, as
repellents throughout development to influence axon pathfinding and topographic
mapping, as well as restricting cell migration and intermingling. Recent findings
are beginning to characterize the function and signaling of ephrins, as well as
major roles for them in other tissues.

Two types of genes activated by neural inducers have been identified, those that 
lead to the activation of proneural genes and those that limit the activity of
these genes to specific domains in the neural plate. The analysis of these genes 
has begun to fill gaps in our understanding of events that lead from neural
induction to the generation of neurons within three longitudinal columns in the
Xenopus and zebrafish neural plate.

this precise spatial map probably involves a hierarchy of guidance events, as

Patterned neural activity modifies central synapses during development and the
physiological properties of skeletal muscle by selectively repressing or
stimulating transcription of distinct genes. The effects of neural activity are
mostly mediated by calcium. Of particular interest are the cellular mechanisms
that may be used to sense and convert changes in calcium into specific
alterations in gene expression. Recent studies have addressed the importance of
spatial heterogeneity or of temporal changes in calcium levels for the regulation
of gene expression.

Over the past year, evidence has accrued that adult CNS stem cells are a
widespread progenitor cell type. These cells may normally replace neurons and/or 
glia in the adult brain and spinal cord. Advances have been made in understanding
the signals that regulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation. A deeper
understanding of the structure of germinal zones has helped us move towards
identifying stem cells in vivo. Recent studies suggest that the fate of stem cell
progeny in vivo may be linked to the complexity of the animal's environment.

Experimental studies over the past year have shown that neural activity has a
range of effects on the development of neural pathways. Although activity appears
unimportant for establishing many aspects of the gross morphology and topology of
the brain, there are many cases where the presence of neural activity is
essential for the formation of a mature system of neural connections; in some
instances, the pattern of neural activity actually orchestrates the final
arrangement of neural connections.

Examples of signaling molecules that are devoted to neuronal development at the
exclusion of other functions are scarce. It may then come as no surprise to learn
that a family of molecules that promote neuronal survival, differentiation and
outgrowth also regulate synaptic transmission at both developing and mature
synapses. Indeed, many studies over the past five years have shown that
neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4/5
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have both rapid and long-latency
influences on synaptic strength. New research has highlighted the enormous range 
of neurotrophin actions at both developing and mature synapses, demonstrating
that transmission can be enhanced or reduced at excitatory and inhibitory
synapses by either pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms.

In many parts of the vertebrate central nervous system, inputs of distinct types 
confine their synapses to individual laminae. Such laminar specificity is a major
determinant of synaptic specificity. Recent studies of several laminated
structures have begun to identify some of the cells (such as guidepost neurons in
hippocampus), molecules (such as N-cadherin in optic tectum, semaphorin/collapsin
in spinal cord, and ephrins in cerebral cortex), and mechanisms (such as
activity-dependent refinement in lateral geniculate) that combine to generate
laminar specificity.

Spontaneous neuronal activity has been detected in many parts of the developing
vertebrate nervous system. Recent studies suggest that this activity depends on
properties that are probably shared by all developing networks. Of particular
importance is the high excitability of recurrently connected, developing networks
and the presence of activity-induced transient depression of network
excitability. In the spinal cord, it has been proposed that the interaction of
these properties gives rise to spontaneous, periodic activity.

Recent studies have elucidated both the mechanism of early formation of diverse
muscle fibre types and the matching of diverse populations of motoneurons to
their appropriate muscle targets. Highlights include the demonstration that
distinct signals are necessary for the formation of several distinct myoblast
populations in the vertebrate somite, the identification of motoneuron subtypes, 
studies of how motoneurons target appropriate muscles, and rapid progress on the 
Drosophila neuromuscular system. We propose a model in which four classes of
decision control the patterning of both motoneurons and muscles.

Experience influences the development of certain behaviors and their associated
neural circuits during a discrete period after birth. Songbirds, with their
highly quantifiable vocal output and well-delineated vocal control circuitry,
provide an excellent context in which to examine the neural mechanisms regulating
sensitive periods for learning. Recent discoveries indicate that auditory input
to the vocal control circuitry in songbirds is dynamically modulated and show
that neural circuitry previously thought to be used only in plastic juvenile song
may also actively maintain stable adult song. These findings provide important
clues to how sensitive periods for auditory feedback and vocal plasticity are
regulated during song development.

The specification of neurotransmitter phenotype is an important aspect of
neuronal fate determination. Recent studies have begun to define essential
transcriptional regulators involved in controlling the mode of neurotransmission 
in vertebrates and invertebrates, and to examine their regulation by
cell-extrinsic factors. An emerging concept is that the control of transmitter
choice is intimately linked to that of other aspects of the neuronal phenotype.

Motoneurons have distinct identities and muscle targets. Recent classical and
molecular genetic studies in flies and vertebrates have begun to elucidate how
motoneuron identities and target specificities are established. Many of the same 
molecules participate in the guidance of both vertebrate and fly motor axons. It 
is less clear, however, whether the same molecular mechanisms establish
vertebrate and fly motoneuron identities.

Important advances have been made in our understanding of conditions that
influence the intrinsic capacity of mature CNS neurons to initiate and maintain a
regrowth response. The combination of exogenous neurotrophic support with
strategies to alter the terrain at the injury site itself suggests that there are
important interactions between them that lead to increased axonal regeneration.
The ability of chronically injured neurons to initiate a regeneration response is
unexpected. Our view of the role that inhibitors play in restricting axonal
growth has also expanded. The findings indicate that the windows of opportunity
for enhancing growth after spinal cord injury may be more numerous than
previously thought.

The membrane properties and the synaptic interactions of individual neurons, as
well as the interactions between neuronal networks, all contribute to the
formation of the complex patterns of activity that underlie rhythmic motor
patterns and slow-wave sleep rhythms. These properties and interactions are
potential points of modulation for further refining network output. Recent work
illustrates the range of these properties and interactions and suggests how they 
may be modulated.

motoneurons also contribute to the final masticatory motor output.

Accepting, rejecting or modifying the many different theories of the cerebellum's
role in the control of movement requires an understanding of the signals encoded 
in the discharge of cerebellar neurons and how those signals are transformed by
the cerebellar circuitry. Particularly challenging is understanding the sensory
and motor signals carried by the two types of action potentials generated by
cerebellar Purkinje cells, the simple spikes and complex spikes. Advances have
been made in understanding this signal processing in the context of voluntary arm
movements. Recent evidence suggests that mossy fiber afferents to the cerebellar 
cortex are a source of kinematic signals, providing information about movement
direction and speed. In turn, the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells
integrates this mossy fiber information to generate a movement velocity signal.
Complex spikes may signal errors in movement velocity. It is proposed that the
cerebellum uses the signals carried by the simple and complex spike discharges to
control movement velocity for both step and tracking arm movements.

Recent studies of visually guided reaching in monkeys support the hypothesis that
the visuomotor transformations underlying arm movements to spatial targets
involve a parallel mechanism that simultaneously engages functionally related
frontal and parietal areas linked by reciprocal cortico-cortical connections. The
neurons in these areas possess similar combinations of response properties. The
multimodal combinatorial properties of these neurons and the gradient
architecture of the parietofrontal network emerge as a potential substrate to
link the different sensory and motor signals that arise during reaching behavior 
into common hybrid reference frames. This convergent combinatorial process is
evident at early stages of visual information processing in the occipito-parietal
cortex, suggesting the existence of re-entrant motor influences on cortical areas
once believed to have only visual functions.

In contrast to the wealth of knowledge about the organizational rules of adult
central pattern generators, far less is known about how these networks are
assembled during development. The basic architecture for adult central pattern
generators appears early in development but different generators may follow
completely different developmental pathways to reach maturity. Recent evidence
suggests that neuromodulatory inputs, in addition to their short-term adaptive
control of central pattern generator activity, play a crucial role in both the
final developmental tuning and the long-term maintenance of adult network
function.

A combination of system-level and cellular-molecular approaches is moving studies
of oculomotor learning rapidly toward the goal of linking synaptic plasticity at 
specific sites in oculomotor circuits with changes in the signal-processing
functions of those circuits, and, ultimately, with changes in eye movement
behavior. Recent studies of saccadic adaptation illustrate how careful behavioral
analysis can provide constraints on the neural loci of plasticity. Studies of
vestibulo-ocular adaptation are beginning to examine the molecular pathways
contributing to this form of cerebellum-dependent learning.

Recent experiments have extended our understanding of how sensory information in 
premotor networks controlling motor output is processed during locomotion, and at
what level the efficacy of specific sensory-motor pathways is determined. Phasic 
presynaptic inhibition of sensory transmission combined with postsynaptic
alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission from interneurons 
of the premotor networks contribute to the modulation of reflex pathways and to
the generation of reflex reversal. These mechanisms play an important role in
adapting the operation of central networks to external demands and thus help
optimize sensory-motor integration.

How does the CNS coordinate muscle contractions between different body segments
during normal locomotion? Work on several preparations has shown that this
coordination relies on excitability gradients and on differences between
ascending and descending intersegmental coupling. Abstract models involving
chains of coupled oscillators have defined properties of coordinating circuits
that would permit them to establish a constant intersegmental phase in the face
of changing periods. Analyses that combine computational and experimental
strategies have led to new insights into the cellular organization of
intersegmental coordinating circuits and the neural control of swimming in
lamprey, tadpole, crayfish and leech.

Over the past year, the first components of the mammalian clock have been
identified; Clock, bmal1 and three homologs of Drosophila period have been
cloned, all of which encode PAS proteins. Expression of the mammalian period gene
oscillates in many tissues in vivo and in immortalized cell cultures in vitro.
Now, can we say that every cell has a circadian clock?

In the fruit-fly Drosophila, rhythmic expression of the clock gene period is
detected in cells throughout the body. Whereas these cells could be pacemakers
for circadian rhythms of unknown physiological processes, the brain pacemakers
are known to be responsible for circadian behavior. Recent progress in genetic
and molecular studies of clock genes in Drosophila has permitted the
identification of brain pacemakers at the cellular level and their output
pathways to rhythmic behavior. Similar studies in other insect species have
suggested considerable diversity in the anatomical and neurochemical properties
of pacemaker cells, as well as in the mechanisms of clock-gene regulation.

Developmental clocks are hypothetical embryonic time-measuring devices--some are 
run by oscillators, whereas others depend on rate-limiting processes. Their
existence has been deduced from recent studies of the timing of the midblastula
transition, the opening of the Hox cluster during organogenesis, and
oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation; however, the mechanisms underlying
their function remain largely unknown.

Recent findings have clarified the mechanisms regulating the night- and
pineal-specific transcription of serotonin N-acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting
enzyme in melatonin formation. Norepinephrine, acting via beta-adrenoceptors and 
cAMP at night, stimulates the cAMP response element binding protein, which turns 
on the transcription of N-acetyltransferase and inducible cAMP early repressor,
the major inhibitor of N-acetyltransferase transcription. The tissue-specific
gene expression within the pineal gland and retina derives, in part, from a
pineal/retina-specific transcription factor, cone-rod homeobox protein, which
binds to a pineal regulatory element. This regulatory element is present in
promoters of pineal-selective enzymes, such as N-acetyltransferase,
hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase, and pineal night-specific ATPase.

Nearly all studies of natural variation within clock genes involve the period
(per) locus, which was originally isolated in the fruit-fly. Intra- and
interspecific work on per has focused mostly on a region of Thr-Gly or Ser-Gly
repeats, which show rapid length and sequence evolution. The functional
implications of nucleotide variation in this repetitive array have been
characterised using behavioural, molecular, ecological, structural and
statistical analyses. A population genetics approach to variation in per has also
been useful in defining species histories within Drosophilids and, in some cases,
in implicating selective processes in the evolution of the per gene.
Interspecific analysis of per expression patterns reveals evolutionary
alterations in this clock gene's regulation.

The circadian clock keeps time through an intracellular oscillator that requires 
rhythmic gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, the core of this oscillator
is composed of a circadian feedback loop in which the transcription of the period
and timeless genes is repressed by their own protein products. In the past year, 
our understanding of clock organization and function in Drosophila has been
advanced by breakthroughs that define when, where and how this feedback loop
operates. These studies, along with those in other organisms, suggest that
circadian feedback loops are widespread and that genes within these feedback
loops are conserved between Drosophila and mammals.

While criteria for self-renewal and multipotentiality can be met with varying
degrees of confidence on the basis of recent in vitro and in vivo experiments, a 
consensus definition of stem cells remains illusive. It has been demonstrated
that adult CNS cells can divide and be induced to differentiate both in vivo and 
in vitro. These observations have important basic and applied implications;
however, the true identifies of these cells and factors, as well as the
mechanisms that control their fate, are unknown.

Chemorepulsive signals that repel or paralyze neuronal growth cones have been
found to play important roles in axon guidance in a stereotyped manner. Recent
progress in the identification of neuropilins as the receptors for class III
secreted collapsin/semaphorin subfamily members, which are neuronal repellents,
and in the analysis of mutant mice lacking neuropilin function has confirmed the 
importance of these chemorepellents in axon guidance. In addition,
characterization of the neuropilin protein has yielded new insights into the
functions of this molecule in vascular formation and in axon guidance.

The dendritic localization of mRNAs has been proposed to underlie the structural

plasticity. Even though there is no conclusive evidence that such a localization 
is a physiological requirement, studies of mRNA localization in relation to
function in other cell types and recent experiments on synaptic plasticity
suggest that this proposal may be correct.

The complex functions of the nervous system reflect the coordinated action of
intricately connected networks of neurons. Recent work has combined to suggest
the importance of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules in specifying
these connections at neural synapses. High-resolution structural studies and
site-directed mutagenesis have revealed some of the molecular mechanisms by which
cadherins function in cell-to-cell adhesion, and suggest new avenues for
investigation.

Several recent findings have advanced our understanding of the composition and

identified CNS-specific proteoglycan, is a component of the brain ECM and is
upregulated during glial cell motility. It is expressed at high levels during
development, in response to injury, and in primary brain tumors. Cleavage of the 
BEHAB/brevican protein may increase invasion of tumor cells.

Filamentous nerve cell inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases.

Author information:

Recent work has shown that abnormal filamentous inclusions within some nerve
cells is a characteristic shared by Alzheimer's disease, some frontotemporal
dementias, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system
atrophy, as well as Huntington's disease and other trinucleotide repeat
disorders. This suggests that in each of these disorders, the affected nerve
cells degenerate as a result of these abnormal inclusions. Except for
trinucleotide repeat disorders, the filaments involved have been shown to consist
of either the microtubule-associated protein tau or alpha-synuclein. Over the
past year, mutations in the genes for tau and alpha-synuclein have been
identified as the genetic causes of some familial forms of frontotemporal
dementia and Parkinson's disease, respectively. The discovery last year of
neuronal intranuclear inclusions in Huntington's disease and other disorders with
expanded glutamine repeats has suggested a unifying mechanism underlying the
pathogenesis of this class of neurodegenerative diseases.

Sensory systems.

Hudspeth AJ, Tanaka K.

Research on the senses spans the enormous range from analysis of individual
molecules involved in sensory transduction to the attempted elucidation of
conscious sensation. Because the variety of conceptual and experimental
approaches varies so broadly across the field, it is impossible to delineate a
single direction for future research. Two trends are nonetheless apparent. At the
reductionistic end of the spectrum, in the analysis of sensory transduction,
studies on all the senses will increasingly be driven by the techniques of
molecular biology. The advent of techniques for producing cDNA libraries from
small ensembles of receptor cells, or even from individual cells, will permit the
recognition of new constituents of receptor cells and of factors involved in
their specification, differentiation, and maintenance. In the integrative realm
of sensory neurobiology, future studies will increasingly rely on optical
techniques for the study of activity patterns on the surfaces of sensory areas of
the cerebral cortex and on noninvasive functional imaging for the investigation
of neural responses in human subjects. These techniques will continue to
strengthen our understanding of the relation between neuronal activity and
conscious sensory experience.

Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.

Damaged hair cells in the avian basilar papilla are replaced by regenerative
proliferation of supporting cells and transdifferentiation of supporting cells
into hair cells. In the mammalian vestibular system, transdifferentiation and,
possibly, the repair of damaged hair cells appear to play significant roles.
Several growth factors have been found to be associated with the
regeneration/repair process: insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and
fibroblast growth factors are important for avian inner ear regeneration/repair, 
whereas epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, insulin,
IGF-1, and IGF-2 are important for regeneration/repair in the mammalian
labyrinth. Increasing evidence suggests that regeneration/repair of mammalian
auditory hair cells is possible during the early neonatal period and may exist to
a very limited degree at later times.

Many fish species employ hormonal products as sex pheromones, and these cues are 
often mixtures that are released with a temporal pattern. This behavior is
strikingly similar to that of insects, as moths use precise blends of odorants as
sex pheromones and are skillful at tracking them in spite of changes in odor
intensity associated with aerial dispersal. New studies in both groups of animals
suggest many parallels in the functional anatomy of olfactory pathways and the
organization of information-coding circuits.

Within the hierarchy of motion perception, the dorsolateral middle superior
temporal area (MSTd) is optimally suited for the analysis of the complex motion
patterns that are directly useful for visually guided behaviour (e.g. computation
of heading). Recent electrophysiological and psychophysical evidence suggests the
existence of 'detectors' in MSTd that are specialised for complex motion patterns
and advocates the necessity of combining retinal and extraretinal signals
received by MSTd neurones for the accurate perception of heading. In some
neurological patients, of which only a small number have been reported to date,
lesions involving the human homologue of MST have devastating effects on their
ability to navigate in their surroundings. It has been reported that these
patients have impaired performance of psychophysical tasks of complex motion
discrimination.

Conscious experience involves perceiving, attending, remembering, and
recognizing. Recent neuroscientific research has made significant contributions
to our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate such capacities.
Physiological and neuropsychological investigations have provided increasingly
detailed descriptions of the location and functional properties of the brain
structures involved in conscious perception, in attentive behavior and working
memory, and in the recognition of objects. Such studies suggest that awareness of
a visual stimulus probably reflects the interconnectivity and the type of cells
involved in the representation of this stimulus, rather than the activity of
specific circumscribed visual areas or processing streams.

Comparative studies of vertebrate hearing organs have enabled an integrated
approach to difficult questions related to function. Recent evidence for the
independent evolution of similar hearing-organ specializations, in particular
hair-cell differentiation, has helped identify common problems of hearing
receptors and put them in a new perspective. Evidence that cochlear amplification
is an ancient phenomenon has widened the search for the motor mechanism involved.
In this regard, different hypotheses are best examined by making optimal use of
natural structural variations. Studies on the evolution of the efferent system
have provided new routes to investigate its function.

this interpretation, the proteins necessary for the release and transport of
lipophilic fatty acids are found in the oral cavity, and taste cells have
recently been shown to contain fatty-acid-sensitive ion channels and transport

The cortical visual system consists of many richly interconnected areas. Each
area is characterized by more or less specific receptive field tuning properties.
However, these tuning properties reflect only a subset of the interactions that
occur within and between areas. Neuronal responses may be modulated by perceptual
context or attention. These modulations reflect lateral interactions within areas
and feedback from higher to lower areas. Recent work is beginning to unravel how 
horizontal and feedback connections each contribute to modulatory effects and
what the role of these modulations is in vision. Whereas receptive field tuning
properties reflect feedforward processing, modulations evoked by horizontal and
feedback connections may reflect the integration of information that underlies
perception.

The neocortex has a distinctive laminar and modular organization. Although
important questions remain regarding structure and function at this level of
organization, recent studies are addressing a finer scale of synaptic and network
microstructure. New findings concerning network properties are rapidly emerging
from approaches in which dual or triple intracellular recordings in vitro are
combined with analyses of cell and synaptic morphology, as well as from
experiments designed to label multiple cell populations.

Work on the functional organization of auditory cortex in nonhuman primates has
recently gained increasing attention. Neurophysiological studies using complex
stimuli, combined with anatomical tract tracing, reveal a hierarchy of cortical
processing comparable to other sensory systems. On the basis of these findings
from animal studies, together with the advent of modern neuroimaging methods used
in human cortex, the field of auditory neuroscience could soon arrive at a
detailed understanding of the cortical representation of complex sounds,
including speech.

In monkey cerebral cortex, color information is processed along the ventral
visual pathway. This pathway starts in the primary visual cortex and ends in area
TE of the inferior temporal cortex. Recent studies indicate that the
transformation of cone signals occurs early in the pathway to form neurons
selective to a narrow range of hues. In addition, it has become apparent that
area TE plays a vital role in color discrimination.

Voltage-gated calcium channels are found in all excitable cells, in which they
regulate many important physiological functions, including excitability, gene
transcription, muscle contraction, and neurotransmitter and hormone release. The 
differential modulation of calcium channels by intracellular second messengers
constitutes a key mechanism for controlling calcium influx. Recent advances have 
provided important clues to the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the
inhibition of N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels by a membrane-delimited
G-protein-dependent pathway.

Calcium influx through the TRP and TRPL light-activated channels triggers a
complex regulatory hierarchy resulting in positive and negative feedback
regulation of the phototransduction cascade. Recent studies have begun to
elucidate the function of TRP and TRPL in vivo, and to examine their relationship

Subcellular targeting of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is achieved, in part, 
through association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Recent evidence
suggests that specific AKAPs direct the kinase to submembrane sites to facilitate
phosphorylation and modulation of a variety of ion channels. A new
membrane-anchored AKAP targets cAMP-dependent protein kinase to calcium channels 
and enhances their regulation in multiple cell types.

The mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation and repression have become
much clearer. Recent evidence suggests that transcription factors that do not
bind DNA directly, the co-activators and co-repressors, mediate a large number of
cell signaling events. Their association with histone acetylases, to mediate
activation, or deacetylases, to mediate repression, provide a model for
explaining how gene expression is regulated.

The targeting of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors to synapses in the
central nervous system is essential for efficient excitatory synaptic
transmission. Recent studies have indicated that protein-protein interactions of 
these receptors with synaptic proteins that contain PDZ domains are crucial for
receptor targeting. NMDA receptors have been found to bind to the PSD-95 family
of proteins, whereas AMPA receptors interact with the PDZ-domain-containing
protein GRIP (glutamate receptor interacting protein). PSD-95 and GRIP contain
multiple PDZ domains as well as other protein-protein interaction motifs that
help to form large macromolecular complexes that may be important for the
formation and plasticity of synapses.

In the Drosophila eye, photoactivation of rhodopsin leads to the opening of the
light-sensitive cation influx channels TRP and TRPL. This response is extremely
rapid and results in depolarization of the photoreceptor cells followed by
Ca(2+)-mediated feedback regulation of the visual signaling cascade. The
mechanisms that facilitate the rapid kinetics of activation and feedback
regulation are poorly understood. However, the recent discovery that most of the 
proteins that function in fly phototransduction associate into a supramolecular
complex permits a re-evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the activation and
regulation of the cascade. The central player in the signaling complex is INAD, a
protein with five protein-interaction motifs known as PDZ domains. The INAD
complex does not appear to be a particle, but a massive signaling web composed of
an INAD polymer with which some of the target proteins associate through complex 
multivalent interactions.

Novel members of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel/ degenerin family of ion
channels were discovered recently. With the cloning of four mammalian H(+)-gated 
cation channel subunits, the first members of a novel class of ligand-gated

in the central and peripheral nervous system. In sensory neurones, they are
thought to be involved in the perception of pain that accompanies tissue
acidosis.

Calcium-activated potassium channels.

Calcium-activated potassium channels are fundamental regulators of neuronal
excitability, participating in interspike interval and spike-frequency
adaptation. For large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels,
recent experiments have illuminated the fundamental biophysical mechanisms of
gating, demonstrating that BK channels are voltage gated and calcium modulated.
Structurally, BK channels have been shown to possess an extracellular
amino-terminal domain, different from other potassium channels. Domains and
residues involved in calcium-gating, and perhaps calcium binding itself, have
been identified. For small- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated
potassium channels, SK and IK channels, clones have only recently become
available, and they show that SK channels are a distinct subfamily of potassium
channels. The biophysical properties of SK channels demonstrate that kinetic
differences between apamin-sensitive and apamin-insensitive slow
afterhyperpolarizations are not attributable to intrinsic gating differences
between the two subtypes. Interestingly, SK and IK channels may prove effective
drug targets for diseases such as myotonic muscular dystrophy and sickle cell
anemia.

Specific transport activities package classical neurotransmitters into secretory 
vesicles for release by regulated exocytosis, but the proteins responsible for
the vesicular transport of neurotransmitters are still being identified. One
family of proteins includes vesicular transporters for monoamines and
acetylcholine. Genetic manipulation in cells and in mice now shows that changes
in the expression of these proteins can alter the amount of neurotransmitter
stored per synaptic vesicle, the amount released and behavior. Although the
mechanisms responsible for regulating these transporters in vivo remains unknown,
recent work has demonstrated the potential for regulation by changes in intrinsic
activity and in location. In addition, a recently identified vesicular
transporter for GABA defines a novel family of proteins that mediates the
packaging of amino acid neurotransmitters.

Neuronal and cardiac voltage-gated ion channels contain auxiliary subunits that
can profoundly affect the gating of the pore-forming and voltage-sensing alpha
subunits. Recent studies on the structurally similar cytoplasmic beta subunits of
Ca2+ and K+ channels reveal that these subunits can also exert profound effects
on the expression of the integral membrane protein channel components. The
mechanisms by which these effects occur are now being elucidated through a
combined approach that employs biophysical, pharmacological, cell biological and 
biochemical techniques.

High densities of acetylcholine receptors and sodium channels in the crests and
troughs of the postsynaptic folds, respectively, ensure reliable neuromuscular
signalling. Clustering of both ion channels is mediated by agrin. In the case of 
acetylcholine receptors, agrin activates the tyrosine kinase receptor
muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), initiating a process requiring rapsyn and possibly
also receptor phosphorylation. In many respects, the interactions between agrin
and MuSK and their downstream effectors are atypical of conventional receptor
tyrosine kinase signalling systems. A new understanding of the structural
features of rapsyn involved in receptor clustering, as well as syntrophin's role 
in sodium channel targeting, has recently been revealed. Perhaps the most
surprising result of the past year with regard to synaptogenesis is a negative
one--mice lacking both dystrophin and utrophin have nearly normal neuromuscular
junctions.

putative cognitive deficits observed using such a paradigm may be biased by the

genes, inducible and reversible gene targeting in selected brain regions, and
single-cell recordings of hippocampal place cells in mutant mice.

Currently, diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) are made on the basis of phenomenology, but
information is accumulating from the neurosciences about the biological bases of 
these disorders. Recent studies addressing the neuropsychology, neuroanatomy,
neurochemistry, and molecular biology of ADHD/HKD document abnormalities in
well-defined neuroanatomical networks and neurochemical pathways. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that some regions of the frontal lobes
(anterior superior and inferior) and basal ganglia (caudate nucleus and globus
pallidus) are about 10% smaller in ADHD groups than in control groups of
children, and molecular genetic studies have shown that diagnosis of ADHD is
associated with polymorphisms in some dopamine genes (the dopamine D4 receptor
gene and the dopamine transporter gene).

Powerful advances in neuroimaging techniques have added to and refined classical 
descriptions of the neurobiology of language in adults. Recent studies have
employed these methodologies to study the nature and extent of plasticity of
language-relevant aspects of cerebral organization in adults, in early and late
bilinguals and in people who have acquired language through different modalities.
Studies of children have documented dynamic shifts in cerebral organization over 
the course of language acquisition. Each of these different approaches has
revealed constraints on the identity of the neural systems that mediate language;
these studies have also described the marked and specific effects of language
experience on the organization of these systems.

Crossmodal attention.

Author information:

Most selective attention research has considered only a single sensory modality
at a time, but in the real world, our attention must be coordinated crossmodally.
Recent studies reveal extensive crossmodal links in attention across the various 
modalities (i.e. audition, vision, touch and proprioception). Attention typically
shifts to a common location across the modalities, despite the vast differences
in their initial coding of space. These spatial synergies in attention can be
maintained even when receptors are realigned across the modalities by changes in 
posture. Some crossmodal integration can arise preattentively. The mechanisms
underlying these crossmodal links can be examined in a convergent manner by
integrating behavioural studies of normal subjects and brain-damaged patients
with neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies.

Recent evidence suggests that the behavioral phenomenon of perceptual priming and
the physiological finding of decreased neural responses with item repetition have
similar properties. Both the behavioral and neurophysiological effects show
graded changes with multiple repetition, are resistant to manipulations of
particular stimulus attributes (e.g. size and location), and occur independently 
of awareness. These and other recent findings (e.g. from functional brain imaging
in humans) suggest that perceptual priming may be mediated by decreased neural
responses associated with perceptual learning.

Object perception may involve seeing, recognition, preparation of actions, and
emotional responses--functions that human brain imaging and neuropsychology
suggest are localized separately. Perhaps because of this specialization, object 
perception is remarkably rapid and efficient. Representations of componential
structure and interpolation from view-dependent images both play a part in object
recognition. Unattended objects may be implicitly registered, but recent
experiments suggest that attention is required to bind features, to represent
three-dimensional structure, and to mediate awareness.

Recent research has clarified and revealed characteristics of perceptual and
motor decision processes in the brain. A democracy of sensory neurons
discriminate the properties of a stimulus, while competition contrasts the
attributes of stimuli across the visual field to locate conspicuous stimuli.
Salience and significance are weighed to select an object on which to focus
attention and action. Experimentally combining neural and mental chronometry has 
determined the contribution of perceptual and motor processes to the duration and
variability of behavioral reaction time. Whereas perceptual processing occupies a
relatively constant amount of time for a given stimulus condition, the processes 
of mapping particular stimuli onto the appropriate behavior and preparing the
motor response provide flexibility but introduce delay and variability in
reaction time.

Recordings of electrical and magnetic brain responses to sensory stimulation
provide high-resolution measures of the time course of early perceptual
processing. Spatio-temporal analyses of brain activity patterns during the first 
200 ms after stimulus presentation have characterized the timing of attentional
selection processes and different stages of feature encoding and pattern
analyses. Recent studies that incorporate blood flow neuroimaging techniques
provide support for mechanisms of early selection of attended visual inputs in
extrastriate cortical pathways. The spatial tuning properties of early auditory
selection have also been delineated. Electrical and magnetic responses that index
the encoding of higher-order pattern information have been identified in both
visual and auditory modalities and localized to specific cortical areas.

Neurons in the ventral premotor cortex of the monkey encode the locations of
visual, tactile, auditory and remembered stimuli. Some of these neurons encode
the locations of stimuli with respect to the arm, and may be useful for guiding
movements of the arm. Others encode the locations of stimuli with respect to the 
head, and may be useful for guiding movements of the head. We suggest that a
general principle of sensory-motor integration is that the space surrounding the 
body is represented in body-part-centered coordinates. That is, there are
multiple coordinate systems used to guide movement, each one attached to a
different part of the body. This and other recent evidence from both monkeys and 
humans suggest that the formation of spatial maps in the brain and the guidance
of limb and body movements do not proceed in separate stages but are closely
integrated in both the parietal and frontal lobes.

Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map cortical areas 
in humans have revealed many similarities with recent cortical mapping studies
from nonhuman primates as well as some striking differences. Improved methods for
analyzing, displaying and averaging fMRI data on an unfolded cortical surface
atlas are poised to improve the integration of information across burgeoning
numbers of imaging studies. By combining fMRI with electrical and passive
magnetic imaging modalities, the millisecond-to-millisecond sequence of
activation of different cortical regions elicited by an event can be imaged,
provided the regions are sufficiently far apart.

Cognitive neuroimaging maps the brain locations of mental operations. This
process is iterative, as no single study can fully characterize a mental
operation or its brain location. This iterative discovery process, in combination
with the location-reporting standard (i.e. spatial coordinates) of the cognitive 
neuroimaging community, has engendered a new form of metanalysis. Response
locations from multiple studies have been analyzed collectively so as to better
describe the spatial distribution of brain activations, with promising results.
New hypotheses regarding elementary mental operations and their respective brain 
locations are being generated and refined via metanalysis. These hypotheses are
being tested and confirmed by subsequent, prospective experiments.
Function/location metanalysis is an important new tool for hypothesis generation 
in cognitive neuroimaging. This form of metanalysis is fundamentally different
from the effect-size metanalyses prevalent in other literatures, with unique
advantages and challenges.

The hypothesis that schizophrenia results from a developmental, as opposed to a
degenerative, process affecting the cerebral cortex has become popular in current
thinking about the disorder. While many of the data gathered in support of this
hypothesis do not in themselves represent conclusive proof, an intriguing picture
is emerging from a variety of research approaches. These approaches include the
observation of minor physical anomalies, premorbid neuropsychological and social 
deficits, obstetrical complications, and exposure to adverse intrauterine events.
Morphometric brain measurement techniques and neuropathological studies have
perhaps provided more substantial support.

Recent data suggest that long-term potentiation and activity-dependent
synaptogenesis share the same mechanism at the initiation stage during which NMDA
receptor activity is necessary to increase the postsynaptic response via AMPA
receptor currents. However, several fundamental differences between the
environments of young and mature synapses and the neurons that support them
suggest that the same cellular mechanism is facilitated by very different
parameters in the young versus the mature brain.

The growth and guidance of axons involves the recognition of complex
environmental cues by receptor proteins on the surface of the growth cone and
their interpretation by cellular machinery, leading to changes in cellular
behaviour. Recent advances have demonstrated that the ligands for Eph receptor
tyrosine kinases, the ephrins, act as repulsive axon guidance cues, and that Eph 
receptors are required for correct axonal navigation in vivo. Members of the
receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family also play important roles in 
axon guidance and growth. RPTP beta and Eph receptors interact with
cell-surface-bound ligands, and there is increasing evidence that both
transmembrane ephrins and contactin, a ligand for RPTP beta, may possess an
intrinsic signalling function. Thus, the cell-contact-dependent interactions
between these receptors and ligands may lead to initiation of bidirectional
signals that regulate axonal growth and migration.

It has become increasingly evident that growth cone guidance depends on the
concerted actions of cytoskeletal proteins, molecular motors and cell adhesion
molecules. Recent studies suggest that modulation of coupling between
extracellular substrates and intracellular cytoskeletal networks via cell surface
receptors is an important mechanism for regulating directed neuronal growth.

Target selection: invasion, mapping and cell choice.

Holt CE(1), Harris WA.

Author information:

Recent research has shown that changes in the concentration of particular
molecules lead axons to invade their target, and that concentration changes in
other molecules at the borders of the target prevent axons from leaving the
target area. After invasion, topographic and lamina-specific cues guide axons to 
the correct location within the target field. At the level of a single cell or
part of a cell, the evidence raises the possibility that axon targeting might be 
a combinatorial affair whereby specific axons compare the relative concentrations
of several molecules on the surface of postsynaptic cells in order to choose a
particular target. Both proteins and carbohydrates of various classes play major 
roles in these processes.

The neural cell recognition molecule L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily implicated in embryonic brain development. L1 is engaged in complex
extracellular interactions, with multiple binding partners on cell surfaces and
in the extracellular matrix. It is the founder of a neural group of related cell 
surface receptors that share with L1 a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain that
associates with the cytoskeleton. Phenotypic analyses of human patients with
mutations in the L1 gene and characterizations of L1-deficient mice suggest that 
L1 is important for embryonic brain histogenesis, in particular the development
of axon tracts.

Numerous in vitro assays and in vivo perturbation studies have led to a model of 
neural development in which selective fasciculation helps to define accurate
axonal projections. Genetic analysis in vivo confirms the hypothesis that axonal 
fasciculation and defasciculation are controlled by adhesion mechanisms, but also
suggests that, in many cases, adhesion and guidance are separable phenomena. In
addition, receptors that control the level of tyrosine phosphorylation may play
an important role in fasciculation, suggesting that complex intracellular
pathways lie just beneath the surface.

Axon guidance at choice points.

The common theme in many recent axonal pathfinding studies, both in vertebrates
and invertebrates, is the demonstration of the importance of a balance between
positive and negative cues. The integration of multiple and often opposing
molecular interactions at each site along the axon's trajectory, especially at
choice points, helps to fine tune the directional response of its growth cone,
which continuously samples its environment for guidance cues. The dynamic
regulation of the receptors for such cues, in response to extrinsic signals, also
enhances the behavioral repertoire of growth cones at different points along
their trajectory. Some of the molecules identified as being important for axon
guidance at choice points are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates
(e.g. Robo and netrin), whereas other molecules have been identified, so far,
only in invertebrates (e.g. Comm) or vertebrates (e.g. axonin-1 and NrCAM).

Significant progress has been made recently in understanding axon guidance to and

chemoattractants in vertebrates and insects, and receptors for netrins and
semaphorins/collapsins have been identified. More evidence has accumulated that
repulsion plays a key role in guidance, including the involvement of the
ephrin/Eph receptor system in contact repulsion.

BCL-2 family members and caspases are essential components of the death machinery
in neurons. Identification of Apaf-1 as the mammalian homologue of Caenorhabditis
elegans ced-4 provided the final proof of the complete conservation of the C.
elegans programmed cell death pathway in mammals. When neurons are deprived of
trophic factors, a sequence of events is initiated, which includes a reduction in
macromolecule synthesis, elevation of c-Jun and cyclin D1, and activation of BAX.
The final episode of this sequence is the activation of caspases, which may mark 
the death commitment point at which neurons cannot be rescued by addition of
trophic factors. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the components in the
developmental programmed cell death pathway may play a critical role in
neurodegenerative disorders.

Recent progress has been made in defining the developmental mechanisms that
contribute to the diversification of motor neuron subtypes, which differ in
transcription factor gene expression and synaptic connections. These studies
suggest that progenitor cells acquire specific motor neuron identities through
the coordinate actions of multiple factors. Current evidence suggests that Sonic 
hedgehog initiates a common pathway for motor neuron differentiation, while
positionally distributed factors act to assign subtype identities.

Serotonin, social status and aggression appear to be linked in many animal
species, including humans. The linkages are complex, and, for the most part,
details relating the amine to the behavior remain obscure. During the past year, 
important advances have been made in a crustacean model system relating serotonin
and aggression. The findings include the demonstration that serotonin injections 
will cause transient reversals in the unwillingness of subordinate animals to
engage in agonistic encounters, and that at specific synaptic sites involved in
activation of escape behavior, the direction of the modulation by serotonin
depends on the social status of the animal.

Circadian clocks organize neural processes, such as motor activities, into near
24-hour oscillations and adaptively synchronize these rhythms to the solar cycle.
Recently, the first mammalian clock genes have been found. Unpredicted diversity 
in signaling pathways and clock-controlled gating of signals that modulate
timekeeping has been discovered. A diffusible clock output has been found to
control some behavioral rhythms. Consensus is emerging that circadian mechanisms 
are conserved across phylogeny, but that mammals have developed a great
complexity of controls.

Recent studies provide further support for the hypothesis that spatial
representations of limb position, target locations, and potential motor actions
are expressed in the neuronal activity in parietal cortex. In contrast,
precentral cortical activity more strongly expresses processes involved in the
selection and execution of motor actions. As a general conceptual framework,
these processes may be interpreted in terms of such formalisms as sensorimotor
transformations and 'internal models'.

different eye movement types, each with relatively independent neural circuitry: 
saccades, vestibulo-ocular reflex, optokinetic response, smooth pursuit, vergence
and, most recently added to the list, gaze-holding. Current research indicates
that many structures participate in several eye movement types, such as the
nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, frontal eye fields and pretectum. However,
the circuits appear to run in parallel rather than being integrated.

Central processing of inertial sensory information about head attitude and motion
in space is crucial for motor control. Vestibular signals are coded relative to a
non-inertial system, the head, that is virtually continuously in motion. Evidence
for transformation of vestibular signals from head-fixed sensory coordinates to
gravity-centered coordinates have been provided by studies of the
vestibulo-ocular reflex. The underlying central processing depends on otolith
afferent information that needs to be resolved in terms of head translation
related inertial forces and head attitude dependent pull of gravity. Theoretical 
solutions have been suggested, but experimental evidence is still scarce. It
appears, along these lines, that gaze control systems are intimately linked to
motor control of head attitude and posture.

Within two models of steroid-modulated behavior, sodium appetite and sexual
receptivity, novel mechanisms of steroid action have emerged. These include
interactions between different types of steroid receptors, plasticity of
synapses, activation of unliganded steroid receptors, and rapid effects or
steroids. These mechanisms highlight the diversity of steroid action in the
central nervous system.

The activity of brain serotonergic neurons in both the pontine-mesencephalic and 
medullary groups is positively correlated with the level of behavioral arousal
and/or the behavioral state. This, in turn, appears to be related to the level of
tonic motor activity, especially as manifested in antigravity muscles and other
muscle groups associated with gross motor activity. In addition, a subset of
serotonergic neurons displays a further increase in activity in association with 
repetitive, central pattern generator mediated responses. Accumulating evidence
indicates that this relation to motor activity is related both to the
co-activation of the sympathetic nervous system and to the modulation of afferent
inputs.

Neuronal activity has recently been imaged with single-cell resolution in
behaving vertebrates. This was accomplished by using fluorescent calcium
indicators in conjunction with confocal or two-photon microscopy. These optical
techniques, along with other new approaches for imaging synaptic activity, second
messengers, and neurotransmitters and their receptors offer great promise for the
study of neuronal networks at high resolution in vivo.

The study of the oculomotor periphery, the extraocular muscles and their orbital 
attachments, is undergoing a rapid expansion. This is an important progression
for both basic and clinical communities as, for too long, the ophthalmologist has
worked primarily in the periphery and the basic researcher has been occupied with
study of the central components of the oculomotor system. From recent studies, it
is clear that the morphology, cell and molecular biology, and genetics of the eye
muscles and their corresponding motoneuron pools, and muscle attachments within
the orbit are more complex than has heretofore been appreciated.

Observers moving through a textured three-dimensional world experience
potentially confusing patterns of optic flow. Recent experiments on monkeys and
humans have revealed the existence of rapid, yet cortically mediated, reflex eye 
movements that automatically single out images in the plane of fixation for

Central pattern generators are neuronal ensembles capable of producing the basic 
spatiotemporal patterns underlying 'automatic' movements (e.g. locomotion,
respiration, swallowing and defense reactions), in the absence of peripheral
feedback. Different experimental approaches, from classical electrophysiological 
and pharmacological methods to molecular and genetic ones, have been used to
understand the cellular and synaptic bases of central pattern generator
organization and reconfiguration of generator operation in behaviorally relevant 
contexts. Recently, it has been shown that the high reliability and flexibility
of central pattern generators is determined by their redundant organization.
Everything that is crucial for generator operation is determined by a number of
complementary mechanisms acting in concert; however, various mechanisms are
weighted differently in determining different aspects of central pattern
generator operation.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are allosteric ligand-gated ion channels
present in muscle and brain. Recent studies suggest that mutations altering their
functional properties may produce congenital myasthenia and familial frontal lobe
epilepsy. Current research also indicates that although nicotinic ligands often
possess addictive properties, they could serve as therapeutic agents for
Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's syndrome, as well as for schizophrenia.

Friedreich ataxia (FA), the most frequent cause of recessive ataxia, is
attributable, in most cases, to a large expansion of an intronic GAA repeat,
resulting in decreased expression of the target frataxin gene. This gene encodes 
a novel mitochondrial protein that has homologues of unknown function in yeast
and even in gram-negative bacteria. Yeast deficient in the frataxin homologue
accumulate iron in their mitochondria and show increased sensitivity to oxidative
stress. This finding suggests that FA patients suffer from a mitochondrial
dysfunction that causes free-radical toxicity, reminiscent of the clinically
similar ataxia caused by inherited isolated vitamin E deficiency.

Schizophrenia appears to be a neurodevelopmental disorder involving dysfunctional
prefrontal and temporal cortical neural systems. Recent data implicate
presynaptic changes in subcortical dopamine neurotransmission, as well as
alterations in cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. Functional
neuroimaging studies, combined with tests of neuropsychological function, suggest
that cortical abnormalities underlie the cognitive deficits associated with
schizophrenia. These deficits appear to account for much of the psychosocial
dysfunction of schizophrenia and are particularly treatment refractory. Genetic
studies have implicated several minor susceptibility loci; however, the clinical 
impact of these loci on the neurobiology of schizophrenia is still unclear. The
use of neurobiological traits as phenotypes, such as cognitive deficits and
cortical abnormalities, in genetic linkage studies may facilitate the
identification of loci that underlie the most debilitating features of
schizophrenia.

At least 15 genes with defects responsible for various forms of inherited retinal
disease involving photoreceptor loss have been identified over the past eight
years. Several of the genes were first considered as candidates for study because
of their involvement in murine retinal disease, others because of their
chromosomal loci. In two cases, novel genes were uncovered by positional cloning.
Based on reports of disease loci for which no gene has yet been found, more than 
twice as many genes remain to be identified in this genetically heterogeneous
group of diseases.

Chronic administration of opiates or cocaine has been shown to alter the activity
or expression of diverse types of cellular proteins in specific target neurons
within the central nervous system. Prominent examples include signaling proteins,
such as receptors, G proteins, second-messenger synthetic enzymes, and protein
kinases. It is now increasingly possible to relate particular molecular
adaptations to specific behavioral actions of drugs of abuse in animal models of 
addiction. In addition, recent work has focused on a role for transcription
factors, and the associated alterations in gene expression, in mediating part of 
this long-lasting, drug-induced molecular and behavioral plasticity.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies affect a variety of vertebrates,
including humans. While scrapie has been enzootic in sheep for centuries, bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) appeared only some 12 years ago but rapidly
became epizootic. It is not clear whether BSE originated in cattle as a rare
spontaneous event or whether it stems from sheep, but its spread is clearly due
to feeding of cattle-derived contaminated bone and meat meal. Recent evidence
links the appearance of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans to
consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle-derived products.

The importance of vision in the behavior of animals, from invertebrates to
primates, has led to a good deal of interest in how projection neurons in the
retina make specific connections with targets in the brain. Recent research has
focused on the cellular interactions occurring between retinal ganglion cell
(RGC) axons and specific glial and neuronal populations in the embryonic brain
during formation of the mouse optic chiasm. These interactions appear to be
involved both in determining the position of the optic chiasm on the ventral
diencephalon (presumptive hypothalamus) and in ipsilateral and contralateral RGC 
axon pathfinding, development events fundamental to binocular vision in the adult
animal.

Green fluorescent fusion proteins, which can be visualized in the unperturbed
environment of a living cell, have become important reporter molecules for
studying protein localization and trafficking within secretory and endocytic
membranes of living cells. They have been used in a wide variety of applications,
including time-lapse imaging, double-labeling and photobleach experiments.
Results from such work are clarifying the steps involved in the formation,
translocation and fusion of transport intermediates, are defining the roles for
microtubules in membrane transport, and are providing insights into the
mechanisms of protein retention and localization within organelles. In so doing, 
they have changed our thinking about the temporal and spatial relationships
between subcellular membrane structures and the morphogenesis of secretory and
endocytic organelles.

During myelination, oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS
synthesise myelin-specific proteins and lipids for the assembly of the axon
myelin sheath. A dominant class of lipids in the myelin bilayer are the
glycolipids, which include galactocerebroside (GalC), galactosulfatide (sGalC)
and galactodiglyceride (GalDG). A promising approach for unravelling the roles
played by various lipids in the myelin membrane involves knocking out the genes
encoding important enzymes in lipid biosynthesis. The recent ablation of the
ceramide galactosyltransferase ( cgt) gene in mice is the first example. The cgt 
gene encodes a key enzyme in glycolipid biosynthesis. Its absence causes
glycolipid deficiency in the lipid bilayer, breakdown of axon insulation and loss
of saltatory conduction. Additional knock-out studies should provide important
insights into the various functions of glycolipids in myelinogenesis and myelin
structure.

Recent studies of mutations of Drosophila proteins implicated in synaptic

pathways in which they function. Analysis of mutant embryos lacking syntaxin or
synaptobrevin suggests that these proteins perform distinct functions after
vesicle docking with the presynaptic membrane. In addition, characterization of
Drosophila endocytotic mutants provides in vivo evidence for the presence of
different endocytotic pathways at a single synapse.

The unusual carbohydrate polysialic acid (PSA), attached uniquely to neural cell 
adhesion molecule (NCAM) through a developmentally regulated process, modulates
neural cell interactions. Major advances in the past two years have increased our
understanding of PSA biosynthesis and regulation. Of particular interest is the
cloning of the genes encoding polysialyltransferases (PSTs) and the finding that 
a single enzyme is able to confer polysialylation to NCAM. The electrical
activity of neurons and transmembrane signalling are probably major players in
controlling both PSA biosynthesis and its expression at the cell surface. A
direct causal relationship between PSA expression and activity-induced synaptic
plasticity has been reported.

Since the discovery of orientation selectivity by Hubel and Wiesel, the
mechanisms responsible for this remarkable operation in the visual cortex have
been controversial. Experimental studies over the past year have highlighted the 
contribution of feedforward thalamo-cortical afferents, as proposed originally by
Hubel and Wiesel, but they have also indicated that this contribution alone is
insufficient to account for the sharp orientation tuning observed in the visual
cortex. Recent advances in understanding the functional architecture of local
cortical circuitry have led to new proposals for the involvement of intracortical
recurrent excitation and inhibition in orientation selectivity. Establishing how 
these two mechanisms work together remains an important experimental and
theoretical challenge.

Recent studies of the improvement of perceptual performance as a function of
training - perceptual learning - have provided new insights into the neuronal
substrates of this type of skill learning in the adult brain. Issues such as
where in the brain, when and under what conditions practice-related changes occur
are under investigation. The results of these studies suggest that a behaviorally
relevant degree of plasticity is retained in the adult cortex, even within early,
low-level representations in sensory and motor processing streams. The
acquisition and retention of skills may share many characteristics with the
functional plasticity subserving early-life learning and development. While the
specificity of learning provides localization constraints, an important clue to
the nature of the underlying neuronal changes is the time course of learning.

Despite their relatively simple nervous systems, insects display a rich
behavioural repertoire, in which vision plays a major role. In the past two
years, much knowledge has been gained about how insects are capable of a variety 
of flexible, visually guided tasks that involve a high level of complexity. From 
long-range navigation to median-range orientation and close-up recognition,
insects apply different strategies that complement each other, that are used
sequentially during their approach flight towards their goals, and that may
replace each other, depending on the salience of, and the attention towards,
particular visual cues.

Our understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of transduction of painful 
stimuli has burgeoned in the past year, mainly as a result of studies on isolated
sensory neurones in culture. The ion channels underlying neuronal responses to
noxious heat, to protons and to ATP have recently been characterized. The typical
increase in nociceptor sensitivity produced by tissue damage has been found to be
mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms. In the first, bradykinin augments
the current activated by heat through a mechanism that involves activation of
protein kinase C. In a second sensitization mechanism, prostaglandin E2 alters
the voltage threshold of several ion channels, including a novel
tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na+ channel, in such a way that initiation of action
potentials is facilitated.

Unlike any other known sensory receptor, the hair cell uses positive feedback to 
augment the stimulus to which it responds. In the internal ears of many
vertebrates, hair cells amplify the inputs to their mechanosensitive hair
bundles. Outer hair cells of the mammalian cochlea display a unique form of
somatal motility that may underlie their contribution to amplification. In other 
receptor organs, hair cells may effect amplification by hair-bundle movements
driven by the activity of myosin or of transduction channels. Recent work has
demonstrated the presence of several myosin isozymes in hair bundles, confirmed
that bundles display myosin ATPase activity, and shown that the work performed by
myosin molecules could account for one aspect of the amplificatory process.

Recent findings have altered radically our thinking about the functional role of 
the parietal cortex. According to this view, the parietal lobe consists of a
multiplicity of areas with specific connections to the frontal lobe. These areas,
together with the frontal areas to which they are connected, mediate distinct
sensorimotor transformations related to the control of hand, arm, eye or head
movements. Space perception is not unitary, but derives from the joint activity
of the fronto-parietal circuits that control actions requiring space computation.

The recent application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visual 
studies has begun to elucidate how the human visual system is anatomically and
functionally organized. Bottom-up hierarchical processing among visual cortical
areas has been revealed in experiments that have correlated brain activations
with human perceptual experience. Top-down modulation of activity within visual
cortical areas has been demonstrated through studies of higher cognitive
processes such as attention and memory.

Natural odors are complex, multidimensional stimuli. Yet, they are learned and
recognized by the brain with a great deal of specificity and accuracy. This
implies that central olfactory circuits are optimized to encode these complex
chemical patterns and to store and recognize their neural representations. What
shape this optimization takes remains somewhat mysterious. Recent results from
studies focusing on odor representation in the first olfactory relay (i.e. one
synapse downstream of the receptor neurons) suggest a great deal of order and
precision in the spatial and temporal features of odor representation. Whether
these spatio-temporal features of neural activity are an essential part of the
code for odors (i.e. whether these features are essential for the downstream
decoding circuits) remains a central issue.

Weakly electric fish are able to resolve intensity differences of the order of
0.1% and timing differences of the order of nanoseconds during an electrical

The faithful preservation of acoustic timing information, as signals are passed
from one synaptic level to another, requires a convergence of morphological,
biophysical, and biochemical specializations in auditory neurons. Recent studies 
have focused on the adaptive membrane properties of neurons in the auditory
brainstem. These include analyses of neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated
channels, as well as the mechanisms of transmitter release and its modulation.
The molecular composition of the relevant proteins are now being demonstrated,
including the glutamate receptor Dflop (GluR-Dflop) subunit of AMPA receptors and
members of the Kv1 and Kv3 families of potassium channels.

Recent genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological evidence has provided
insights into the molecular identity of the substance responsible for bleaching
desensitization in vision. Studies examining the molecular defects that cause
delayed dark adaptation suggest that the desensitizing substance is recognized by
rhodopsin kinase and/or arrestin and, therefore, is probably a complex comprising
all-trans-retinal and opsin.

Exocytosis in neurons requires proteins known as SNAREs, membrane proteins that
have now been implicated in many intracellular fusion events. SNAREs assemble
into stable ternary complexes that are dissociated by the ATPase NSF
(N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), working together with SNAPs (soluble NSF
attachment proteins). Recent results have shed new light on the mechanisms
underlying SNARE (SNAP receptor) complex assembly and disassembly, and suggest
changes in models that relate these reactions to vesicle docking and fusion.

Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is followed rapidly by reinternalization and
recycling of their membranes. Recent studies have confirmed the key role of
clathrin-mediated endocytosis in synaptic vesicle reformation and have identified
new proteins that participate in this process. In addition, growing evidence
suggests that lipids, primarily phosphoinositides, play an important role in
synaptic vesicle recycling.

Cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) cation channels are critical for signal
transduction in vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Members of the CNG
channel gene family have now been cloned from a number of species, from
Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. An important advance has been the discovery
that CNG channels are present in many neurons of the mammalian brain. CNG
channels act as molecular links between G-protein-coupled cascades,
Ca2+-signalling systems, and gaseous messenger pathways. Perhaps most striking
are recent data implicating CNG channels in both developmental and synaptic
plasticity.

Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and/or related nucleotides act at both ionotropic
(P2X) and metabotropic (P2Y) receptors. P2X receptor subunits (P2X1-P2X7) form
ligand-gated cation channels, as homomultimers or heteromultimers. Recent work
indicates that P2X3 subunits participate in channels expressed by nociceptive
sensory neurons, and that the second of the two transmembrane domains of each
subunit contributes to the ion permeation pathway. P2X7 subunits form large
cytolytic pores in addition to cation channels; they have been found in
macrophages and brain microglia. P2Y receptors form a distinct subset of
G-protein-coupled receptors; most couple through G proteins to phospholipase C,
but inhibition of adenylate cyclase and N-type Ca2+ channels, and activation of
K+ channels also occurs. Expressed P2Y receptors have generally been
distinguished pharmacologically by the rank order of effectiveness of agonists;
some prefer pyrimidines to purines. Recent studies suggest that it is important
to use purified nucleotides in such classifications. Several P2Y receptors have a
very widespread tissue distribution.

Activation specific tyrosine kinase receptors by neurotrophins accounts for the
longest known biological actions of the neurotrophins, in particular the
promotion of neuronal survival. However, recent studies have revealed that nerve 
growth factor, the neurotrophin regarded as best understood, also activates a
signalling pathway by binding to the neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR). This
receptor belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and lacks intrinsic
catalytic activity. The p75(NTR) receptor binds all neurotrophins with nanomolar 
affinity; however, nerve growth factor seems to be uniquely able to activate it, 
causing the death of trkA-negative neurons during normal development. Thus, nerve
growth factor prevents programmed cell death through its receptor TrkA, but
promotes it by signalling through p75(NTR).

Ca2+ is an important signal-transduction molecule that plays a role in many
intracellular signaling pathways. Recent advances have indicated that in neurons,
Ca2+-controlled signaling mechanisms cooperate in order to discriminate amongst
incoming cellular inputs. Ca2+-dependent transcriptional events can thereby be
made selectively responsive to bursts of synaptic activity of specific intensity 
or duration.

Inositol phospholipids are a focus of renewed interest with the discovery of
their unanticipated pivotal roles in membrane trafficking events. Reversible
phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol generates spatially localized signals on 
membranes that recruit or activate proteins essential for cell membrane budding, 
fission and fusion. Recent advances have taken place in the characterization of
lipid kinases and phosphoinositide-regulated effector proteins, and in the
elucidation of phospholipase D mediated mechanisms involving ADP ribosylation
factor and Rho family proteins. The roles played by phosphoinositides in aspects 
of secretory granule formation, fusion and endocytosis indicate the importance of
phosphorylated lipids for neurotransmitter release.

Formation of the neuromuscular junction requires a series of reciprocal inductive

precise juxtaposition of a highly specialized presynaptic nerve terminal with a

has long been thought to play a key role during neuromuscular junction formation,
the molecular mechanisms underlying its actions are only now coming into focus,
following the recent discovery that agrin acts via the MuSK receptor tyrosine
kinase.

The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is a ligand-gated Ca2+-release
channel on intracellular Ca2+ store sites (such as the endoplasmic reticulum),
and plays an important role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling in a wide variety of 
cell types. Recent studies have shown that binding of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) to InsP3R isoforms is differentially regulated by
Ca2+, and that InsP3R functions are finely regulated by phosphorylation via
tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C, by dephosphorylation via calcineurin, and 
by binding to FKBP (FK506-binding protein). In addition, transient receptor
potential (TRP) and TRP-like proteins appear to couple conformationally with the 
InsP3R for capacitative Ca2+ entry. The importance of InsP3R signaling in
neuronal function has been demonstrated by gene targeting in mice and by studies 
of T-cell receptor signaling, apoptosis, meiotic maturation, and cytokinesis.

The complex anatomy of neurons demands a high degree of functional organization. 
Therefore, membrane receptors and ion channels are often localized to selected
subcellular sites and coupled to specific signal transduction machineries. PDZ
domains have come into focus as protein interaction modules that mediate the
binding of a class of submembraneous proteins to membrane receptors and ion
channels and thus subserve these organizational aspects. The structures of two
PDZ domains have been resolved, which has led to a structural understanding of
the specificity of interactions of various PDZ domains with their respective
partners. The functional implications of PDZ domain interactions are now being
addressed in vitro and in vivo.

In mammals, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) family of enzymes is
assembled from the products of four regulatory and two catalytic subunit genes,
all of which are expressed in neurons. Specific isoforms of PKA display
differences in biochemical properties and subcellular localization, but it has
been difficult to ascribe specific physiological functions to any given isoform. 
The recent development of gene knockout and transgenic mouse models has allowed
for a more integrated examination of the in vivo roles of specific PKA isoforms
in gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and behaviour.

Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) mediates certain aspects of synaptic plasticity and 
neurotoxicity associated with NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Neuronal NO synthase
contains a modular protein-protein interaction motif, termed the PDZ domain, that

Recent studies have identified various forms of active dendritic signals that may
contribute to neuronal integration. One of the most remarkable findings is the
demonstration of highly localized Ca2+ transients that are limited to small
dendritic segments and even to single dendritic spines. In addition, through use 
of the powerful two-photon excitation imaging technique, it has been possible to 
reveal the existence of dendritic Ca2+ signals under in vivo conditions. Finally,
active backpropagation of action potentials into dendrites has been shown to
boost dendritic Ca2+ signals supralinearly and, thus, to contribute to the
induction of long-term potentiation.

Phosphorylation of ligand-gated ion channels is recognised as a potentially
important mechanism for short- and long-term modulation of ion-channel function. 
Following the discovery of numerous sites of phosphorylation on ligand-gated ion 
channel proteins, recent studies have demonstrated that neurotransmitter-induced 
activation of serine/threonine, tyrosine and other kinases can result in the
modulation of glutamate, type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and glycine
receptors. These findings may have important consequences for our understanding

Coincidence detection and crosstalk between signal transduction systems play very
important regulatory roles in the nervous system, particularly in the regulation 
of transcription. Coupling of the Ca2+ and cAMP regulatory systems by
calmodulin-regulated adenylyl cyclases is hypothesized to be important for some
forms of synaptic plasticity, neuroendocrine function, and olfactory detection.
Recent studies of a mutant mouse deficient in type I calmodulin-sensitive
adenylyl cyclase have provided the first evidence that adenylyl cyclases are
important for synaptic plasticity, as well as for learning and memory in

For the first time, there is a pathogenic hypothesis of schizophrenia based upon 
reasonable empirical data. The hypothesis is that schizophrenia is a disorder
arising from aberrant brain development. The neurodevelopmental view of
schizophrenia is supported by neuropathological, epidemiological and clinical
findings. Here, the evidence in favour of the model is summarized, together with 
a consideration of its weaknesses.

A rich tradition of normative psychophysics has identified two ubiquitous
properties of interval timing: the scalar property, a strong form of Weber's law,
and ratio comparison mechanisms. Finding the neural substrate of these properties
is a major challenge for neurobiology. Recently, advances have been made in our
understanding of the brain structures important for timing, especially the basal 
ganglia and the cerebellum. Surgical intervention or diseases of the cerebellum
generally result in increased variability in temporal processing, whereas both
clock and memory effects are seen for neurotransmitter interventions, lesions and
diseases of the basal ganglia. We propose that cerebellar dysfunction may induce 
deregulation of tonic thalamic tuning, which disrupts gating of the mnemonic
temporal information generated in the basal ganglia through
striato-thalamo-cortical loops.

A synthesis of older and recent work on mnemonic functions of the basal ganglia
in rats, monkeys and humans emphasizes a reciprocal relationship of the caudate
nucleus and putamen with the cerebral cortex, which mediates the memory of
consistent relationships between stimuli and responses (sometimes called habits) 
that often involve relationships between the individual and its environment
(egocentric memory). Evidence at several levels of analysis (including
neuroplastic synaptic changes, activity of single neurons, and behavioral changes
caused by lesions or neurochemical manipulations) implicate dopamine release from
nigro-striatal neurons in the reinforcement, or strengthening, of neural
representations in the basal ganglia.

Recent autopsy and/or quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies of autistic
patients have identified agenesis of the superior olive, dysgenesis of the facial
nucleus, reduced numbers of Purkinje neurons, hypoplasia of the brainstem and
posterior cerebellum, and increased neuron-packing density of the medial,
cortical and central nuclei of the amygdala and the medial septum. As
neurogenesis occurs for these different neuron types during approximately the
fifth week of gestation, the possibility is raised that this may be a 'window of 
vulnerability' for autism; the likely etiologic heterogeneity of autism suggests 
that other windows of vulnerability are also possible.

Over the past year, a number of conceptual and mathematical models of the basal
ganglia and their interactions with other areas of the brain have appeared in the
literature. Even though the models each differ in significant ways, several
computational principles, such as convergence, recurrence and competition, appear
to have emerged as common themes of information processing in the basal ganglia. 
Simulation studies of these models have provoked new types of questions at the
many levels of inquiry linking biophysics to behavior.

The serotonergic system appears to play a role in behaviors that involve a high
cognitive demand and in memory improvement or recovery from impaired cognitive
performance, as made evident after administration of serotonin 5-HT2A/5-HT2C or
5-HT4 receptor agonists or 5-HT1A or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. These serotonin 
receptor subtypes are localized on 'cognitive' pathways, with the hippocampus and
frontal cortex as the main target structures. A better understanding of the role 
played by these and other serotonin receptor subtypes in cognition is likely to
result from the recent availability of new specific ligands and new molecular
tools, such as gene knock-out and transgenic mice.

The allocation of behavior among competing activities and goal objects depends on
the payoffs they provide. Payoff is evaluated among multiple dimensions,
including intensity, rate, delay, and kind. Recent findings suggest that by
triggering a stream of action potentials in myelinated, medial forebrain bundle
axons, rewarding electrical brain stimulation delivers a meaningful intensity
signal to the process that computes payoff.

Information related to rewards is processed by a limited number of brain
structures. Recent studies have demonstrated that dopamine neurons respond to
appetitive events, such as primary rewards and reward-predicting stimuli. Rather 
than responding unconditionally, these neurons signal deviations from the
prediction of future appetitive events. These reward-related responses correspond
formally to concepts of behavioral and computational learning theories and may
thus constitute teaching signals for appetitive learning.

Improved neuroanatomical knowledge, technical and methodological innovations
(such as PET), and more refined conceptualizations of memory have inspired a
reappraisal of theoretical beliefs regarding the role of the hippocampus in
memory. In the past few years, it has become apparent that the influence of the
medial temporal lobe regions extends beyond memory and that memory processes
(such as encoding, consolidation and retrieval) involve not only the hippocampus 
and the medial temporal and diencephalic regions, but also widely distributed
neocortical and perhaps even cerebellar regions.

Results from recent studies of retrograde amnesia following damage to the
hippocampal complex of human and non-human subjects have shown that retrograde
amnesia is extensive and can encompass much of a subject's lifetime; the degree
of loss may depend upon the type of memory assessed. These and other findings
suggest that the hippocampal formation and related structures are involved in
certain forms of memory (e.g. autobiographical episodic and spatial memory) for
as long as they exist and contribute to the transformation and stabilization of
other forms of memory stored elsewhere in the brain.

In the past year, several tests of the hypothesis that NMDA-dependent hippocampal
long-term potentiation (LTP) underlies learning have been reported. Data from
mutant mice point to a potential role for NMDA-dependent LTP in hippocampal place
cell function and spatial learning, but evidence for a causal relation is not yet
available. Other studies have shown that robust spatial learning is possible
without NMDA-dependent hippocampal LTP. Although the current evidence for the
role of LTP in learning is mixed, LTP remains the most promising neural mechanism
for associative learning. Several new experimental approaches are now available
for future research.

Research on spatial problem-solving over the past two years has linked the
hippocampus to path integration, that is, the use of movement-related cues to
guide spatial behavior. Path integration may underlie the forms of place learning
that are impaired by hippocampal damage. It remains a challenge to determine
whether path integration is the central function of the hippocampus or but one of
many.

Visual attention can be considered from the perspective of distributed brain
activity engendered by visual input. We propose that visual objects compete for
representation in multiple brain systems, sensory and motor, cortical and
subcortical. Competition is integrated, however, such that multiple systems
converge, working on the different properties and action implications of a
selected object. Top-down priming biases competition towards objects relevant to 
current behaviour. Recent single-unit studies have shown widespread suppression
of ignored-object representations in extrastriate cortex, and patterns of spatial
and nonspatial priming by task relevance. Human and monkey lesion studies have
demonstrated the strong integration tendency of different spatial and nonspatial 
systems, also revealed in recent studies of normal behaviour. In many cases, no
unitary brain system may be responsible for unitary cognitive events such as
attention. Such events may emerge as distinct systems converge to work on common 
cognitive problems.

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that certain populations of neurons switch
their survival requirements from one neurotrophin to another during an early
stage in their development. Although there is good evidence for neurotrophin
switching in sensory neurons, the evidence for switching in sympathetic neurons
has become more controversial, as has the identity of the factors that regulate
their responsiveness to particular neurotrophins.

Neuroepithelial cells, the progenitors to the CNS neurons and glia, undergo both 
symmetric and asymmetric divisions. Symmetric divisions underlie the
proliferation of neuroepithelial cells that predominates early in CNS
development. Asymmetric divisions are thought to generate the cell types derived 
from neuroepithelial cells, such as neurons. Insight into the mechanism of
asymmetric division of neuroepithelial cells has come from two lines of research,
the study of their epithelial polarity and the analysis of the expression of
vertebrate homologues of proteins known to be involved in cell fate determination
in Drosophila.

Several major advances in the understanding of the regulation of vertebrate
neurogenesis by members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family have

and shown to convert non-neuronal fate to neuronal fate when expressed
ectopically. In particular, studies on NeuroD and Neurogenin suggest a regulatory
pathway, providing powerful molecular tools to study vertebrate neurogenesis.

As neuromuscular junctions form in vertebrate skeletal muscle, nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) become concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane.
The nerve directs this redistribution, using multiple signals to regulate AChRs
at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Recent studies in vitro
have led to the identification of candidate nerve-derived signaling molecules
(such as agrin, ARIA/neuregulin, and calcitonin gene-related peptide) and
components of their intramuscular signaling pathways (including dystroglycan,
MuSK, erbB kinases, utrophin, and rapsyn). Studies of knock-out mice are now
making it possible to test which signals and pathways are responsible for
postsynaptic differentiation in vivo.

The neuregulins are a family of closely related proteins that play important
roles in neural and cardiac development, as well as in mammary carcinogenesis.
The pleiotropic activities of these molecules are transduced by a set of receptor
protein tyrosine kinases that exhibit structural similarity to the receptor for
epidermal growth factor. Recent results have demonstrated essential roles for the
neuregulins and their receptors in regulating cell number, determining cell fate,
and establishing pattern in the developing central and peripheral nervous
systems.

Recent genetic evidence suggests that tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases 
can control the guidance of specific growth cones. Within a family of related
phosphatases or kinases, individual members can have partially redundant
functions. Receptor phosphatases can work together at one guidance choice point, 
but in opposition at another. The specific combination of kinases and
phosphatases active in a growth cone may be an important determinant of pathway
choice. One mechanism by which these proteins could control guidance decisions is
through regulation of adhesion between growth cones and axons.

A major issue in development is to understand how local heterogeneities are
interpreted to determine specific cell fates. The sense organs of Drosophila
provide an accessible system for addressing this issue. Most sense organs
comprise four types of cells, and their differentiation is the outcome of a
complex developmental programme comprising several steps. Recent results
illuminate, for several of these steps, the nature of the local heterogeneities
and the mechanism used to interpret them in terms of cell fate decisions.

At gastrulation, vertebrate ectoderm is competent to differentiate into either
neural tissue or epidermis. Several soluble factors that can neuralize ectoderm
in explant cultures have been isolated. Alternatively, neuralization can be
achieved by dissociating the cells of the blastula ectoderm. These various
treatments appear to neuralize by blocking or diluting out the action of an
epidermal-inducing factor. Recent results demonstrate that bone morphogenetic
protein 4 (BMP-4), a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)
ligand superfamily, is a potent neural inhibitor and epidermal inducer and may
represent the endogenous epidermal-inducing factor.

The continued functional characterization of Eph-related receptors and ligands
has provided further information toward an understanding of the mechanisms
controlling the retinotectal projection. Recent in vivo analyses have
strengthened the idea that Engrailed defines the positional identity of the
tectum along the anteroposterior axis, possibly by regulating the expression of
Eph family members.
