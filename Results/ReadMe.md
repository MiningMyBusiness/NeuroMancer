# Data and visualization output files
This folder contains all output files or results from the keyword analysis.

## File descriptions
[AllChangingWords_2D.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/AllChangingWords_2D.png) and [AllChangingWords_2D_zoom.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/AllChangingWords_2D_zoom.png) are plots of the coefficients of the best fit lines for the keywords that were found to change significantly in frequency over the last 20 years. The x-axis is the slope and the y-axis is the y-intercept of the best fits for each word. The location of a keyword in this plot can tell you where it started and if it increased or decreased in frequency over the last 20 years. 

[AllKeywords.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/AllKeywords.csv) and [AllYears.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/AllYears.csv) are lists of all the keywords from these abstracts found and their corresponding years.

[brainCloud.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/brainCloud.png) is a keyword word cloud with all keywords found over the last 20 years. 

[brainCloud_new.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/brainCloud_new.png) is a keyword word cloud of keywords from Jan 2012 - Dec 2016.

[braiCloud_old.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/brainCloud_old.png) is a keyword word cloud of keywords from Jan 1997 - Dec 2001. 

[changingWords.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/changingWords.csv) and [changingWordCoefs.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/changingWordCoefs.csv) are the keywords which had significantly increasing or decreasing trends over the last 20 years and the coefficients of the linear fit for their change over the last 20 years. 

[DecreaseConnectedness.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/DecreaseConnectedness.png) is the connectivity metric of decreasing words to decreasing words and increasing words to decreasing words. I further explain this in the README.md file in the main folder. 

[DecreasingWords.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/DecreasingWords.png) plots the points and linear fit for the five words with most decreasing trends in the last 20 years. 

[ImpWords.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/ImpWords.csv) is a list of all keywords that were mentioned at least 20 times in the last 20 years. 

[IncreaseConnectedness.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/IncreaseConnectedness.png) is the connectivity metric of decreasing words to increasing words and increasing words to increasing words. Please refer to the main README.md file for a full explanation of this figure. 

[IncreasingWords.png](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/IncreasingWords.png) plots the points and linear fit for the five words with most increasing trends in the last 20 years.

[wordCountArray.csv](https://github.com/MiningMyBusiness/NeuroMancer/raw/master/Results/wordCountArray.csv) is the connectivity matrix of keywords to each other which was used to compute the connectivity metric to determine if decreasing keywords and increasing keywords were two seperate groups of words.
