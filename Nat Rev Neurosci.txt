Although it is well established that all brain regions contain various neuronal
subtypes with different functions, astrocytes have traditionally been thought to 
be homogenous. However, recent evidence has shown that astrocytes in the
mammalian CNS display distinct inter- and intra-regional features, as well as
functional diversity. In the CNS, astrocyte processes fill the local environment 
in non-overlapping domains. Therefore, a potential advantage of region-specified 
astrocytes might be their capacity to regulate local development or optimize
local neural circuit function. An overview of the regional heterogeneity of
neuron-astrocyte interactions indicates novel ways in which they could regulate
normal neurological function and shows how they might become dysregulated in
disease.

Glucocorticoid stress hormones are crucially involved in modulating mnemonic
processing of emotionally arousing experiences. They enhance the consolidation of
new memories, including those that extinguish older memories, but impair the
retrieval of information stored in long-term memory. As strong aversive memories 
lie at the core of several fear-related disorders, including post-traumatic
stress disorder and phobias, the memory-modulating properties of glucocorticoids 
have recently become of considerable translational interest. Clinical trials have
provided the first evidence that glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies aimed at 
attenuating aversive memories might be helpful in the treatment of fear-related
disorders. Here, we review important advances in the understanding of how
glucocorticoids mediate stress effects on memory processes, and discuss the
translational potential of these new conceptual insights.

Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use, manipulate and generalize
knowledge that is acquired over the lifespan to support innumerable verbal and
non-verbal behaviours. This Review summarizes key findings and issues arising
from a decade of research into the neurocognitive and neurocomputational
underpinnings of this ability, leading to a new framework that we term controlled
semantic cognition (CSC). CSC offers solutions to long-standing queries in
philosophy and cognitive science, and yields a convergent framework for
understanding the neural and computational bases of healthy semantic cognition
and its dysfunction in brain disorders.

Neurofeedback is a psychophysiological procedure in which online feedback of
neural activation is provided to the participant for the purpose of
self-regulation. Learning control over specific neural substrates has been shown 
to change specific behaviours. As a progenitor of brain-machine interfaces,
neurofeedback has provided a novel way to investigate brain function and
neuroplasticity. In this Review, we examine the mechanisms underlying
neurofeedback, which have started to be uncovered. We also discuss how
neurofeedback is being used in novel experimental and clinical paradigms from a
multidisciplinary perspective, encompassing neuroscientific, neuroengineering and
learning-science viewpoints.

Chronic pain is not simply a temporal continuum of acute pain. Studies on
functional plasticity in neural circuits of pain have provided mechanistic
insights and linked various modulatory factors to a change in perception and
behaviour. However, plasticity also occurs in the context of structural
remodelling and reorganisation of synapses, cells and circuits, potentially
contributing to the long-term nature of chronic pain. This Review discusses
maladaptive structural plasticity in neural circuits of pain, spanning multiple
anatomical and spatial scales in animal models and human patients, and addresses 
key questions on structure-function relationships.

The human subcortex is a densely populated part of the brain, of which only 7% of
the individual structures are depicted in standard MRI atlases. In vivo MRI of
the subcortex is challenging owing to its anatomical complexity and its deep
location in the brain. The technical advances that are needed to reliably uncover
this 'terra incognita' call for an interdisciplinary human neuroanatomical
approach. We discuss the emerging methods that could be used in such an approach 
and the incorporation of the data that are generated from these methods into
model-based cognitive neuroscience frameworks.

The function of neural circuits and networks can be controlled, in part, by
modulating the synchrony of their components' activities. Network hypersynchrony 
and altered oscillatory rhythmic activity may contribute to cognitive
abnormalities in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this condition, network activities
that support cognition are altered decades before clinical disease onset, and
these alterations predict future pathology and brain atrophy. Although the
precise causes and pathophysiological consequences of these network alterations
remain to be defined, interneuron dysfunction and network abnormalities have
emerged as potential mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in AD and related
disorders. Here, we explore the concept that modulating these mechanisms may help
to improve brain function in these conditions.

Integrins are a large family of extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors. In the
developing and adult brain, many integrins are present at high levels at
synapses. The tetrapartite structure of synapses - which comprises presynaptic
and postsynaptic neurons, the ECM and glial processes - places synaptic integrins
in an excellent position to sense dynamic changes in the synaptic environment and
use this information to coordinate further changes in synapse structure and
function that will shape neural circuit properties. Recent developments in our
understanding of the cellular and physiological roles of integrins, which range
from control of neural process outgrowth and synapse formation to regulation of
synaptic plasticity and memory, enable us to attempt a synthesis of synaptic
integrin function.

It is becoming clear that the manner by which the immune response resolves or
contains infection by a pathogen varies according to the tissue that is affected.
Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus,
the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling
infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for
this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance
of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune
response - when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS -
provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including
those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate 
long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.

The mirror mechanism is a basic brain mechanism that transforms sensory
representations of others' behaviour into one's own motor or visceromotor
representations concerning that behaviour. According to its location in the
brain, it may fulfil a range of cognitive functions, including action and emotion
understanding. In each case, it may enable a route to knowledge of others'
behaviour, which mainly depends on one's own motor or visceromotor
representations.

Nonrandom chromosomal conformations, including promoter-enhancer loopings that
bypass kilobases or megabases of linear genome, provide a crucial layer of
transcriptional regulation and move vast amounts of non-coding sequence into the 
physical proximity of genes that are important for neurodevelopment, cognition
and behaviour. Activity-regulated changes in the neuronal '3D genome' could
govern transcriptional mechanisms associated with learning and plasticity, and
loop-bound intergenic and intronic non-coding sequences have been implicated in
psychiatric and adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies have begun 
to clarify the roles of spatial genome organization in normal and abnormal
cognition.

Most research on mind-wandering has characterized it as a mental state with
contents that are task unrelated or stimulus independent. However, the dynamics
of mind-wandering - how mental states change over time - have remained largely
neglected. Here, we introduce a dynamic framework for understanding
mind-wandering and its relationship to the recruitment of large-scale brain
networks. We propose that mind-wandering is best understood as a member of a
family of spontaneous-thought phenomena that also includes creative thought and
dreaming. This dynamic framework can shed new light on mental disorders that are 
marked by alterations in spontaneous thought, including depression, anxiety and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Topoisomerases and the regulation of neural function.

McKinnon PJ(1).

Tennessee 38105, USA.

Topoisomerases are unique enzymes that regulate torsional stress in DNA to enable
essential genome functions, including DNA replication and transcription. Although
all cells in an organism require topoisomerases to maintain normal function, the 
nervous system in particular shows a vital need for these enzymes. Indeed, a
range of inherited human neurologic syndromes, including neurodegeneration,
schizophrenia and intellectual impairment, are associated with aberrant
topoisomerase function. Much remains unknown regarding the tissue-specific
function of neural topoisomerases or the connections between these enzymes and
disease aetiology. Precisely how topoisomerases regulate genome dynamics within
the nervous system is therefore a crucial research question.

Circuit modules linking internal states and social behaviour in flies and mice.

Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.

Goal-directed social behaviours such as mating and fighting are associated with
scalable and persistent internal states of emotion, motivation, arousal or drive.
How those internal states are encoded and coupled to behavioural decision making 
and action selection is not clear. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster and 
mice have identified circuit nodes that have causal roles in the control of
innate social behaviours. Remarkably, in both species, these relatively small
groups of neurons can influence both aggression and mating, and also play a part 
in the encoding of internal states that promote these social behaviours. These
similarities may be superficial and coincidental, or may reflect conserved or
analogous neural circuit modules for the control of social behaviours in flies
and mice.

General anaesthesia is usually considered to safely induce a reversible brain
state allowing the performance of surgery under optimal conditions. An increasing
number of clinical and experimental observations, however, suggest that
anaesthetic drugs, especially when they are administered at the extremes of age, 
can trigger long-term morphological and functional alterations in the brain.
Here, we review available mechanistic data linking general-anaesthesia exposure
to impaired cognitive performance in both young and mature nervous systems. We
also provide a critical appraisal of the translational value of animal models and
highlight the important challenges that need to be addressed to strengthen the
link between laboratory work and clinical investigations in the field of
anaesthesia-neurotoxicity research.

Region-specific roles of the corticotropin-releasing factor-urocortin system in

Dysregulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-urocortin (UCN) system 
has been implicated in stress-related psychopathologies such as depression and
anxiety. It has been proposed that CRF-CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) signalling
promotes the stress response and anxiety-like behaviour, whereas UCNs and CRFR2
activation mediate stress recovery and the restoration of homeostasis. Recent
findings, however, provide clear evidence that this view is overly simplistic.
Instead, a more complex picture has emerged that suggests that there are brain
region- and cell type-specific effects of CRFR signalling that are influenced by 
the individual's prior experience and that shape molecular, cellular and
ultimately behavioural responses to stressful challenges.

Emerging roles of GluN3-containing NMDA receptors in the CNS.

GluN3-containing NMDA receptors (GluN3-NMDARs) are rarer than the 'classical'
NMDARs, which are composed solely of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, and have
non-conventional biophysical, trafficking and signalling properties. In the CNS, 
they seem to have important roles in delaying synapse maturation until the
arrival of sensory experience and in targeting non-used synapses for pruning. The
reactivation of GluN3A expression at inappropriate ages may underlie maladaptive 
synaptic rearrangements observed in addiction, neurodegenerative diseases and
other major brain disorders. Here, we discuss current evidence for these and
other emerging roles for GluN3-NMDARs in the physiology and pathology of the CNS.

As polarized cells, neurons maintain different sets of resident plasma membrane
proteins in their axons and dendrites, which is consistent with the different
roles that these neurites have in electrochemical signalling. Axonal and
dendritic proteins are synthesized together within the somatodendritic domain;
this raises a fundamental question: what is the nature of the intracellular
trafficking machinery that ensures that these proteins reach the correct domain? 
Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the processes underlying the
selective sorting and selective transport of axonal and dendritic proteins and
have created potential avenues for future progress.

Maltreatment-related childhood adversity is the leading preventable risk factor
for mental illness and substance abuse. Although the association between
maltreatment and psychopathology is compelling, there is a pressing need to
understand how maltreatment increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. Emerging
evidence suggests that maltreatment alters trajectories of brain development to
affect sensory systems, network architecture and circuits involved in threat
detection, emotional regulation and reward anticipation. This Review explores
whether these alterations reflect toxic effects of early-life stress or
potentially adaptive modifications, the relationship between psychopathology and 
brain changes, and the distinction between resilience, susceptibility and
compensation.

Members of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) class have emerged as 
crucial regulators of nervous system development, with important implications for
human health and disease. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of
aGPCR functions during key steps in neural development, including cortical
patterning, dendrite and synapse formation, and myelination. We focus on aGPCR
modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signalling to control
these varied aspects of neural development, and we discuss how impaired aGPCR
function leads to neurological disease. We further highlight the emerging
hypothesis that aGPCRs can be mechanically activated and the implications of this
property in the nervous system.

Mossy cells comprise a large fraction of the cells in the hippocampal dentate
gyrus, suggesting that their function in this region is important. They are
vulnerable to ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and seizures, and their loss
could contribute to dentate gyrus dysfunction in such conditions. Mossy cell
function has been unclear because these cells innervate both glutamatergic and
GABAergic neurons within the dentate gyrus, contributing to a complex circuitry. 
It has also been difficult to directly and selectively manipulate mossy cells to 
study their function. In light of the new data generated using methods to
preferentially eliminate or activate mossy cells in mice, it is timely to ask
whether mossy cells have become any less enigmatic than they were in the past.

The main characteristic of alcohol use disorder is the consumption of large
quantities of alcohol despite the negative consequences. The transition from the 
moderate use of alcohol to excessive, uncontrolled alcohol consumption results
from neuroadaptations that cause aberrant motivational learning and memory
processes. Here, we examine studies that have combined molecular and behavioural 
approaches in rodents to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that keep the social 
intake of alcohol in check, which we term 'stop pathways', and the
neuroadaptations that underlie the transition from moderate to uncontrolled,
excessive alcohol intake, which we term 'go pathways'. We also discuss
post-transcriptional, genetic and epigenetic alterations that underlie both types
of pathways.

In the embryonic and adult brain, neural stem cells proliferate and give rise to 
neurons and glia through highly regulated processes. Epigenetic mechanisms -
including DNA and histone modifications, as well as regulation by non-coding RNAs
- have pivotal roles in different stages of neurogenesis. Aberrant epigenetic
regulation also contributes to the pathogenesis of various brain disorders. Here,
we review recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic regulation in
neurogenesis and its dysregulation in brain disorders, including discussion of
newly identified DNA cytosine modifications. We also briefly cover the emerging
field of epitranscriptomics, which involves modifications of mRNAs and long
non-coding RNAs.

Research on the neural substrates of drug reward, withdrawal and relapse has yet 
to be translated into significant advances in the treatment of addiction. One
potential reason is that this research has not captured a common feature of human
addiction: progressive social exclusion and marginalization. We propose that
research aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms that link these processes
to drug seeking and drug taking would help to make addiction neuroscience
research more clinically relevant.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is activated in both acute and chronic pain. 
In this Review, we discuss increasing evidence from rodent studies that ACC
activation contributes to chronic pain states and describe several forms of
synaptic plasticity that may underlie this effect. In particular, one form of
long-term potentiation (LTP) in the ACC, which is triggered by the activation of 
NMDA receptors and expressed by an increase in AMPA-receptor function, sustains
the affective component of the pain state. Another form of LTP in the ACC, which 
is triggered by the activation of kainate receptors and expressed by an increase 
in glutamate release, may contribute to pain-related anxiety.

Data from clinical and preclinical studies indicate that immune dysregulation,
specifically of inflammatory processes, is associated with symptoms of major
depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, increased levels of circulating
pro-inflammatory cytokines and concomitant activation of brain-resident microglia
can lead to depressive behavioural symptoms. Repeated exposure to psychological
stress has a profound impact on peripheral immune responses and perturbs the
function of brain microglia, which may contribute to neurobiological changes
underlying MDD. Here, we review these findings and discuss ongoing studies
examining neuroimmune mechanisms that influence neuronal activity as well as
synaptic plasticity. Interventions targeting immune-related cellular and
molecular pathways may benefit subsets of MDD patients with immune dysregulation.

Dysregulation of the dopamine system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and

The dopamine system is unique among the brain's modulatory systems in that it has
discrete projections to specific brain regions involved in motor behaviour,
cognition and emotion. Dopamine neurons exhibit several activity patterns -
including tonic and phasic firing - that are determined by a combination of
endogenous pacemaker conductances and regulation by multiple afferent systems.
Emerging evidence suggests that disruptions in these regulatory systems may
underlie the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including
schizophrenia and depression.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that ensures the lysosomal
degradation of old, supernumerary or ectopic cytoplasmic entities. Most
eukaryotic cells, including neurons, rely on proficient autophagic responses for 
the maintenance of homeostasis in response to stress. Accordingly, autophagy
mediates neuroprotective effects following some forms of acute brain damage,
including methamphetamine intoxication, spinal cord injury and subarachnoid
haemorrhage. In some other circumstances, however, the autophagic machinery
precipitates a peculiar form of cell death (known as autosis) that contributes to
the aetiology of other types of acute brain damage, such as neonatal asphyxia.
Here, we dissect the context-specific impact of autophagy on non-infectious acute
brain injury, emphasizing the possible therapeutic application of pharmacological
activators and inhibitors of this catabolic process for neuroprotection.

The hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) both have important roles in
cognitive processes such as learning, memory and decision making. Nevertheless,
research on the OFC and hippocampus has proceeded largely independently, and
little consideration has been given to the importance of interactions between
these structures. Here, evidence is reviewed that the hippocampus and OFC encode 
parallel, but interactive, cognitive 'maps' that capture complex relationships
between cues, actions, outcomes and other features of the environment. A better
understanding of the interactions between the OFC and hippocampus is important
for understanding the neural bases of flexible, goal-directed decision making.

Somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons constitute a major class of inhibitory 
neurons in the mammalian cortex and are characterized by dense wiring into the
local network and high basal firing activity that persists in the absence of
synaptic input. This firing provides both GABA type A receptor (GABAAR)- and
GABABR-mediated inhibition that operates at fast and slow timescales. The
activity of somatostatin-expressing neurons is regulated by brain state, during
learning and in rewarded behaviour. Here, we review recent advances in our
understanding of how this class of cells can control network activity, with
specific reference to how this is constrained by their anatomical and
electrophysiological properties.

In this Opinion article, we discuss how integrated information theory accounts
for several aspects of the relationship between consciousness and the brain.
Integrated information theory starts from the essential properties of phenomenal 
experience, from which it derives the requirements for the physical substrate of 
consciousness. It argues that the physical substrate of consciousness must be a
maximum of intrinsic cause-effect power and provides a means to determine, in
principle, the quality and quantity of experience. The theory leads to some
counterintuitive predictions and can be used to develop new tools for assessing
consciousness in non-communicative patients.

Working memory - the ability to maintain and manipulate information over a period
of seconds - is a core component of higher cognitive functions. The storage
capacity of working memory is limited but can be expanded by training, and
evidence of the neural mechanisms underlying this effect is accumulating. Human
imaging studies and neurophysiological recordings in non-human primates, together
with computational modelling studies, reveal that training increases the activity
of prefrontal neurons and the strength of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex
and between the prefrontal and parietal cortex. Dopaminergic transmission could
have a facilitatory role. These changes more generally inform us of the
plasticity of higher cognitive functions.

The scarcity of live human brain cells for experimental access has for a long
time limited our ability to study complex human neurological disorders and
elucidate basic neuroscientific mechanisms. A decade ago, the development of
methods to reprogramme somatic human cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
enabled the in vitro generation of a wide range of neural cells from virtually
any human individual. The growth of methods to generate more robust and defined
neural cell types through reprogramming and direct conversion into induced
neurons has led to the establishment of various human reprogramming-based neural 
disease models.

of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.

Increasing evidence points to a complex interplay between genes and the
environment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including rare de novo mutations
in chromatin genes such as methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) in Rett syndrome.
Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation act at this interface, reflecting
the plasticity in metabolic and neurodevelopmentally regulated gene pathways.
Genome-wide studies of gene sequences, gene pathways and DNA methylation are
providing valuable mechanistic insights into ASD. The dynamic developmental
landscape of DNA methylation is vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental 
insults: therefore, understanding pathways that are central to this 'perfect
storm' will be crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.

Humans and non-human primates share an elemental quantification system that
resides in a dedicated neural network in the parietal and frontal lobes. In this 
cortical network, 'number neurons' encode the number of elements in a set, its
cardinality or numerosity, irrespective of stimulus appearance across sensory
motor systems, and from both spatial and temporal presentation arrays. After
numbers have been extracted from sensory input, they need to be processed to
support goal-directed behaviour. Studying number neurons provides insights into
how information is maintained in working memory and transformed in tasks that
require rule-based decisions. Beyond an understanding of how cardinal numbers are
encoded, number processing provides a window into the neuronal mechanisms of
high-level brain functions.

Although it is challenging for individuals with cocaine addiction to achieve
abstinence, the greatest difficulty is avoiding relapse to drug taking, which is 
often triggered by cues associated with prior cocaine use. This vulnerability to 
relapse persists for long periods (months to years) after abstinence is achieved.
Here, I discuss rodent studies of cue-induced cocaine craving during abstinence, 
with a focus on neuronal plasticity in the reward circuitry that maintains high
levels of craving. Such work has the potential to identify new therapeutic
targets and to further our understanding of experience-dependent plasticity in
the adult brain under normal circumstances and in the context of addiction.

A nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) within the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72
(C9orf72) gene was the first of this type of mutation to be linked to multiple
neurological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
frontotemporal dementia. The pathogenic mechanisms through which the C9orf72 NRE 
contributes to these disorders include loss of C9orf72 function and
gain-of-function mechanisms of C9orf72 driven by toxic RNA and protein species
encoded by the NRE. These mechanisms have been linked to several cellular defects
- including nucleocytoplasmic trafficking deficits and nuclear stress - that have
been observed in both patients and animal models.

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are assemblies of four core subunits, GluA1-4, that
mediate most fast excitatory neurotransmission. The component subunits determine 
the functional properties of AMPARs, and the prevailing view is that the subunit 
composition also determines AMPAR trafficking, which is dynamically regulated
during development, synaptic plasticity and in response to neuronal stress in
disease. Recently, the subunit dependence of AMPAR trafficking has been
questioned, leading to a reappraisal of this field. In this Review, we discuss
what is known, uncertain, conjectured and unknown about the roles of the
individual subunits, and how they affect AMPAR assembly, trafficking and function
under both normal and pathological conditions.

There have been a number of advances in the search for the neural correlates of
consciousness--the minimum neural mechanisms sufficient for any one specific
conscious percept. In this Review, we describe recent findings showing that the
anatomical neural correlates of consciousness are primarily localized to a
posterior cortical hot zone that includes sensory areas, rather than to a
fronto-parietal network involved in task monitoring and reporting. We also
discuss some candidate neurophysiological markers of consciousness that have
proved illusory, and measures of differentiation and integration of neural
activity that offer more promising quantitative indices of consciousness.

Alternative precursor-mRNA splicing is a key mechanism for regulating gene
expression in mammals and is controlled by specialized RNA-binding proteins. The 
misregulation of splicing is implicated in multiple neurological disorders. We
describe recent mouse genetic studies of alternative splicing that reveal its
critical role in both neuronal development and the function of mature neurons. We
discuss the challenges in understanding the extensive genetic programmes
controlled by proteins that regulate splicing, both during development and in the
adult brain.

Energy balance--that is, the relationship between energy intake and energy
expenditure--is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones, brain circuits and 
peripheral tissues. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine that suppresses
appetite and increases energy expenditure. Ironically, obese individuals have
high levels of plasma leptin and are resistant to leptin treatment. Neurotrophic 
factors, particularly ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are also important for the control of body weight.
CNTF can overcome leptin resistance in order to reduce body weight, although CNTF
and leptin activate similar signalling cascades. Mutations in the gene encoding
BDNF lead to insatiable appetite and severe obesity.

In an increasing number of states and countries, cannabis now stands poised to
join alcohol and tobacco as a legal drug. Quantifying the relative adverse and
beneficial effects of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids should therefore 
be prioritized. Whereas newspaper headlines have focused on links between
cannabis and psychosis, less attention has been paid to the much more common
problem of cannabis addiction. Certain cognitive changes have also been
attributed to cannabis use, although their causality and longevity are fiercely
debated. Identifying why some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the 
adverse effects of cannabis is now of paramount importance to public health.
Here, we review the current state of knowledge about such vulnerability factors, 
the variations in types of cannabis, and the relationship between these and
cognition and addiction.

Language-processing functions follow heterogeneous developmental trajectories.
The human embryo can already distinguish vowels in utero, but grammatical
complexity is usually not fully mastered until at least 7 years of age. Examining
the current literature, we propose that the ontogeny of the cortical language
network can be roughly subdivided into two main developmental stages. In the
first stage extending over the first 3 years of life, the infant rapidly acquires
bottom-up processing capacities, which are primarily implemented bilaterally in
the temporal cortices. In the second stage continuing into adolescence, top-down 
processes emerge gradually with the increasing functional selectivity and
structural connectivity of the left inferior frontal cortex.

There has been an explosion in the number of papers discussing the hypothesis of 
'pathogenic spread' in neurodegenerative disease - the idea that abnormal forms
of disease-associated proteins, such as tau or α-synuclein, physically move from 
neuron to neuron to induce disease progression. However, whether inter-neuronal
spread of protein aggregates actually occurs in humans and, if so, whether it
causes symptom onset remain uncertain. Even if pathogenic spread is proven in
humans, it is unclear how much this would alter the specific therapeutic
approaches that are in development. A critical appraisal of this increasingly
popular hypothesis thus seems both important and timely.

Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are a family of scaffold proteins 
that are highly enriched in synapses and are responsible for organizing the
numerous protein complexes required for synaptic development and plasticity.
Mutations in genes encoding MAGUKs and their interacting proteins can cause a
broad spectrum of human psychiatric disorders. Here, we review MAGUK-mediated
synaptic protein complex formation and regulation by focusing on findings from
recent biochemical and structural investigations. These mechanistic-based studies
show that the formation of MAGUK-organized complexes is often directly regulated 
by protein phosphorylation, suggesting a close connection between neuronal
activity and the assembly of dynamic protein complexes in synapses.

Rhythms of the hippocampal network.

Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.

The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) shows three major types of rhythms:
theta, sharp wave-ripples and gamma. These rhythms are defined by their
frequencies, they have behavioural correlates in several species including rats
and humans, and they have been proposed to carry out distinct functions in
hippocampal memory processing. However, recent findings have challenged
traditional views on these behavioural functions. In this Review, I discuss our
current understanding of the origins and the mnemonic functions of hippocampal
theta, sharp wave-ripples and gamma rhythms on the basis of findings from rodent 
studies. In addition, I present an updated synthesis of their roles and
interactions within the hippocampal network.

Unravelling the functional operation of neuronal networks and linking cellular
activity to specific behavioural outcomes are among the biggest challenges in
neuroscience. In this broad field of research, substantial progress has been made
in studies of the spinal networks that control locomotion. Through united efforts
using electrophysiological and molecular genetic network approaches and
behavioural studies in phylogenetically diverse experimental models, the
organization of locomotor networks has begun to be decoded. The emergent themes
from this research are that the locomotor networks have a modular organization
with distinct transmitter and molecular codes and that their organization is
reconfigured with changes to the speed of locomotion or changes in gait.

Genome-wide association studies have identified rare variants of the gene that
encodes triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) - an immune
receptor that is found in brain microglia - as risk factors for non-familial
Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, animal studies have indicated that microglia
have an important role in the brain response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and that
TREM2 variants may have an impact on such a function. We discuss how TREM2 may
control the microglial response to Aβ and its impact on microglial senescence, as
well as the interaction of TREM2 with other molecules that are encoded by gene
variants associated with AD and the hypothetical consequences of the cleavage of 
TREM2 from the cell surface.

Functional neural competence and integrity require interactive exchanges among
sensory and motor neurons, interneurons and glial cells. Recent studies have
attributed some of the tasks needed for these exchanges to extracellular vesicles
(such as exosomes and microvesicles), which are most prominently involved in
shuttling reciprocal signals between myelinating glia and neurons, thus promoting
neuronal survival, the immune response mediated by microglia, and synapse
assembly and plasticity. Such vesicles have also been identified as important
factors in the spread of neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer. These
extracellular vesicle functions add a previously unrecognized level of complexity
to transcellular interactions within the nervous system.

Vicarious trial and error.

When rats come to a decision point, they sometimes pause and look back and forth 
as if deliberating over the choice; at other times, they proceed as if they have 
already made their decision. In the 1930s, this pause-and-look behaviour was
termed 'vicarious trial and error' (VTE), with the implication that the rat was
'thinking about the future'. The discovery in 2007 that the firing of hippocampal
place cells gives rise to alternating representations of each of the potential
path options in a serial manner during VTE suggested a possible neural mechanism 
that could underlie the representations of future outcomes. More-recent
experiments examining VTE in rats suggest that there are direct parallels to
human processes of deliberative decision making, working memory and mental time
travel.

Anterior hippocampus: the anatomy of perception, imagination and episodic memory.

The brain creates a model of the world around us. We can use this representation 
to perceive and comprehend what we see at any given moment, but also to vividly
re-experience scenes from our past and imagine future (or even fanciful)
scenarios. Recent work has shown that these cognitive functions--perception,
imagination and recall of scenes and events--all engage the anterior hippocampus.
In this Opinion article, we capitalize on new findings from functional
neuroimaging to propose a model that links high-level cognitive functions to
specific structures within the anterior hippocampus.

Dopamine reward prediction-error signalling: a two-component response.

Author information:

Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK.

Environmental stimuli and objects, including rewards, are often processed
sequentially in the brain. Recent work suggests that the phasic dopamine reward
prediction-error response follows a similar sequential pattern. An initial brief,
unselective and highly sensitive increase in activity unspecifically detects a
wide range of environmental stimuli, then quickly evolves into the main response 
component, which reflects subjective reward value and utility. This temporal
evolution allows the dopamine reward prediction-error signal to optimally combine
speed and accuracy.

The 'one neuron, one neurotransmitter' doctrine states that synaptic
communication between two neurons occurs through the release of a single chemical
transmitter. However, recent findings suggest that neurons that communicate using
more than one classical neurotransmitter are prevalent throughout the adult
mammalian CNS. In particular, several populations of neurons previously thought
to release only glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine or histamine also release the 
major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Here, we review these findings and
discuss the implications of GABA co-release for synaptic transmission and
plasticity.

Should I stop or should I go? The role of complexin in neurotransmitter release.

Author information:

When it comes to fusion with the neuronal cell membrane, does a synaptic vesicle 
have a choice whether to stop or to go? Recent work suggests that complexin, a
tiny protein found within the synaptic terminal, contributes to the mechanism
through which this choice is made. How complexin plays this consulting part and
which synaptic vesicle proteins it interacts with remain open questions. Indeed, 
studies in mice and flies have led to the proposal of different models of
complexin function. We suggest that understanding the modular nature of complexin
will help us to unpick its role in synaptic vesicle release.

Autoantibodies targeting proteins at the neuromuscular junction are known to
cause several distinct myasthenic syndromes. Recently, autoantibodies targeting
neurotransmitter receptors and associated proteins have also emerged as a cause
of severe, but potentially treatable, diseases of the CNS. Here, we review the
clinical evidence as well as in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence that
autoantibodies account for myasthenic syndromes and autoimmune disorders of the
CNS by disrupting the functional or structural integrity of synapses. Studying
neurological and psychiatric diseases of autoimmune origin may provide new
insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying a broad range of CNS
disorders.

Hippocampal area CA2 has several features that distinguish it from CA1 and CA3,
including a unique gene expression profile, failure to display long-term
potentiation and relative resistance to cell death. A recent increase in interest
in the CA2 region, combined with the development of new methods to define and
manipulate its neurons, has led to some exciting new discoveries on the
properties of CA2 neurons and their role in behaviour. Here, we review these
findings and call attention to the idea that the definition of area CA2 ought to 
be revised in light of gene expression data.

For many types of learning, spaced training, which involves repeated long
inter-trial intervals, leads to more robust memory formation than does massed
training, which involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories have
been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently have data begun to
delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced training,
and we review these theories and data here. Computational models of the
implicated signalling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular
inter-trial intervals can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to
predict optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy,
suggests novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.

Molecular, genetic and pathological evidence suggests that deficits in GABAergic 
parvalbumin-positive interneurons contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology
through alterations in the brain's excitation-inhibition balance that result in
impaired behaviour and cognition. Although the factors that trigger these
deficits are diverse, there is increasing evidence that they converge on a common
pathological hub that involves NMDA receptor hypofunction and oxidative stress.
These factors have been separately linked to schizophrenia pathogenesis, but
evidence now suggests that they are mechanistically interdependent and contribute
to a common schizophrenia-associated pathology.

Self-grooming is a complex innate behaviour with an evolutionarily conserved
sequencing pattern and is one of the most frequently performed behavioural
activities in rodents. In this Review, we discuss the neurobiology of rodent
self-grooming, and we highlight studies of rodent models of neuropsychiatric
disorders--including models of autism spectrum disorder and obsessive compulsive 
disorder--that have assessed self-grooming phenotypes. We suggest that rodent
self-grooming may be a useful measure of repetitive behaviour in such models, and
therefore of value to translational psychiatry. Assessment of rodent
self-grooming may also be useful for understanding the neural circuits that are
involved in complex sequential patterns of action.

The puzzle of how complex nervous systems emerged remains unsolved. Comparative
studies of neurodevelopment in cnidarians and bilaterians suggest that this
process began with distinct integration centres that evolved on opposite ends of 
an initial nerve net. The 'apical nervous system' controlled general body
physiology, and the 'blastoporal nervous system' coordinated feeding movements
and locomotion. We propose that expansion, integration and fusion of these
centres gave rise to the bilaterian nerve cord and brain.

The molecular diversification of cell surface molecules has long been postulated 
to impart specific surface identities on neuronal cell types. The existence of
unique cell surface identities would allow neurons to distinguish one another and
connect with their appropriate target cells. Although progress has been made in
identifying cell type-specific surface molecule repertoires and in characterizing
their extracellular interactions, determining how this molecular diversity
contributes to the precise wiring of neural circuitry has proven challenging.
Here, we review the role of the cadherin, neurexin, immunoglobulin and
leucine-rich repeat protein superfamilies in the specification of connectivity.
The emerging evidence suggests that the concerted actions of these proteins may
critically contribute to the assembly of neural circuits.

Genome-editing tools, and in particular those based on CRISPR-Cas (clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated
protein) systems, are accelerating the pace of biological research and enabling
targeted genetic interrogation in almost any organism and cell type. These tools 
have opened the door to the development of new model systems for studying the
complexity of the nervous system, including animal models and stem cell-derived
in vitro models. Precise and efficient gene editing using CRISPR-Cas systems has 
the potential to advance both basic and translational neuroscience research.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that has a role in stabilizing neuronal
microtubules and thus in promoting axonal outgrowth. Structurally, tau is a
natively unfolded protein, is highly soluble and shows little tendency for
aggregation. However, tau aggregation is characteristic of several
neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. The mechanisms underlying tau
pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration are debated, but considerable
progress has been made in the field of tau research in recent years, including
the identification of new physiological roles for tau in the brain. Here, we
review the expression, post-translational modifications and functions of tau in
physiology and in pathophysiology.

The synapse is the focus of experimental research and theory on the cellular
mechanisms of nervous system plasticity and learning, but recent research is
expanding the consideration of plasticity into new mechanisms beyond the synapse,
notably including the possibility that conduction velocity could be modifiable
through changes in myelin to optimize the timing of information transmission
through neural circuits. This concept emerges from a confluence of brain imaging 
that reveals changes in white matter in the human brain during learning, together
with cellular studies showing that the process of myelination can be influenced
by action potential firing in axons. This Opinion article summarizes the new
research on activity-dependent myelination, explores the possible implications of
these studies and outlines the potential for new research.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a central integrator linking the 
perception of external and internal stimuli to distinct neurophysiological and
behavioural outcomes (such as fear reaction, anxiety and stress-coping), thus
allowing an organism to adapt to its changing environment. eCB signalling seems
to determine the value of fear-evoking stimuli and to tune appropriate
behavioural responses, which are essential for the organism's long-term
viability, homeostasis and stress resilience; and dysregulation of eCB signalling
can lead to psychiatric disorders. An understanding of the underlying neural cell
populations and cellular processes enables the development of therapeutic
strategies to mitigate behavioural maladaptation.

Contrast coding in the electrosensory system: parallels with visual computation.

To identify and interact with moving objects, including other members of the same
species, an animal's nervous system must correctly interpret patterns of contrast
in the physical signals (such as light or sound) that it receives from the
environment. In weakly electric fish, the motion of objects in the environment
and social interactions with other fish create complex patterns of contrast in
the electric fields that they produce and detect. These contrast patterns can
extend widely over space and time and represent a multitude of relevant features,
as is also true for other sensory systems. Mounting evidence suggests that the
computational principles underlying contrast coding in electrosensory neural
networks are conserved elements of spatiotemporal processing that show strong
parallels with the vertebrate visual system.

Classically, the basal ganglia have been considered to have a role in producing
habitual and goal-directed behaviours. In this article, we review recent evidence
that expands this role, indicating that the basal ganglia are also involved in
neural and behavioural inhibition in the motor and non-motor domains. We then
distinguish between goal-directed and habitual (also known as automatic)
inhibition mediated by fronto-striato-subthalamic-pallido-thalamo-cortical
networks. We also suggest that imbalance between goal-directed and habitual
action and inhibition contributes to some manifestations of Parkinson's disease, 
Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, we propose that
basal ganglia surgery improves these disorders by restoring a functional balance 
between facilitation and inhibition.

Cortical circuits work through the generation of coordinated, large-scale
activity patterns. In sensory systems, the onset of a discrete stimulus usually
evokes a temporally organized packet of population activity lasting ∼50-200 ms.
The structure of these packets is partially stereotypical, and variation in the
exact timing and number of spikes within a packet conveys information about the
identity of the stimulus. Similar packets also occur during ongoing stimuli and
spontaneously. We suggest that such packets constitute the basic building blocks 
of cortical coding.

Emotions are powerful determinants of behaviour, thought and experience, and they
may be regulated in various ways. Neuroimaging studies have implicated several
brain regions in emotion regulation, including the ventral anterior cingulate and
ventromedial prefrontal cortices, as well as the lateral prefrontal and parietal 
cortices. Drawing on computational approaches to value-based decision-making and 
reinforcement learning, we propose a unifying conceptual framework for
understanding the neural bases of diverse forms of emotion regulation.

DNA damage is correlated with and may drive the ageing process. Neurons in the
brain are postmitotic and are excluded from many forms of DNA repair; therefore, 
neurons are vulnerable to various neurodegenerative diseases. The challenges
facing the field are to understand how and when neuronal DNA damage accumulates, 
how this loss of genomic integrity might serve as a 'time keeper' of nerve cell
ageing and why this process manifests itself as different diseases in different
individuals.

Clinical studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
insulin resistance (IR) and cognitive dysfunction, but there are significant gaps
in our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Animal models of
IR help to bridge these gaps and point to hippocampal IR as a potential mediator 
of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM, as well as in Alzheimer disease (AD). This
Review highlights these observations and discusses intervention studies which
suggest that the restoration of insulin activity in the hippocampus may be an
effective strategy to alleviate the cognitive decline associated with T2DM and
AD.

Cable theory and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Huxley-Katz models for the propagation of
ions and voltage within a neuron have provided a theoretical foundation for
electrophysiology and been responsible for many cornerstone advances in
neuroscience. However, these theories break down when they are applied to small
neuronal compartments, such as dendritic spines, synaptic terminals or small
neuronal processes, because they assume spatial and ionic homogeneity. Here we
discuss a broader theory that uses the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) approximation 
and electrodiffusion to more accurately model the constraints that neuronal
nanostructures place on electrical current flow. This extension of traditional
cable theory could advance our understanding of the physiology of neuronal
nanocompartments.

Neural circuit function can be drastically affected by variations in the number
of cells that are produced during development or by a reduction in adult cell
number owing to disease. For this reason, unique cell cycle and cell growth
control mechanisms operate in the developing and adult brain. In Drosophila
melanogaster and in mammalian neural stem and progenitor cells, these mechanisms 
are intricately coordinated with the developmental age and the nutritional,
metabolic and hormonal state of the animal. Defects in neural stem cell
proliferation that result in the generation of incorrect cell numbers or defects 
in neural stem cell differentiation can cause microcephaly or megalencephaly.

Visual attention functions as a filter to select environmental information for
learning and memory, making it the first step in the eventual cascade of thought 
and action systems. Here, we review studies of typical and atypical visual
attention development and explain how they offer insights into the mechanisms of 
adult visual attention. We detail interactions between visual processing and
visual attention, as well as the contribution of visual attention to memory.
Finally, we discuss genetic mechanisms underlying attention disorders and how
attention may be modified by training.

Brain endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling influences the motivation for natural
rewards (such as palatable food, sexual activity and social interaction) and
modulates the rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Pathological forms of natural
and drug-induced reward are associated with dysregulated eCB signalling that may 
derive from pre-existing genetic factors or from prolonged drug exposure.
Impaired eCB signalling contributes to dysregulated synaptic plasticity,
increased stress responsivity, negative emotional states and cravings that propel
addiction. Understanding the contributions of eCB disruptions to behavioural and 
physiological traits provides insight into the eCB influence on addiction
vulnerability.

Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognition, which manifests
as difficulties in identifying emotions, feeing connected to others, inferring
people's thoughts and reacting emotionally to others. These social cognitive
impairments interfere with social connections and are strong determinants of the 
degree of impaired daily functioning in such individuals. Here, we review recent 
findings from the fields of social cognition and social neuroscience and identify
the social processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. We also consider empathy
as an example of a complex social cognitive function that integrates several
social processes and is impaired in schizophrenia. This information may guide
interventions to improve social cognition in patients with this disorder.

Tinnitus is the perception of phantom sound in the absence of a corresponding
external source. It is a highly prevalent disorder, and most cases are caused by 
cochlear injury that leads to peripheral deafferentation, which results in
adaptive changes in the CNS. In this article we critically assess the recent
neuroimaging studies in individuals with tinnitus that suggest that the disorder 
is accompanied by functional and structural brain abnormalities in distributed
auditory and non-auditory brain regions. Moreover, we consider how the
identification of the neuronal mechanisms underlying the different forms of
tinnitus would benefit from larger studies, replication and comprehensive
clinical assessment of patients.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most-frequently inherited form of intellectual
disability and the most-prevalent single-gene cause of autism, results from a
lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that 
acts, in most cases, to repress translation. Multiple pharmacological and genetic
manipulations that target receptors, scaffolding proteins, kinases and
translational control proteins can rescue neuronal morphology, synaptic function 
and behavioural phenotypes in FXS model mice, presumably by reducing excessive
neuronal translation to normal levels. Such rescue strategies might also be
explored in the future to identify the mRNAs that are critical for FXS
pathophysiology.

Genetics studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified several risk
genes that are key regulators of synaptic plasticity. Indeed, many of the risk
genes that have been linked to these disorders encode synaptic scaffolding
proteins, receptors, cell adhesion molecules or proteins that are involved in
chromatin remodelling, transcription, protein synthesis or degradation, or actin 
cytoskeleton dynamics. Changes in any of these proteins can increase or decrease 
synaptic strength or number and, ultimately, neuronal connectivity in the brain. 
In addition, when deleterious mutations occur, inefficient genetic buffering and 
impaired synaptic homeostasis may increase an individual's risk for ASD.

Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is associated with
persistent psychosocial disability in affected individuals. Although studies of
schizophrenia have traditionally focused on deficits in higher-order processes
such as working memory and executive function, there is an increasing realization
that, in this disorder, deficits can be found throughout the cortex and are
manifest even at the level of early sensory processing. These deficits are highly
amenable to translational investigation and represent potential novel targets for
clinical intervention. Deficits, moreover, have been linked to specific
structural abnormalities in post-mortem auditory cortex tissue from individuals
with schizophrenia, providing unique insights into underlying pathophysiological 
mechanisms.

Many attempts have been made to localize the physical trace of a memory, or
engram, in the brain. However, until recently, engrams have remained largely
elusive. In this Review, we develop four defining criteria that enable us to
critically assess the recent progress that has been made towards finding the
engram. Recent 'capture' studies use novel approaches to tag populations of
neurons that are active during memory encoding, thereby allowing these
engram-associated neurons to be manipulated at later times. We propose that
findings from these capture studies represent considerable progress in allowing
us to observe, erase and express the engram.

NaV1.9: a sodium channel linked to human pain.

The voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.9 is preferentially expressed in
nociceptors and has been shown in rodent models to have a major role in
inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These studies suggest that by selectively
targeting Na(V)1.9, it might be possible to ameliorate pain without inducing
adverse CNS side effects such as sedation, confusion and addictive potential.
Three recent studies in humans--two genetic and functional studies in rare
genetic disorders, and a third study showing a role for Na(V)1.9 in painful
peripheral neuropathy--have demonstrated that Na(V)1.9 plays an important part
both in regulating sensory neuron excitability and in pain signalling. With this 
human validation, attention is turning to this channel as a potential therapeutic
target for pain.

Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome
21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease.
It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the 
gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)--an Alzheimer disease risk
factor--although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may 
also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of
Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the
mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.

Increasing evidence points to a central role for immune dysregulation in autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Several ASD risk genes encode components of the immune
system and many maternal immune system-related risk factors--including
autoimmunity, infection and fetal reactive antibodies--are associated with ASD.
In addition, there is evidence of ongoing immune dysregulation in individuals
with ASD and in animal models of this disorder. Recently, several molecular
signalling pathways--including pathways downstream of cytokines, the receptor
MET, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, microglia and complement
factors--have been identified that link immune activation to ASD phenotypes.
Together, these findings indicate that the immune system is a point of
convergence for multiple ASD-related genetic and environmental risk factors.

Recent research into local-circuit GABAergic inhibitory interneurons of the
mammalian central nervous system has provided unprecedented insight into the
mechanics of neuronal circuitry and its dysfunction. Inhibitory interneurons
consist of a broad array of anatomically and neurochemically diverse cell types, 
and this suggests that each occupies an equally diverse functional role. Although
neurogliaform cells were observed by Cajal over a century ago, our understanding 
of the functional role of this class of interneurons is in its infancy. However, 
it is rapidly becoming clear that this cell type operates under a distinct
repertoire of rules to provide novel forms of inhibitory control of numerous
afferent pathways.

The choroid plexus (ChP) is the principal source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
which has accepted roles as a fluid cushion and a sink for nervous system waste
in vertebrates. Various animal models have provided insights into how the ChP-CSF
system develops and matures. In addition, recent studies have uncovered new,
active roles for this dynamic system in the regulation of neural stem cells,
critical periods and the overall health of the nervous system. Together, these
findings have brought about a paradigm shift in our understanding of brain
development and health, and have stimulated new initiatives for the treatment of 
neurological disease.

For over a century, the neuron doctrine--which states that the neuron is the
structural and functional unit of the nervous system--has provided a conceptual
foundation for neuroscience. This viewpoint reflects its origins in a time when
the use of single-neuron anatomical and physiological techniques was prominent.
However, newer multineuronal recording methods have revealed that ensembles of
neurons, rather than individual cells, can form physiological units and generate 
emergent functional properties and states. As a new paradigm for neuroscience,
neural network models have the potential to incorporate knowledge acquired with
single-neuron approaches to help us understand how emergent functional states
generate behaviour, cognition and mental disease.

Birth is associated with a neuroprotective, oxytocin-mediated abrupt
excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA shift that is abolished in autism, and its
restoration attenuates the disorder in offspring. In this Opinion article, I
discuss the links between birth-related stressful mechanisms, persistent
excitatory GABA actions, perturbed network oscillations and autism. I propose
that birth (parturition) is a critical period that confirms, attenuates or
aggravates the deleterious effects of intrauterine genetic or environmental
insults.

Placebo effects are beneficial effects that are attributable to the brain-mind
responses to the context in which a treatment is delivered rather than to the
specific actions of the drug. They are mediated by diverse processes--including
learning, expectations and social cognition--and can influence various clinical
and physiological outcomes related to health. Emerging neuroscience evidence
implicates multiple brain systems and neurochemical mediators, including opioids 
and dopamine. We present an empirical review of the brain systems that are
involved in placebo effects, focusing on placebo analgesia, and a conceptual
framework linking these findings to the mind-brain processes that mediate them.
This framework suggests that the neuropsychological processes that mediate
placebo effects may be crucial for a wide array of therapeutic approaches,
including many drugs.

Nociceptors and immune cells both protect the host from potential threats to
homeostasis. There is growing evidence for bidirectional signalling between these
two systems, and the underlying mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. An
understanding is emerging of how both the adaptive and innate immune systems can 
activate and sensitize nociceptors, and, reciprocally, how nociceptors modulate
immune cells. In this Review, we discuss how these interactions can be adaptive
and useful to the organism but also consider when such signalling might be
maladaptive and pathophysiological, contributing to immune-mediated diseases and 
persistent pain states.

Stress necessitates an immediate engagement of multiple neural and endocrine
systems. However, exposure to a single stressor causes adaptive changes that
modify responses to subsequent stressors. Recent studies examining synapses onto 
neuroendocrine cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
demonstrate that stressful experiences leave indelible marks that alter the
ability of these synapses to undergo plasticity. These adaptations include a
unique form of metaplasticity at glutamatergic synapses, bidirectional changes in
endocannabinoid signalling and bidirectional changes in strength at GABAergic
synapses that rely on distinct temporal windows following stress. This rich
repertoire of plasticity is likely to represent an important building block for
dynamic, experience-dependent modulation of neuroendocrine stress adaptation.

The brain regulates information flow by balancing the segregation and integration
of incoming stimuli to facilitate flexible cognition and behaviour. The
topological features of brain networks--in particular, network communities and
hubs--support this segregation and integration but do not provide information
about how external inputs are processed dynamically (that is, over time).
Experiments in which the consequences of selective inputs on brain activity are
controlled and traced with great precision could provide such information.
However, such strategies have thus far had limited success. By contrast, recent
whole-brain computational modelling approaches have enabled us to start assessing
the effect of input perturbations on brain dynamics in silico.

Intuition suggests that perception follows sensation and therefore bodily
feelings originate in the body. However, recent evidence goes against this logic:
interoceptive experience may largely reflect limbic predictions about the
expected state of the body that are constrained by ascending visceral sensations.
In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception
Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections
with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor
cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We
then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a
common vulnerability for mental and physical illness.

The past two decades of research into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) 
have been driven largely by the amyloid hypothesis; the neuroinflammation that is
associated with AD has been assumed to be merely a response to pathophysiological
events. However, new data from preclinical and clinical studies have established 
that immune system-mediated actions in fact contribute to and drive AD
pathogenesis. These insights have suggested both novel and well-defined potential
therapeutic targets for AD, including microglia and several cytokines. In
addition, as inflammation in AD primarily concerns the innate immune system -
unlike in 'typical' neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and
encephalitides - the concept of neuroinflammation in AD may need refinement.

Most neurodegenerative diseases that afflict humans are associated with the
intracytoplasmic deposition of aggregate-prone proteins in neurons and with
mitochondrial dysfunction. Autophagy is a powerful process for removing such
proteins and for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Over recent years,
evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that upregulation of autophagy may
protect against neurodegeneration. However, autophagy dysfunction has also been
implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. This Review summarizes the
progress that has been made in our understanding of how perturbations in
autophagy are linked with neurodegenerative diseases and the potential
therapeutic strategies resulting from the modulation of this process.

Decades of research has identified the brain areas that are involved in fear,
fear extinction, anxiety and related defensive behaviours. Newly developed
genetic and viral tools, optogenetics and advanced in vivo imaging techniques
have now made it possible to characterize the activity, connectivity and function
of specific cell types within complex neuronal circuits. Recent findings that
have been made using these tools and techniques have provided mechanistic
insights into the exquisite organization of the circuitry underlying internal
defensive states. This Review focuses on studies that have used circuit-based
approaches to gain a more detailed, and also more comprehensive and integrated,
view on how the brain governs fear and anxiety and how it orchestrates adaptive
defensive behaviours.

Neurodevelopmental programming - the implementation of the genetic and epigenetic
blueprints that guide and coordinate normal brain development - requires tight
regulation of transcriptional processes. During prenatal and postnatal time
periods, epigenetic processes fine-tune neurodevelopment towards an end product
that determines how an organism interacts with and responds to exposures and
experiences throughout life. Epigenetic processes also have the ability to
reprogramme the epigenome in response to environmental challenges, such as
maternal stress, making the organism more or less adaptive depending on the
future challenges presented. Epigenetic marks generated within germ cells as a
result of environmental influences throughout life can also shape future
generations long before conception occurs.

Stress often affects our social lives. When undergoing high-level or persistent
stress, individuals frequently retract from social interactions and become
irritable and hostile. Predisposition to antisocial behaviours - including social
detachment and violence - is also modulated by early life adversity; however, the
effects of early life stress depend on the timing of exposure and genetic
factors. Research in animals and humans has revealed some of the structural,
functional and molecular changes in the brain that underlie the effects of stress
on social behaviour. Findings in this emerging field will have implications both 
for the clinic and for society.

Endocannabinoids are lipid-derived messengers, and both their synthesis and
breakdown are under tight spatiotemporal regulation. As retrograde signalling
molecules, endocannabinoids are synthesized postsynaptically but activate
presynaptic cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors to inhibit neurotransmitter
release. In turn, CB1-expressing inhibitory and excitatory synapses act as
strategically placed control points for activity-dependent regulation of
dynamically changing normal and pathological oscillatory network activity. Here, 
we highlight emerging principles of cannabinoid circuit control and plasticity,
and discuss their relevance for epilepsy and related comorbidities. New insights 
into cannabinoid signalling may facilitate the translation of the recent interest
in cannabis-related substances as antiseizure medications to evidence-based
treatment strategies.

Astrocytes form borders (glia limitans) that separate neural from non-neural
tissue along perivascular spaces, meninges and tissue lesions in the CNS.
Transgenic loss-of-function studies reveal that astrocyte borders and scars serve
as functional barriers that restrict the entry of inflammatory cells into CNS
parenchyma in health and disease. Astrocytes also have powerful pro-inflammatory 
potential. Thus, astrocytes are emerging as pivotal regulators of CNS
inflammatory responses. This Review discusses evidence that astrocytes have
crucial roles in attracting and restricting CNS inflammation, with important
implications for diverse CNS disorders.

For several decades, addiction has come to be viewed as a disorder of the
dopamine neurotransmitter system; however, this view has not led to new
treatments. In this Opinion article, we review the origins of the dopamine theory
of addiction and discuss the ability of addictive drugs to elicit the release of 
dopamine in the human striatum. There is robust evidence that stimulants increase
striatal dopamine levels and some evidence that alcohol may have such an effect, 
but little evidence, if any, that cannabis and opiates increase dopamine levels. 
Moreover, there is good evidence that striatal dopamine receptor availability and
dopamine release are diminished in individuals with stimulant or alcohol
dependence but not in individuals with opiate, nicotine or cannabis dependence.
These observations have implications for understanding reward and treatment
responses in various addictions.

As the global population ages, older decision makers will be required to take
greater responsibility for their own physical, psychological and financial
well-being. With this in mind, researchers have begun to examine the effects of
ageing on decision making and associated neural circuits. A new
'affect-integration-motivation' (AIM) framework may help to clarify how affective
and motivational circuits support decision making. Recent research has shed light
on whether and how ageing influences these circuits, providing an
interdisciplinary account of how ageing can alter decision making.

Recent studies have revealed that patients with psychiatric disorders have
altered microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in the circulation and brain.
Furthermore, animal studies have shown that manipulating the levels of particular
miRNAs in the brain can alter behaviour. Here, we review recent studies in
humans, animal models, cellular systems and bioinformatics that have advanced our
understanding of the contribution of brain miRNAs to the regulation of behaviour 
in the context of psychiatric conditions. These studies highlight the potential
of miRNA levels to be used in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and suggest 
that brain miRNAs could become novel treatment targets for psychiatric disorders.

Coping with stress is fundamental for mental health, but understanding of the
molecular neurobiology of stress is still in its infancy. Adult neurogenesis is
well known to be regulated by stress, and conversely adult neurogenesis regulates
stress responses. Recent studies in neurogenic cells indicate that molecular
pathways activated by glucocorticoids, the main stress hormones, are modulated by
crosstalk with other stress-relevant mechanisms, including inflammatory
mediators, neurotrophic factors and morphogen signalling pathways. This Review
discusses the pathways that are involved in this crosstalk and thus regulate this
complex relationship between adult neurogenesis and stress.

Research over the past two decades broadly supports the claim that mindfulness
meditation - practiced widely for the reduction of stress and promotion of health
- exerts beneficial effects on physical and mental health, and cognitive
performance. Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to uncover the brain areas
and networks that mediate these positive effects. However, the underlying neural 
mechanisms remain unclear, and it is apparent that more methodologically rigorous
studies are required if we are to gain a full understanding of the neuronal and
molecular bases of the changes in the brain that accompany mindfulness
meditation.

The acquisition of literacy transforms the human brain. By reviewing studies of
illiterate subjects, we propose specific hypotheses on how the functions of core 
brain systems are partially reoriented or 'recycled' when learning to read.
Literacy acquisition improves early visual processing and reorganizes the ventral
occipito-temporal pathway: responses to written characters are increased in the
left occipito-temporal sulcus, whereas responses to faces shift towards the right
hemisphere. Literacy also modifies phonological coding and strengthens the
functional and anatomical link between phonemic and graphemic representations.
Literacy acquisition therefore provides a remarkable example of how the brain
reorganizes to accommodate a novel cultural skill.

Astrocytes seem to rely on relatively sluggish and spatially blurred Ca(2+) waves
to communicate with fast and point-precise neural circuits. This apparent
discrepancy could, however, reflect our current inability to understand the
microscopic mechanisms involved. Difficulties in detecting and interpreting
astrocyte Ca(2+) signals may have led to some prominent controversies in the
field. Here, we argue that a deeper understanding of astrocyte physiology
requires a qualitative leap in our experimental and analytical strategies.

Exposure to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, leads to plastic changes in the
activity of brain circuits, and a prevailing view is that these changes play a
part in drug addiction. Notably, there has been intense focus on drug-induced
changes in synaptic excitability and much less attention on intrinsic
excitability factors (that is, excitability factors that are remote from the
synapse). Accumulating evidence now suggests that intrinsic factors such as K+
channels are not only altered by cocaine but may also contribute to the shaping
of the addiction phenotype.

Pathological perturbations of the brain are rarely confined to a single locus;
instead, they often spread via axonal pathways to influence other regions.
Patterns of such disease propagation are constrained by the extraordinarily
complex, yet highly organized, topology of the underlying neural architecture;
the so-called connectome. Thus, network organization fundamentally influences
brain disease, and a connectomic approach grounded in network science is integral
to understanding neuropathology. Here, we consider how brain-network topology
shapes neural responses to damage, highlighting key maladaptive processes (such
as diaschisis, transneuronal degeneration and dedifferentiation), and the
resources (including degeneracy and reserve) and processes (such as compensation)
that enable adaptation. We then show how knowledge of network topology allows us 
not only to describe pathological processes but also to generate predictive
models of the spread and functional consequences of brain disease.

Multiple sclerosis is characterized at the gross pathological level by the
presence of widespread focal demyelinating lesions of the myelin-rich white
matter. However, it is becoming clear that grey matter is not spared, even during
the earliest phases of the disease. Furthermore, grey matter damage may have an
important role both in physical and cognitive disability. Grey matter pathology
involves both inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, but the relationship
between the two is unclear. Histological, immunological and neuroimaging studies 
have provided new insight in this rapidly expanding field, and form the basis of 
the most recent hypotheses on the pathogenesis of grey matter damage.

Subplate neurons have an essential role in cortical circuit formation. They are
among the earliest formed neurons of the cerebral cortex, are located at the
junction of white and grey matter, and are necessary for correct thalamocortical 
axon ingrowth. Recent transcriptomic studies have provided opportunities for
monitoring and modulating selected subpopulations of these cells. Analyses of
mouse lines expressing reporter genes have demonstrated novel, extracortical
subplate neurogenesis and have shown how subplate cells are integrated under the 
influence of sensory activity into cortical and extracortical circuits. Recent
studies have revealed that the subplate is involved in neurosecretion and
modification of the extracellular milieu.

Retromer is a protein assembly that has a central role in endosomal trafficking, 
and retromer dysfunction has been linked to a growing number of neurological
disorders. First linked to Alzheimer disease, retromer dysfunction causes a range
of pathophysiological consequences that have been shown to contribute to the core
pathological features of the disease. Genetic studies have established that
retromer dysfunction is also pathogenically linked to Parkinson disease, although
the biological mechanisms that mediate this link are only now being elucidated.
Most recently, studies have shown that retromer is a tractable target in drug
discovery for these and other disorders of the nervous system.

Spatial orientation and navigation rely on the acquisition of several types of
sensory information. This information is then transformed into a neural code for 
space in the hippocampal formation through the activity of place cells, grid
cells and head-direction cells. These spatial representations, in turn, are
thought to guide long-range navigation. But how the representations encoded by
these different cell types are integrated in the brain to form a neural 'map and 
compass' is largely unknown. Here, we discuss this problem in the context of
spatial navigation by bats and rats. We review the experimental findings and
theoretical models that provide insight into the mechanisms that link sensory
systems to spatial representations and to large-scale natural navigation.

The adult mammalian cerebellar cortex is generally assumed to have a uniform
cytoarchitecture. Differences in cerebellar function are thought to arise
primarily through distinct patterns of input and output connectivity rather than 
as a result of variations in cortical microcircuitry. However, evidence from
anatomical, physiological and genetic studies is increasingly challenging this
orthodoxy, and there are now various lines of evidence indicating that the
cerebellar cortex is not uniform. Here, we develop the hypothesis that regional
differences in properties of cerebellar cortical microcircuits lead to important 
differences in information processing.

The progression of many neurodegenerative diseases is thought to be driven by the
template-directed misfolding, seeded aggregation and cell-cell transmission of
characteristic disease-related proteins, leading to the sequential dissemination 
of pathological protein aggregates. Recent evidence strongly suggests that the
anatomical connections made by neurons - in addition to the intrinsic
characteristics of neurons, such as morphology and gene expression profile -
determine whether they are vulnerable to degeneration in these disorders.
Notably, this common pathogenic principle opens up opportunities for pursuing
novel targets for therapeutic interventions for these neurodegenerative
disorders. We review recent evidence that supports the notion of neuron-neuron
protein propagation, with a focus on neuropathological and positron emission
tomography imaging studies in humans.

Chemokines and opioids are important regulators of immune, inflammatory and
neuronal responses in peripheral and central pain pathways. Recent studies have
provided insights into the functional interactions between chemokine receptors
and opioid receptors, and their role in pain modulation. In this Progress
article, we discuss how crosstalk between these two systems might provide a
molecular and cellular framework for the development of novel analgesic therapies
for the management of acute and/or chronic pain.

Ageing is characterized by the progressive impairment of physiological functions 
and increased risk of developing debilitating disorders, including chronic
inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. These disorders have common
molecular mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. In the wake of the
approval of the first cannabinoid-based drug for the symptomatic treatment of
multiple sclerosis, we examine how endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling controls--and
is affected by--normal ageing and neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative
disorders. We propose a conceptual framework linking eCB signalling to the
control of the cellular and molecular hallmarks of these processes, and
categorize the key components of endocannabinoid signalling that may serve as
targets for novel therapeutics.

The mechanisms and functions of spontaneous neurotransmitter release.

Author information:

Fast synaptic communication in the brain requires synchronous vesicle fusion that
is evoked by action potential-induced Ca(2+) influx. However, synaptic terminals 
also release neurotransmitters by spontaneous vesicle fusion, which is
independent of presynaptic action potentials. A functional role for spontaneous
neurotransmitter release events in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and
homeostasis, as well as the regulation of certain behaviours, has been reported. 
In addition, there is evidence that the presynaptic mechanisms underlying
spontaneous release of neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic targets are
segregated from those of evoked neurotransmission. These findings challenge
current assumptions about neuronal signalling and neurotransmission, as they
indicate that spontaneous neurotransmission has an autonomous role in
interneuronal communication that is distinct from that of evoked release.

Hormones regulate homeostasis by communicating through the bloodstream to the
body's organs, including the brain. As homeostatic regulators of brain function, 
some hormones exert neuroprotective actions. This is the case for the ovarian
hormone 17β-oestradiol, which signals through oestrogen receptors (ERs) that are 
widely distributed in the male and female brain. Recent discoveries have shown
that oestradiol is not only a reproductive hormone but also a brain-derived
neuroprotective factor in males and females and that ERs coordinate multiple
signalling mechanisms that protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases,
affective disorders and cognitive decline.

The brain is constantly bombarded by stimuli, and the relative salience of these 
inputs determines which are more likely to capture attention. A brain system
known as the 'salience network', with key nodes in the insular cortices, has a
central role in the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli and the
coordination of neural resources. Emerging evidence suggests that atypical
engagement of specific subdivisions of the insula within the salience network is 
a feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders.

Recent years have seen the publication of a range of new theories suggesting that
the basis of dyslexia might be sensory dysfunction. In this Opinion article, the 
evidence for and against several prominent sensory theories of dyslexia is
closely scrutinized. Contrary to the causal claims being made, my analysis
suggests that many proposed sensory deficits might result from the effects of
reduced reading experience on the dyslexic brain. I therefore suggest that
longitudinal studies of sensory processing, beginning in infancy, are required to
successfully identify the neural basis of developmental dyslexia. Such studies
could have a powerful impact on remediation.

Among the many signalling lipids, endocannabinoids are increasingly recognized
for their important roles in neuronal and glial development. Recent experimental 
evidence suggests that, during neuronal differentiation, endocannabinoid
signalling undergoes a fundamental switch from the prenatal determination of cell
fate to the homeostatic regulation of synaptic neurotransmission and
bioenergetics in the mature nervous system. These studies also offer novel

The brain is highly enriched with fatty acids. These include the polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PUFAs) arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which are largely 
esterified to the phospholipid cell membrane. Once PUFAs are released from the
membrane, they can participate in signal transduction, either directly or after
enzymatic conversion to a variety of bioactive derivatives ('mediators'). PUFAs
and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as
neurotransmission, cell survival and neuroinflammation, and thereby mood and
cognition. PUFA levels and the signalling pathways that they regulate are altered
in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major
depression. Diet and drugs targeting PUFAs may lead to novel therapeutic
approaches for the prevention and treatment of brain disorders.

Ever since Stone Age men discovered that knapping flint produced sharp stone
edges that could be used in combat as well as for cooking and hunting,
technological advances of all kinds have been adapted and adopted by the
military.The opportunities provided by modern neuroscience are proving no
exception, but their application in a military context is accompanied by complex 
practical and ethical considerations.

The molecular bases of the suicidal brain.

Author information:

Suicide ranks among the leading causes of death around the world and takes a
heavy emotional and public health toll on most societies. Both distal and
proximal factors contribute to suicidal behaviour. Distal factors - such as
familial and genetic predisposition, as well as early-life adversity - increase
the lifetime risk of suicide. They alter responses to stress and other processes 
through epigenetic modification of genes and associated changes in gene
expression, and through the regulation of emotional and behavioural traits.
Proximal factors are associated with the precipitation of a suicidal event and
include alterations in key neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory changes and
glial dysfunction in the brain. This Review explores the key molecular changes
that are associated with suicidality and discusses some promising avenues for
future research.

Neuroscience and education: myths and messages.

Howard-Jones PA(1).

For several decades, myths about the brain - neuromyths - have persisted in
schools and colleges, often being used to justify ineffective approaches to
teaching. Many of these myths are biased distortions of scientific fact. Cultural
conditions, such as differences in terminology and language, have contributed to 
a 'gap' between neuroscience and education that has shielded these distortions
from scrutiny. In recent years, scientific communications across this gap have
increased, although the messages are often distorted by the same conditions and
biases as those responsible for neuromyths. In the future, the establishment of a
new field of inquiry that is dedicated to bridging neuroscience and education may
help to inform and to improve these communications.

Neuromuscular synaptogenesis: coordinating partners with multiple functions.

Darabid H, Perez-Gonzalez AP, Robitaille R.

The formation of highly efficient and reliable synapses at the neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) relies on dynamic molecular interactions. Studies of the
development and maturation of the NMJ have focused on events that are dependent
on synaptic activity and that require the coordinated actions of nerve- and
muscle-derived molecules with different targets and effects. More recently,
perisynaptic Schwann cells--the glial cells at NMJs--have become an important
focus of research. These glia concomitantly contribute to pre- and postsynaptic
maturation while undergoing maturation themselves. Thus, an intricate 'danse à
trois’'regulates the maturation of the NMJ to form a highly efficient
communication unit, in which fine glial processes lie in close proximity to a
highly concentrated population of postsynaptic receptors and perfectly aligned
presynaptic release sites.

Isolation and structure elucidation of most of the major cannabinoid
constituents--including Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), which is the
principal psychoactive molecule in Cannabis sativa--was achieved in the 1960s and
1970s. It was followed by the identification of two cannabinoid receptors in the 
1980s and the early 1990s and by the identification of the endocannabinoids
shortly thereafter. There have since been considerable advances in our
understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its function in the brain, which 
reveal potential therapeutic targets for a wide range of brain disorders.

Sensory signals are highly structured in both space and time. These structural
regularities in visual information allow expectations to form about future
stimulation, thereby facilitating decisions about visual features and objects.
Here, we discuss how expectation modulates neural signals and behaviour in humans
and other primates. We consider how expectations bias visual activity before a
stimulus occurs, and how neural signals elicited by expected and unexpected
stimuli differ. We discuss how expectations may influence decision signals at the
computational level. Finally, we consider the relationship between visual
expectation and related concepts, such as attention and adaptation.

The role of orexin in motivated behaviours.

Medicine, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8640,

Wakefulness and vigilance levels are required for maintaining purposeful
activities and motivated behaviours, which are often triggered by sensory
information conveying external cues. An increasing body of work has suggested
that orexins (also known as hypocretins)--a pair of neuropeptides that are
crucial for maintaining wakefulness - are also involved in the regulation of
motivated behaviours, including feeding, emotional behaviour and reward seeking, 
and that these functions are mediated by two subtypes of orexin receptors.
Autonomic and endocrine responses, which accompany these motivated behaviours,
are also influenced by the orexin system. Orexin-producing neurons act as a hub
that links information about the internal and external environments of an animal 
to vigilance levels and internal bodily functions to support various motivated
behaviours.

Time cells in the hippocampus: a new dimension for mapping memories.

Eichenbaum H(1).

Author information: 
(1)Center for Memory and Brain, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215,
USA.

Recent studies have revealed the existence of hippocampal neurons that fire at
successive moments in temporally structured experiences. Several studies have
shown that such temporal coding is not attributable to external events, specific 
behaviours or spatial dimensions of an experience. Instead, these cells represent
the flow of time in specific memories and have therefore been dubbed 'time
cells'. The firing properties of time cells parallel those of hippocampal place
cells; time cells thus provide an additional dimension that is integrated with
spatial mapping. The robust representation of both time and space in the
hippocampus suggests a fundamental mechanism for organizing the elements of
experience into coherent memories.

The precise functional role of the hippocampus remains a topic of much debate.
The dominant view is that the dorsal (or posterior) hippocampus is implicated in 
memory and spatial navigation and the ventral (or anterior) hippocampus mediates 
anxiety-related behaviours. However, this 'dichotomy view' may need revision.
Gene expression studies demonstrate multiple functional domains along the
hippocampal long axis, which often exhibit sharply demarcated borders. By
contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents
suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these
observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are
superimposed on discrete functional domains. This model provides a potential
framework to explain and test the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus.

Electrical activity in neurons requires a seamless functional coupling between
plasmalemmal ion channels and ion transporters. Although ion channels have been
studied intensively for several decades, research on ion transporters is in its
infancy. In recent years, it has become evident that one family of ion
transporters, cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), and in particular K(+)-Cl(-)
cotransporter 2 (KCC2), have seminal roles in shaping GABAergic signalling and
neuronal connectivity. Studying the functions of these transporters may lead to
major paradigm shifts in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain
development and plasticity in health and disease.

Modern network science has revealed fundamental aspects of normal brain-network
organization, such as small-world and scale-free patterns, hierarchical
modularity, hubs and rich clubs. The next challenge is to use this knowledge to
gain a better understanding of brain disease. Recent developments in the
application of network science to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease,
multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy have challenged the
classical concept of neurological disorders being either 'local' or 'global', and
have pointed to the overload and failure of hubs as a possible final common
pathway in neurological disorders.

Despite global increases in diversity, social prejudices continue to fuel
intergroup conflict, disparities and discrimination. Moreover, as norms have
become more egalitarian, prejudices seem to have 'gone underground', operating
covertly and often unconsciously, such that they are difficult to detect and
control. Neuroscientists have recently begun to probe the neural basis of
prejudice and stereotyping in an effort to identify the processes through which
these biases form, influence behaviour and are regulated. This research aims to
elucidate basic mechanisms of the social brain while advancing our understanding 
of intergroup bias in social behaviour.

Neuronal circuits are defined by synaptic connections between their cellular
constituents. In this article, I highlight several recent studies emphasizing the
surprising level of precision exhibited by inhibitory GABAergic synapses within
the neocortex and hippocampus. Specifically, GABAergic inputs to dendritic shafts
and spines of pyramidal cells have a key role in the localized regulation of
neuronal Ca(2+) signalling. These findings provide important new insights into
the cellular mechanisms underlying the contributions of inhibitory transmission
to both normal and abnormal brain activity.

Understanding how the brain controls behaviour is undisputedly one of the grand
goals of neuroscience research, and the pursuit of this goal has a long tradition
in insect neuroscience. However, appropriate techniques were lacking for a long
time. Recent advances in genetic and recording techniques now allow the
participation of identified neurons in the execution of specific behaviours to be
interrogated. By focusing on fly visual course control, I highlight what has been
learned about the neuronal circuit modules that control visual guidance in
Drosophila melanogaster through the use of these techniques.

Intrinsically different retinal progenitor cells produce specific types of
progeny.

Lineage studies conducted in the retina more than 25 years ago demonstrated the
multipotency of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). The number and types of cells
produced by individual RPCs, even from a single time point in development, were
found to be highly variable. This raised the question of whether this variability
was due to intrinsic differences among RPCs or to extrinsic and/or stochastic
effects on equivalent RPCs or their progeny. Newer lineage studies that have made
use of molecular markers of RPCs, retrovirus-mediated lineage analyses of
specific RPCs and live imaging have begun to provide answers to this question.
RPCs that produce two postmitotic daughter cells - that is, terminally dividing
RPCs - have been the most well characterized RPCs to date, and have been shown to
produce specific types of daughter cells. In addition, recent studies have begun 
to shed light on the mechanisms that drive the temporal order in which retinal
cells are born.

Integrating the active process of hair cells with cochlear function.

Author information:

Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, New York 10065, USA.

Uniquely among human senses, hearing is not simply a passive response to
stimulation. Our auditory system is instead enhanced by an active process in
cochlear hair cells that amplifies acoustic signals several hundred-fold,
sharpens frequency selectivity and broadens the ear's dynamic range. Active
motility of the mechanoreceptive hair bundles underlies the active process in
amphibians and some reptiles; in mammals, this mechanism operates in conjunction 
with prestin-based somatic motility. Both individual hair bundles and the cochlea
as a whole operate near a dynamical instability, the Hopf bifurcation, which
accounts for the cardinal features of the active process.

Our ability to perceive temperature is crucial: it enables us to swiftly react to
noxiously cold or hot objects and helps us to maintain a constant body
temperature. Sensory nerve endings, upon depolarization by temperature-gated ion 
channels, convey electrical signals from the periphery to the CNS, eliciting a
sense of temperature. In the past two decades, we have witnessed important
advances in our understanding of mammalian thermosensation, with the
identification and animal-model assessment of candidate molecular thermosensors -
such as types of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels - involved in
peripheral thermosensation. Ongoing research aims to understand how these
miniature thermometers operate at the cellular and molecular level, and how they 
can be pharmacologically targeted to treat pain without disturbing vital
thermoregulatory processes.

Development of multisensory integration from the perspective of the individual
neuron.

Stein BE, Stanford TR, Rowland BA.

The ability to use cues from multiple senses in concert is a fundamental aspect
of brain function. It maximizes the brain’s use of the information available to
it at any given moment and enhances the physiological salience of external
events. Because each sense conveys a unique perspective of the external world,
synthesizing information across senses affords computational benefits that cannot
otherwise be achieved. Multisensory integration not only has substantial survival
value but can also create unique experiences that emerge when signals from
different sensory channels are bound together. However, neurons in a newborn’s
brain are not capable of multisensory integration, and studies in the midbrain
have shown that the development of this process is not predetermined. Rather, its
emergence and maturation critically depend on cross-modal experiences that alter 
the underlying neural circuit in such a way that optimizes multisensory
integrative capabilities for the environment in which the animal will function.

Retinal bipolar cells: elementary building blocks of vision.

Euler T, Haverkamp S, Schubert T, Baden T.

Retinal bipolar cells are the first ‘projection neurons’ of the vertebrate visual
system—all of the information needed for vision is relayed by this intraretinal
connection. Each of the at least 13 distinct types of bipolar cells
systematically transforms the photoreceptor input in a different way, thereby
generating specific channels that encode stimulus properties, such as polarity,
contrast, temporal profile and chromatic composition. As a result, bipolar cell
output signals represent elementary ‘building blocks’ from which the
microcircuits of the inner retina derive a feature-oriented description of the
visual world.

Mobile elements are DNA sequences that can change their position (retrotranspose)
within the genome. Although its biological function is largely unappreciated, DNA
derived from mobile elements comprises nearly half of the human genome. It has
long been thought that neuronal genomes are invariable; however, recent studies
have demonstrated that mobile elements actively retrotranspose during
neurogenesis, thereby creating genomic diversity between neurons. In addition,
mounting data demonstrate that mobile elements are misregulated in certain
neurological disorders, including Rett syndrome and schizophrenia.

The neurobiology of rewards and values in social decision making.

How does our brain choose the best course of action? Choices between material
goods are thought to be steered by neural value signals that encode the rewarding
properties of the choice options. Social decisions, by contrast, are
traditionally thought to rely on neural representations of the self and others.
However, recent studies show that many types of social decisions may also involve
neural value computations. This suggests a unified mechanism for motivational
control of behaviour that may incorporate both social and non-social factors. In 
this Review, we outline a theoretical framework that may help to identify
possible overlaps and differences between the neural processes that guide social 
and non-social decision making.

The functional architecture of the ventral temporal cortex and its role in

Visual categorization is thought to occur in the human ventral temporal cortex
(VTC), but how this categorization is achieved is still largely unknown. In this 
Review, we consider the computations and representations that are necessary for
categorization and examine how the microanatomical and macroanatomical layout of 
the VTC might optimize them to achieve rapid and flexible visual categorization. 
We propose that efficient categorization is achieved by organizing
representations in a nested spatial hierarchy in the VTC. This spatial hierarchy 
serves as a neural infrastructure for the representational hierarchy of visual
information in the VTC and thereby enables flexible access to category
information at several levels of abstraction.

People are increasingly being exposed to environmental noise from traffic, media 
and other sources that falls within and outside legal limits. Although such
environmental noise is known to cause stress in the auditory system, it is still 
generally considered to be harmless. This complacency may be misplaced: even in
the absence of cochlear damage, new findings suggest that environmental noise may
progressively degrade hearing through alterations in the way sound is represented
in the adult auditory cortex.

Malignant gliomas are devastating tumours that frequently kill patients within 1 
year of diagnosis. The major obstacle to a cure is diffuse invasion, which
enables tumours to escape complete surgical resection and chemo- and radiation
therapy. Gliomas use the same tortuous extracellular routes of migration that are
travelled by immature neurons and stem cells, frequently using blood vessels as
guides. They repurpose ion channels to dynamically adjust their cell volume to
accommodate to narrow spaces and breach the blood-brain barrier through
disruption of astrocytic endfeet, which envelop blood vessels. The unique biology
of glioma invasion provides hitherto unexplored brain-specific therapeutic
targets for this devastating disease.

Light has profoundly influenced the evolution of life on earth. As widely
appreciated, light enables us to generate images of our environment. However,
light - through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) -
also influences behaviours that are essential for our health and quality of life 
but are independent of image formation. These include the synchronization of the 
circadian clock to the solar day, tracking of seasonal changes and the regulation
of sleep. Irregular light environments lead to problems in circadian rhythms and 
sleep, which eventually cause mood and learning deficits. Recently, it was found 
that irregular light can also directly affect mood and learning without producing
major disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep. In this Review, we discuss the 
indirect and direct influence of light on mood and learning, and provide a model 
for how light, the circadian clock and sleep interact to influence mood and
cognitive functions.

One of the grand challenges in neuroscience is to comprehend neural computation
in the association cortices, the parts of the cortex that have shown the largest 
expansion and differentiation during mammalian evolution and that are thought to 
contribute profoundly to the emergence of advanced cognition in humans. In this
Review, we use grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex as a gateway to
understand network computation at a stage of cortical processing in which firing 
patterns are shaped not primarily by incoming sensory signals but to a large
extent by the intrinsic properties of the local circuit.

Müller glial cell reprogramming and retina regeneration.

Goldman D(1).

Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.

Müller glia are the major glial component of the retina. They are one of the last
retinal cell types to be born during development, and they function to maintain
retinal homeostasis and integrity. In mammals, Müller glia respond to retinal
injury in various ways that can be either protective or detrimental to retinal
function. Although these cells can be coaxed to proliferate and generate neurons 
under special circumstances, these responses are meagre and insufficient for
repairing a damaged retina. By contrast, in teleost fish (such as zebrafish), the
response of Müller glia to retinal injury involves a reprogramming event that
imparts retinal stem cell characteristics and enables them to produce a
proliferating population of progenitors that can regenerate all major retinal
cell types and restore vision. Recent studies have revealed several important
mechanisms underlying Müller glial cell reprogramming and retina regeneration in 
fish that may lead to new strategies for stimulating retina regeneration in
mammals.

Punctuated episodes of spreading depolarizations erupt in the brain, encumbering 
tissue structure and function, and raising fascinating unanswered questions
concerning their initiation and propagation. Linked to migraine aura and
headache, cortical spreading depression contributes to the morbidity in the
world's migraine with aura population. Even more ominously, erupting spreading
depolarizations accelerate tissue damage during brain injury. The once-held view 
that spreading depolarizations may not exist in the human brain has changed,
largely because of the discovery of migraine genes that confer cortical spreading
depression susceptibility, the application of sophisticated imaging tools and
efforts to interrogate their impact in the acutely injured human brain.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive thoughts and
behaviours that are experienced as unwanted. Family and twin studies have
demonstrated that OCD is a multifactorial familial condition that involves both
polygenic and environmental risk factors. Neuroimaging studies have implicated
the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit in the pathophysiology of the
disorder, which is supported by the observation of specific neuropsychological
impairments in patients with OCD, mainly in executive functions. Genetic studies 
indicate that genes affecting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic
systems, and the interaction between them, play a crucial part in the functioning
of this circuit. Environmental factors such as adverse perinatal events,
psychological trauma and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk
genes and, hence, trigger the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.

Axon degeneration is a prominent early feature of most neurodegenerative
disorders and can also be induced directly by nerve injury in a process known as 
Wallerian degeneration. The discovery of genetic mutations that delay Wallerian
degeneration has provided insight into mechanisms underlying axon degeneration in
disease. Rapid Wallerian degeneration requires the pro-degenerative molecules
SARM1 and PHR1. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is
essential for axon growth and survival. Its loss from injured axons may activate 
Wallerian degeneration, whereas NMNAT overexpression rescues axons from
degeneration. Here, we discuss the roles of these and other proposed regulators
of Wallerian degeneration, new opportunities for understanding disease mechanisms
and intriguing links between Wallerian degeneration, innate immunity, synaptic
growth and cell death.

Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease.

Under normal conditions, food intake and energy expenditure are balanced by a
homeostatic system that maintains stability of body fat content over time.
However, this homeostatic system can be overridden by the activation of
'emergency response circuits' that mediate feeding responses to emergent or
stressful stimuli. Inhibition of these circuits is therefore permissive for
normal energy homeostasis to occur, and their chronic activation can cause
profound, even life-threatening, changes in body fat mass. This Review highlights
how the interplay between homeostatic and emergency feeding circuits influences
the biologically defended level of body weight under physiological and
pathophysiological conditions.

We might be forced to listen to a high-frequency tone at our audiologist's office
or we might enjoy falling asleep with a white-noise machine, but the sounds that 
really matter to us are the voices of our companions or music from our favourite 
radio station. The auditory system has evolved to process behaviourally relevant 
natural sounds. Research has shown not only that our brain is optimized for
natural hearing tasks but also that using natural sounds to probe the auditory
system is the best way to understand the neural computations that enable us to
comprehend speech or appreciate music.

The ability to speak two languages often marvels monolinguals, although
bilinguals report no difficulties in achieving this feat. Here, we examine how
learning and using two languages affect language acquisition and processing as
well as various aspects of cognition. We do so by addressing three main
questions. First, how do infants who are exposed to two languages acquire them
without apparent difficulty? Second, how does language processing differ between 
monolingual and bilingual adults? Last, what are the collateral effects of
bilingualism on the executive control system across the lifespan? Research in all
three areas has not only provided some fascinating insights into bilingualism but
also revealed new issues related to brain plasticity and language learning.

Astrocyte Ca(2+) signalling has been proposed to link neuronal information in
different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve a higher level of brain
integration. However, some discrepancies in the results of recent studies
challenge this view and highlight key insufficiencies in our current
understanding. In parallel, new experimental approaches that enable the study of 
astrocyte physiology at higher spatial-temporal resolution in intact brain
preparations are beginning to reveal an unexpected level of compartmentalization 
and sophistication in astrocytic Ca(2+) dynamics. This newly revealed complexity 
needs to be attentively considered in order to understand how astrocytes may
contribute to brain information processing.

The loss of a limb or paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury has devastating
consequences on quality of life. One approach to restoring lost sensory and motor
abilities in amputees and patients with tetraplegia is to supply them with
implants that provide a direct interface with the CNS. Such brain-machine
interfaces might enable a patient to exert voluntary control over a prosthetic or
robotic limb or over the electrically induced contractions of paralysed muscles. 
A parallel interface could convey sensory information about the consequences of
these movements back to the patient. Recent developments in the algorithms that
decode motor intention from neuronal activity and in approaches to convey sensory
feedback by electrically stimulating neurons, using biomimetic and
adaptation-based approaches, have shown the promise of invasive interfaces with
sensorimotor cortices, although substantial challenges remain.

It has been over 20 years since JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) were identified
as protein kinases that are strongly activated by cellular stress and that have a
key role in apoptosis. Examination of Jnk-knockout mice and characterization of
JNK behaviour in neuronal cells has further revealed the importance of the JNK
family in the nervous system. As well as regulating neuronal death, JNKs govern
brain morphogenesis and axodendritic architecture during development, and
regulate important neuron-specific functions such as synaptic plasticity and
memory formation. This Review examines the evidence that the spatial segregation 
of JNKs in neurons underlies their distinct functions and that
compartment-specific targeting of JNKs may offer promising new therapeutic
avenues for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system, such as stroke and
neurodegenerative disorders.

Mononuclear phagocytic cells in the CNS used to be defined according to their
anatomical location and surface marker expression. Recently, this concept has
been challenged by the results of developmental and gene expression profiling
studies that have used novel molecular biological tools to unravel the origin of 
microglia and to define their role as specialized tissue macrophages with long
lifespans. Here, we describe how these results have redefined microglia and
helped us to understand how different myeloid cell populations operate in the CNS
based on their cell-specific gene expression signatures, distinct ontogeny and
differential functions. Moreover, we describe the vulnerability of microglia to
dysfunction and propose that myelomonocytic cells might be used in the treatment 
of neurological and psychiatric disorders that are characterized by primary or
secondary 'microgliopathy'.

The size and extent of folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex are important
factors that influence a species' cognitive abilities and sensorimotor skills.
Studies in various animal models and in humans have provided insight into the
mechanisms that regulate cortical growth and folding. Both protein-coding genes
and microRNAs control cortical size, and recent progress in characterizing basal 
progenitor cells and the genes that regulate their proliferation has contributed 
to our understanding of cortical folding. Neurological disorders linked to
disruptions in cortical growth and folding have been associated with novel
neurogenetic mechanisms and aberrant signalling pathways, and these findings have
changed concepts of brain evolution and may lead to new medical treatments for
certain disorders.

Microglia, the brain's professional phagocytes, can remove dead and dying neurons
as well as synapses and the processes of live neurons. However, we and others
have recently shown that microglia can also execute neuronal death by
phagocytosing stressed-but-viable neurons - a process that we have termed
phagoptosis. In this Progress article, we discuss evidence suggesting that
phagoptosis may contribute to neuronal loss during brain development,
inflammation, ischaemia and neurodegeneration.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which cells
regulate levels of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although
it is well characterized in non-neuronal cells, a proliferation of papers over
the past few years has revealed a key role for the UPR in normal neuronal
function and as an important driver of neurodegenerative diseases. A complex
scenario is emerging in which distinct UPR signalling modules have specific and
even opposite effects on neurodegeneration depending on the disease context.
Here, we provide an overview of the most recent findings addressing the
biological relevance of ER stress in the nervous system.

Brain function relies on the ability of neurons to communicate with each other.
Interneuronal communication primarily takes place at synapses, where information 
from one neuron is rapidly conveyed to a second neuron. There are two main
modalities of synaptic transmission: chemical and electrical. Far from
functioning independently and serving unrelated functions, mounting evidence
indicates that these two modalities of synaptic transmission closely interact,
both during development and in the adult brain. Rather than conceiving synaptic
transmission as either chemical or electrical, this article emphasizes the notion
that synaptic transmission is both chemical and electrical, and that interactions
between these two forms of interneuronal communication might be required for
normal brain development and function.

We often assume that the variables of functional and structural brain parameters 
- such as synaptic weights, the firing rates of individual neurons, the
synchronous discharge of neural populations, the number of synaptic contacts
between neurons and the size of dendritic boutons - have a bell-shaped
distribution. However, at many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain, 
the distribution of numerous parameters is in fact strongly skewed with a heavy
tail, suggesting that skewed (typically lognormal) distributions are fundamental 
to structural and functional brain organization. This insight not only has
implications for how we should collect and analyse data, it may also help us to
understand how the different levels of skewed distributions - from synapses to
cognition - are related to each other.

Recent studies using transgenic mice lacking NMDA receptors in the hippocampus
challenge the long-standing hypothesis that hippocampal long-term
potentiation-like mechanisms underlie the encoding and storage of associative
long-term spatial memories. However, it may not be the synaptic
plasticity-dependent memory hypothesis that is wrong; instead, it may be the role
of the hippocampus that needs to be re-examined. We present an account of
hippocampal function that explains its role in both memory and anxiety.

Music is a universal feature of human societies, partly owing to its power to
evoke strong emotions and influence moods. During the past decade, the
investigation of the neural correlates of music-evoked emotions has been
invaluable for the understanding of human emotion. Functional neuroimaging
studies on music and emotion show that music can modulate activity in brain
structures that are known to be crucially involved in emotion, such as the
amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, hippocampus, insula, cingulate cortex 
and orbitofrontal cortex. The potential of music to modulate activity in these
structures has important implications for the use of music in the treatment of
psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Gephyrin: a master regulator of neuronal function?

The neurotransmitters GABA and glycine mediate fast synaptic inhibition by
activating ligand-gated chloride channels--namely, type A GABA (GABA(A)) and
glycine receptors. Both types of receptors are anchored postsynaptically by
gephyrin, which self-assembles into a scaffold and interacts with the
cytoskeleton. Current research indicates that postsynaptic gephyrin clusters are 
dynamic assemblies that are held together and regulated by multiple
protein-protein interactions. Moreover, post-translational modifications of
gephyrin regulate the formation and plasticity of GABAergic synapses by altering 
the clustering properties of postsynaptic scaffolds and thereby the availability 
and function of receptors and other signalling molecules. Here, we discuss the
formation and regulation of the gephyrin scaffold, its role in GABAergic and
glycinergic synaptic function and the implications for the pathophysiology of
brain disorders caused by abnormal inhibitory neurotransmission.

Left-handers are often excluded from study cohorts in neuroscience and
neurogenetics in order to reduce variance in the data. However, recent
investigations have shown that the inclusion or targeted recruitment of
left-handers can be informative in studies on a range of topics, such as cerebral
lateralization and the genetic underpinning of asymmetrical brain development.
Left-handed individuals represent a substantial portion of the human population
and therefore left-handedness falls within the normal range of human diversity;
thus, it is important to account for this variation in our understanding of brain
functioning. We call for neuroscientists and neurogeneticists to recognize the
potential of studying this often-discarded group of research subjects.

There is now compelling evidence that the allocation of memory to specific
neurons (neuronal allocation) and synapses (synaptic allocation) in a
neurocircuit is not random and that instead specific mechanisms, such as
increases in neuronal excitability and synaptic tagging and capture, determine
the exact sites where memories are stored. We propose an integrated view of these
processes, such that neuronal allocation, synaptic tagging and capture, spine
clustering and metaplasticity reflect related aspects of memory allocation
mechanisms. Importantly, the properties of these mechanisms suggest a set of
rules that profoundly affect how memories are stored and recalled.

Functional MRI-based lie detection: scientific and societal challenges.

Farah MJ, Hutchinson JB, Phelps EA, Wagner AD.

Erratum in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Apr;15(4):278.

Functional MRI (fMRI)-based lie detection has been marketed as a tool for
enhancing personnel selection, strengthening national security and protecting
personal reputations, and at least three US courts have been asked to admit the
results of lie detection scans as evidence during trials. How well does
fMRI-based lie detection perform, and how should the courts, and society more
generally, respond? Here, we address various questions — some of which are based 
on a meta-analysis of published studies — concerning the scientific state of the 
art in fMRI-based lie detection and its legal status, and discuss broader ethical
and societal implications. We close with three general policy recommendations.

Synaptic changes induced by melanocortin signalling.

Caruso V, Lagerström MC, Olszewski PK, Fredriksson R, Schiöth HB.

The melanocortin system has a well-established role in the regulation of energy
homeostasis, but there is growing evidence of its involvement in memory,
nociception, mood disorders and addiction. In this Review, we focus on the role
of the melanocortin 4 receptor and provide an integrative view of the molecular
mechanisms that lead to melanocortin-induced changes in synaptic plasticity
within these diverse physiological systems. We also highlight the importance of
melanocortin peptides and receptors in chronic pain syndromes, memory
impairments, depression and drug abuse, and the possibility of targeting them for
therapeutic purposes.

Mammalian brains exhibit population oscillations, the structures of which vary in
time and space according to behavioural state. A proposed function of these
oscillations is to control the flow of signals among anatomically connected
networks. However, the nature of neural coding that may support selective
communication that depends on oscillations has received relatively little
attention. Here, we consider the role of multiplexing, whereby multiple
information streams share a common neural substrate. We suggest that multiplexing
implemented through periodic modulation of firing-rate population codes enables
flexible reconfiguration of effective connectivity among brain areas.

Neurons integrate synaptic inputs across time and space, a process that
determines the transformation of input signals into action potential output. This
article explores how synaptic integration contributes to the richness of sensory 
signalling in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices. Whether a neuron receives a
few or a few thousand discrete inputs, most evoked synaptic activity generates
only subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations. Sensory tuning of synaptic
inputs is typically broad, but short-term dynamics and the interplay between
excitation and inhibition restrict action potential firing to narrow windows of
opportunity. We highlight the challenges and limitations of the use of somatic
recordings in the study of synaptic integration and the importance of active
dendritic mechanisms in sensory processing.

Microglia and macrophages in the CNS contain multimolecular complexes termed
inflammasomes. Inflammasomes function as intracellular sensors for infectious
agents as well as for host-derived danger signals that are associated with
neurological diseases, including meningitis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
Assembly of an inflammasome activates caspase 1 and, subsequently, the
proteolysis and release of the cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, as
well as pyroptotic cell death. Since the discovery of inflammasomes in 2002,
there has been burgeoning recognition of their complexities and functions. Here, 
we review the current understanding of the functions of different inflammasomes
in the CNS and their roles in neurological diseases.

Chemicals that are used experimentally to evoke itch elicit activity in diverse
subpopulations of cutaneous pruriceptive neurons, all of which also respond to
painful stimuli. However, itch is distinct from pain: it evokes different
behaviours, such as scratching, and originates from the skin or certain mucosae
but not from muscle, joints or viscera. New insights regarding the neurons that
mediate the sensation of itch have been gained from experiments in which gene
expression has been manipulated in different types of pruriceptive neurons as
well as from comparisons between psychophysical measurements of itch and the
neuronal discharges and other properties of peripheral and central pruriceptive
neurons.

The remarkable ability of a single axon to extend multiple branches and form
terminal arbors enables vertebrate neurons to integrate information from
divergent regions of the nervous system. Axons select appropriate pathways during
development, but it is the branches that extend interstitially from the axon
shaft and arborize at specific targets that are responsible for virtually all of 
the synaptic connectivity in the vertebrate CNS. How do axons form branches at
specific target regions? Recent studies have identified molecular cues that
activate intracellular signalling pathways in axons and mediate dynamic
reorganization of the cytoskeleton to promote the formation of axon branches.

Criminal behaviour and violence are increasingly viewed as worldwide public
health problems. A growing body of knowledge shows that criminal behaviour has a 
neurobiological basis, and this has intensified judicial interest in the
potential application of neuroscience to criminal law. It also gives rise to
important questions. What are the implications of such application for predicting
future criminal behaviour and protecting society? Can it be used to prevent
violence? And what are the implications for the way offenders are punished?

Axon-soma communication in neuronal injury.

The extensive lengths of neuronal processes necessitate efficient mechanisms for 
communication with the cell body. Neuronal regeneration after nerve injury
requires new transcription; thus, long-distance retrograde signalling from axonal
lesion sites to the soma and nucleus is required. In recent years, considerable
progress has been made in elucidating the mechanistic basis of this system. This 
has included the discovery of a priming role for early calcium waves;
confirmation of central roles for mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling
effectors, the importin family of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors and
molecular motors such as dynein; and demonstration of the importance of local
translation as a key regulatory mechanism. These recent findings provide a
coherent mechanistic framework for axon-soma communication in the injured nerve
and shed light on the integration of cytoplasmic and nuclear transport in all
eukaryotic cells.

Neurogenic neuroinflammation: inflammatory CNS reactions in response to neuronal 
activity.

of Vienna, Spitalgasse 4, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.

The CNS is endowed with an elaborated response repertoire termed
'neuroinflammation', which enables it to cope with pathogens, toxins, traumata
and degeneration. On the basis of recent publications, we deduce that
orchestrated actions of immune cells, vascular cells and neurons that constitute 
neuroinflammation are not only provoked by pathological conditions but can also
be induced by increased neuronal activity. We suggest that the technical term
'neurogenic neuroinflammation' should be used for inflammatory reactions in the
CNS in response to neuronal activity. We believe that neurogenic
neuro-inflammation maintains homeostasis to enable the CNS to cope with enhanced 
metabolic demands and increases the computational power and plasticity of CNS
neuronal networks. However, neurogenic neuroinflammation may also become
maladaptive and aggravate the outcomes of pain, stress and epilepsy.

Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.

Kohwi M, Doe CQ.

The vast diversity of neurons and glia of the CNS is generated from a small,
heterogeneous population of progenitors that undergo transcriptional changes
during development to sequentially specify distinct cell fates. Guided by
cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic cues, invertebrate and mammalian neural progenitors
carefully regulate when and how many of each cell type is produced, enabling the 
formation of functional neural circuits. Emerging evidence indicates that neural 
progenitors also undergo changes in global chromatin architecture, thereby
restricting when a particular cell type can be generated. Studies of
temporal-identity specification and progenitor competence can provide insight
into how we could use neural progenitors to more effectively generate specific
cell types for brain repair.

AMPA-silent synapses in brain development and pathology.

Synapses are constantly generated at a high rate in the developing, prepubescent 
brain. Newly generated glutamatergic synapses lack functional AMPA
receptor-mediated transmission. Most of these 'AMPA-silent' synapses are
eliminated during the developmental period, but some are specifically selected
for AMPA unsilencing by correlated pre-and postsynaptic activity as the first
step in a process that leads to stabilization of the synapse. Premature, or
delayed, unsilencing of AMPA-silent synapses has been implicated in
neurodevelopmental disorders, and abnormal generation of AMPA-silent synapses is 
associated with brain trauma, addiction and neurodegenerative disorders, further 
highlighting the importance of AMPA-silent synapses in brain pathology.

Humour is a vital component of human socio-affective and cognitive functioning.
Recent advances in neuroscience have enabled researchers to explore this human
attribute in children and adults. Humour seems to engage a core network of
cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas
involved in detecting and resolving incongruity (mismatch between expected and
presented stimuli); and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the
amygdala, key structures for reward and salience processing. Examining
personality effects and sex differences in the neural correlates of humour may
aid in understanding typical human behaviour and the neural mechanisms underlying
neuropsychiatric disorders, which can have dramatic effects on the capacity to
experience social reward.

Adults frequently provide compelling, detailed accounts of early childhood
experiences in the courtroom. Judges and jurors are asked to decide guilt or
innocence based solely on these decades-old memories using 'common sense' notions
about memory. However, these notions are not in agreement with findings from
neuroscientific and behavioural studies of memory development. Without expert
guidance, judges and jurors may have difficulty in properly adjudicating the
weight of memory evidence in cases involving adult recollections of childhood
experiences.

Liver failure affects brain function, leading to neurological and psychiatric
alterations; such alterations are referred to as hepatic encephalopathy (HE).
Early diagnosis of minimal HE reveals an unexpectedly high incidence of mild
cognitive impairment and psychomotor slowing in patients with liver cirrhosis -
conditions that have serious health, social and economic consequences. The
mechanisms responsible for the neurological alterations in HE are beginning to
emerge. New therapeutic strategies acting on specific targets in the brain
(phosphodiesterase 5, type A GABA receptors, cyclooxygenase and mitogen-activated
protein kinase p38) have been shown to restore cognitive and motor function in
animal models of chronic HE, and NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to
increase survival in acute liver failure. This article reviews the latest studies
aimed at understanding how liver failure affects brain function and potential
ways to ameliorate these effects.

DSM-5 and RDoC: progress in psychiatry research?

Neuroscience studies into psychiatric disorders generally rely on disease
definitions that are based on the influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM), the fifth edition of which (DSM-5) was released
earlier this year. Designed as a purely diagnostic tool, the DSM considers
different disorders as distinct entities. However, boundaries between disorders
are often not as strict as the DSM suggests. To provide an alternative framework 
for research into psychiatric disorders, the US National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) has recently introduced its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
project. In the RDoC, five 'domains' each reflect a brain system in which
functioning is impaired, to different degrees, in different psychiatric
conditions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked six leading investigators for their
thoughts on how DSM-5 and the RDoC will influence neuroscience research into
psychiatric disorders.

Modelling and analysis of local field potentials for studying the function of
cortical circuits.

Life Sciences, 1432 Ås, Norway.

The past decade has witnessed a renewed interest in cortical local field
potentials (LFPs)--that is, extracellularly recorded potentials with frequencies 
of up to ~500 Hz. This is due to both the advent of multielectrodes, which has
enabled recording of LFPs at tens to hundreds of sites simultaneously, and the
insight that LFPs offer a unique window into key integrative synaptic processes
in cortical populations. However, owing to its numerous potential neural sources,
the LFP is more difficult to interpret than are spikes. Careful mathematical
modelling and analysis are needed to take full advantage of the opportunities
that this signal offers in understanding signal processing in cortical circuits
and, ultimately, the neural basis of perception and cognition.

Conduct disorder is a childhood behaviour disorder that is characterized by
persistent aggressive or antisocial behaviour that disrupts the child's
environment and impairs his or her functioning. A proportion of children with
conduct disorder have psychopathic traits. Psychopathic traits consist of a
callous-unemotional component and an impulsive-antisocial component, which are
associated with two core impairments. The first is a reduced empathic response to
the distress of other individuals, which primarily reflects reduced amygdala
responsiveness to distress cues; the second is deficits in decision making and in
reinforcement learning, which reflects dysfunction in the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex and striatum. Genetic and prenatal factors contribute to the abnormal
development of these neural systems, and social-environmental variables that
affect motivation influence the probability that antisocial behaviour will be
subsequently displayed.

The sophisticated circuitry of the neocortex is assembled from a diverse
repertoire of neuronal subtypes generated during development under precise
molecular regulation. In recent years, several key controls over the
specification and differentiation of neocortical projection neurons have been
identified. This work provides substantial insight into the 'molecular logic'
underlying cortical development and increasingly supports a model in which
individual progenitor-stage and postmitotic regulators are embedded within highly
interconnected networks that gate sequential developmental decisions. Here, we
provide an integrative account of the molecular controls that direct the
progressive development and delineation of subtype and area identity of
neocortical projection neurons.

Correlational data suggest that learned associations are encoded within neuronal 
ensembles. However, it has been difficult to prove that neuronal ensembles
mediate learned behaviours because traditional pharmacological and lesion
methods, and even newer cell type-specific methods, affect both activated and
non-activated neurons. In addition, previous studies on synaptic and molecular
alterations induced by learning did not distinguish between behaviourally
activated and non-activated neurons. Here, we describe three new
approaches--Daun02 inactivation, FACS sorting of activated neurons and Fos-GFP
transgenic rats--that have been used to selectively target and study activated
neuronal ensembles in models of conditioned drug effects and relapse. We also
describe two new tools--Fos-tTA transgenic mice and inactivation of
CREB-overexpressing neurons--that have been used to study the role of neuronal
ensembles in conditioned fear.

Recent developments in functional neuroimaging have provided a number of new
tools for assessing patients who clinically appear to be in a vegetative state.
These techniques have been able to reveal awareness and even allow rudimentary
communication in some patients who remain entirely behaviourally non-responsive. 
The implications of these results extend well beyond the immediate clinical and
scientific findings to influencing legal proceedings, raising new ethical
questions about the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration and providing new
options for patients and families in that decision-making process. The findings
have also motivated significant public discourse about the role of neuroscience
research in society.

Since the identification of the causative gene in Huntington's disease (HD), a
number of animal models of this disorder have been developed. A frequently asked 
question is: which of these models most closely recapitulates the human disease? 
In this Review, we provide an overview of the currently available animal models
of HD in the context of the clinical features of the disease. In doing so, we
highlight their strengths and limitations for modelling specific symptoms of the 
disease. This should highlight the animal model that is best suited to address a 
particular question of interest and, ultimately, to expedite the discovery of
treatments that will prevent or slow the progression of HD.

The what, where and how of auditory-object perception.

The fundamental perceptual unit in hearing is the 'auditory object'. Similar to
visual objects, auditory objects are the computational result of the auditory
system's capacity to detect, extract, segregate and group spectrotemporal
regularities in the acoustic environment; the multitude of acoustic stimuli
around us together form the auditory scene. However, unlike the visual scene,
resolving the component objects within the auditory scene crucially depends on
their temporal structure. Neural correlates of auditory objects are found
throughout the auditory system. However, neural responses do not become
correlated with a listener's perceptual reports until the level of the cortex.
The roles of different neural structures and the contribution of different
cognitive states to the perception of auditory objects are not yet fully
understood.

Genes and circuits of courtship behaviour in Drosophila males.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the causal links among a complex behaviour, single
neurons and single genes can be demonstrated through experimental manipulations. 
A key player in establishing the male courtship circuitry is the fruitless (fru) 
gene, the expression of which yields the FruM proteins in a subset of male but
not female neurons. FruM probably regulates chromatin states, leading to
single-neuron sex differences and, consequently, a sexually dimorphic circuitry. 
The mutual connections among fru-expressing neurons--including primary sensory
afferents, central interneurons such as the P1 neuron cluster that triggers
courtship, and courtship motor pattern generators--probably form the core portion
of the male courtship circuitry.

Neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being offered in court cases.
Consequently, the legal system needs neuroscientists to act as expert witnesses
who can explain the limitations and interpretations of neuroscientific findings
so that judges and jurors can make informed and appropriate inferences. The
growing role of neuroscientists in court means that neuroscientists should be
aware of important differences between the scientific and legal fields, and,
especially, how scientific facts can be easily misunderstood by non-scientists,
including judges and jurors.

p11 and its role in depression and therapeutic responses to antidepressants.

Svenningsson P, Kim Y, Warner-Schmidt J, Oh YS, Greengard P.

Studies of the multifunctional protein p11 (also known as S100A10) are shedding
light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying depression. Here, we
review data implicating p11 in both the amplification of serotonergic signalling 
and the regulation of gene transcription. We summarize studies demonstrating that
levels of p11 are regulated in depression and by antidepressant regimens and,
conversely, that p11 regulates depression-like behaviours and/or responses to
antidepressants. Current and future studies of p11 may provide a molecular and
cellular framework for the development of novel antidepressant therapies.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) occupies a notable proportion of the CNS and
contributes to its normal physiology. Alterations to the ECM occur after neural
injury (for example, in multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or Alzheimer's
disease) and can have drastic consequences. Of note, injury-induced changes in
chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs)--a family of ECM proteoglycans--can
lead to the inhibition of myelin repair. Here, we highlight the
pathophysiological roles of the brain's ECM, particularly those of CSPGs, after
neural insults and discuss how the ECM can be targeted to promote remyelination.

Despite cash-strapped times for research, several ambitious collaborative
neuroscience projects have attracted large amounts of funding and media
attention. In Europe, the Human Brain Project aims to develop a large-scale
computer simulation of the brain, whereas in the United States, the Brain
Activity Map is working towards establishing a functional connectome of the
entire brain, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science has embarked upon a
10-year project to understand the mouse visual cortex (the MindScope project). US
President Barack Obama's announcement of the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research
through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative) in April 2013
highlights the political commitment to neuroscience and is expected to further
foster interdisciplinary collaborations, accelerate the development of new
technologies and thus fuel much needed medical advances. In this Viewpoint
article, five prominent neuroscientists explain the aims of the projects and how 
they are addressing some of the questions (and criticisms) that have arisen.

Mood disorders are common and debilitating conditions characterized in part by
profound deficits in reward-related behavioural domains. A recent literature has 
identified important structural and functional alterations within the brain's
reward circuitry--particularly in the ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens
pathway--that are associated with symptoms such as anhedonia and aberrant
reward-associated perception and memory. This Review synthesizes recent data from
human and rodent studies from which emerges a circuit-level framework for
understanding reward deficits in depression. We also discuss some of the
molecular and cellular underpinnings of this framework, ranging from adaptations 
in glutamatergic synapses and neurotrophic factors to transcriptional and
epigenetic mechanisms.

Nuclear calcium signalling in the regulation of brain function.

Synaptic activity initiates biochemical processes that have various outcomes,
including the formation of memories, increases in neuronal survival and the
development of chronic pain and addiction. Virtually all activity-induced,
long-lasting adaptations of brain functions require a dialogue between synapses
and the nucleus that results in changes in gene expression. Calcium signals that 
are induced by synaptic activity and propagate into the nucleus are a major route
for synapse-to-nucleus communication. Recent findings indicate that diverse forms
of neuroadaptation require calcium transients in the nucleus to switch on the
necessary genomic programme. Deficits in nuclear calcium signalling as a result
of a reduction in synaptic activity or increased extrasynaptic NMDA receptor
signalling may underlie the aetiologies of various diseases, including
neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.

The neuroscience of memory: implications for the courtroom.

Although memory can be hazy at times, it is often assumed that memories of
violent or otherwise stressful events are so well encoded that they are
effectively indelible and that confidently retrieved memories are almost
certainly accurate. However, findings from basic psychological research and
neuroscience studies indicate that memory is a reconstructive process that is
susceptible to distortion. In the courtroom, even minor memory distortions can
have severe consequences that are partly driven by common misunderstandings about
memory--for example, that memory is more veridical than it may actually be.

Like all cells, neurons are made of proteins that have characteristic synthesis
and degradation profiles. Unlike other cells, however, neurons have a unique
multipolar architecture that makes ∼10,000 synaptic contacts with other neurons. 
Both the stability and modifiability of the neuronal proteome are crucial for its
information-processing, storage and plastic properties. The cell biological
mechanisms that synthesize, modify, deliver and degrade dendritic and synaptic
proteins are not well understood but appear to reflect unique solutions adapted
to the particular morphology of neurons.

Dementia is increasingly being recognized in cases of Parkinson's disease (PD);
such cases are termed PD dementia (PDD). The spread of fibrillar α-synuclein
(α-syn) pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures seems
to be the strongest neuropathological correlate of emerging dementia in PD. In
addition, up to 50% of patients with PDD also develop sufficient numbers of
amyloid-β plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles for a secondary
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and these pathologies may act synergistically
with α-syn pathology to confer a worse prognosis. An understanding of the
relationships between these three distinct pathologies and their resultant
clinical phenotypes is crucial for the development of effective disease-modifying
treatments for PD and PDD.

Hypnosis uses the powerful effects of attention and suggestion to produce, modify
and enhance a broad range of subjectively compelling experiences and behaviours. 
For more than a century, hypnotic suggestion has been used successfully as an
adjunctive procedure to treat a wide range of clinical conditions. More recently,
hypnosis has attracted a growing interest from a cognitive neuroscience
perspective. Recent studies using hypnotic suggestion show how manipulating
subjective awareness in the laboratory can provide insights into brain mechanisms
involved in attention, motor control, pain perception, beliefs and volition.
Moreover, they indicate that hypnotic suggestion can create informative analogues
of clinical conditions that may be useful for understanding these conditions and 
their treatments.

In the developing brain, dendrite branches and dendritic spines form and turn
over dynamically. By contrast, most dendrite arbors and dendritic spines in the
adult brain are stable for months, years and possibly even decades. Emerging
evidence reveals that dendritic spine and dendrite arbor stability have crucial
roles in the correct functioning of the adult brain and that loss of stability is
associated with psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent
findings have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie
long-term dendrite stabilization, how these mechanisms differ from those used to 
mediate structural plasticity and how they are disrupted in disease.

Planar cell polarity (PCP) is complementary to the intrinsic polarization of
single cells and refers to the global coordination of cell behaviour in the plane
of a tissue and, by extension, to the signalling pathways that control it. PCP is
most evident in cell sheets, and research into PCP was for years confined to
studies in Drosophila melanogaster. However, PCP has more recently emerged as an 
important phenomenon in vertebrates, in which it regulates various developmental 
processes and is associated with multiple disorders. In particular, core PCP
genes are crucial for the development and function of the nervous system. They
are involved in neural tube closure, ependymal polarity, neuronal migration,
dendritic growth and axon guidance.

Abnormal accumulation of brain iron has been detected in various
neurodegenerative diseases, but the contribution of iron overload to pathology
remains unclear. In a group of distinctive brain iron overload diseases known as 
'neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation' (NBIA) diseases, nine disease
genes have been identified. Brain iron accumulation is observed in the globus
pallidus and other brain regions in NBIA diseases, which are often associated
with severe dystonia and gait abnormalities. Only two of these diseases,
aceruloplasminaemia and neuroferritinopathy, are directly caused by abnormalities
in iron metabolism, mainly in astrocytes and neurons, respectively. Understanding
the early molecular pathophysiology of these diseases should aid insights into
the role of iron and the design of specific therapeutic approaches.

Many psychoactive drugs are used recreationally, particularly by young people.
This use and its perceived dangers have led to many different classes of drugs
being banned under national laws and international conventions. Indeed, the
possession of cannabis, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA; also known 
as ecstasy) and psychedelics is stringently regulated. An important and
unfortunate outcome of the controls placed on these and other psychoactive drugs 
is that they make research into their mechanisms of action and potential
therapeutic uses - for example, in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder 
- difficult and in many cases almost impossible.

Uncertainty about a possible future threat disrupts our ability to avoid it or to
mitigate its negative impact and thus results in anxiety. Here, we focus the
broad literature on the neurobiology of anxiety through the lens of uncertainty. 
We identify five processes that are essential for adaptive anticipatory responses
to future threat uncertainty and propose that alterations in the neural
instantiation of these processes result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty
in pathological anxiety. This framework has the potential to advance the
classification, diagnosis and treatment of clinical anxiety.

Histamine acts as a modulatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. It has an
important role in the maintenance of wakefulness, and dysfunction in the
histaminergic system has been linked to narcolepsy. Recent evidence suggests that
aberrant histamine signalling in the brain may also be a key factor in Gilles de 
la Tourette syndrome, Parkinson's disease and addictive behaviours. Furthermore, 
multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, which is an
often-used model for MS, are associated with changes in the histaminergic system.
This Review explores the possible roles of brain histamine in the mechanisms
underlying these diseases.

Why do neurons sense extracellular acid? In large part, this question has driven 
increasing investigation on acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the CNS and the 
peripheral nervous system for the past two decades. Significant progress has been
made in understanding the structure and function of ASICs at the molecular level.
Studies aimed at clarifying their physiological importance have suggested roles
for ASICs in pain, neurological and psychiatric disease. This Review highlights
recent findings linking these channels to physiology and disease. In addition, it
discusses some of the implications for therapy and points out questions that
remain unanswered.

The influence of neuroscience on US Supreme Court decisions about adolescents'
criminal culpability.

Steinberg L(1).

Author information:

USA. laurence.steinberg@temple.edu

In the past 8 years, the US Supreme Court has issued landmark opinions in three
cases that involved the criminal culpability of juveniles. In the most recent
case, in 2012, a ruling prohibited states from mandating life without parole for 
crimes committed by minors. In these cases, the Court drew on scientific studies 
of the adolescent brain in concluding that adolescents, by virtue of their
inherent psychological and neurobiological immaturity, are not as responsible for
their behaviour as adults. This article discusses the Court's rationale in these 
cases and the role of scientific evidence about adolescent brain development in
its decisions. I conclude that the neuroscientific evidence was probably
persuasive to the Court not because it revealed something new about the nature of
adolescence but precisely because it aligned with common sense and behavioural
science.

Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in our modern world,
with millions of people debilitated by conditions such as back pain, headache and
arthritis. To address this growing problem, many people are turning to mind-body 
therapies, including meditation, yoga and cognitive behavioural therapy. This
article will review the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain by
cognitive and emotional states - important components of mind-body therapies. It 
will also examine the accumulating evidence that chronic pain itself alters brain
circuitry, including that involved in endogenous pain control, suggesting that
controlling pain becomes increasingly difficult as pain becomes chronic.

The richness of perceptual experience, as well as its usefulness for guiding
behaviour, depends on the synthesis of information across multiple senses. Recent
decades have witnessed a surge in our understanding of how the brain combines
sensory cues. Much of this research has been guided by one of two distinct
approaches: one is driven primarily by neurophysiological observations, and the
other is guided by principles of mathematical psychology and psychophysics.
Conflicting results and interpretations have contributed to a conceptual gap
between psychophysical and physiological accounts of cue integration, but recent 
studies of visual-vestibular cue integration have narrowed this gap considerably.

NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels and are crucial for
neuronal communication. NMDARs form tetrameric complexes that consist of several 
homologous subunits. The subunit composition of NMDARs is plastic, resulting in a
large number of receptor subtypes. As each receptor subtype has distinct
biophysical, pharmacological and signalling properties, there is great interest
in determining whether individual subtypes carry out specific functions in the
CNS in both normal and pathological conditions. Here, we review the effects of
subunit composition on NMDAR properties, synaptic plasticity and cellular
mechanisms implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the rules and 
roles of NMDAR diversity could provide new therapeutic strategies against
dysfunctions of glutamatergic transmission.

Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction is a key
pathophysiological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's
disease. Understanding the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in
synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis, the impact of the BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease-relevant endophenotypes - including episodic 
memory and hippocampal volume - and the technological progress in measuring
synaptic changes in humans all pave the way for a 'synaptic repair' therapy for
neurodegenerative diseases that targets pathophysiology rather than pathogenesis.
This article reviews the key issues in translating BDNF biology into synaptic
repair therapies.

Sleep and the single neuron: the role of global slow oscillations in individual
cell rest.

Sleep is universal in animals, but its specific functions remain elusive. We
propose that sleep's primary function is to allow individual neurons to perform
prophylactic cellular maintenance. Just as muscle cells must rest after strenuous
exercise to prevent long-term damage, brain cells must rest after intense
synaptic activity. We suggest that periods of reduced synaptic input ('off
periods' or 'down states') are necessary for such maintenance. This in turn
requires a state of globally synchronized neuronal activity, reduced sensory
input and behavioural immobility - the well-known manifestations of sleep.

The contextual brain: implications for fear conditioning, extinction and
psychopathology.

Contexts surround and imbue meaning to events; they are essential for
recollecting the past, interpreting the present and anticipating the future.
Indeed, the brain's capacity to contextualize information permits enormous
cognitive and behavioural flexibility. Studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning and
extinction in rodents and humans suggest that a neural circuit including the
hippocampus, amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex is involved in the learning
and memory processes that enable context-dependent behaviour. Dysfunction in this
network may be involved in several forms of psychopathology, including
post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.

Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder associated with significant
morbidity and mortality, but the only available drug therapies target its
symptoms rather than the underlying cause. The process that links brain injury or
other predisposing factors to the subsequent emergence of epilepsy is termed
epileptogenesis. Substantial research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms
of epileptogenesis so as to identify more specific targets for intervention, with
the hope of preventing epilepsy before seizures emerge. Recent work has yielded
important conceptual advances in this field. We suggest that such insights into
the mechanisms of epileptogenesis converge at the level of cortical circuit
dysfunction.

Astrocytes are now emerging as key participants in many aspects of brain
development, function and disease. In particular, new evidence shows that
astrocytes powerfully control the formation, maturation, function and elimination
of synapses through various secreted and contact-mediated signals. Astrocytes are
also increasingly being implicated in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and
neurological disorders that result from synaptic defects. A better understanding 
of how astrocytes regulate neural circuit development and function in the healthy
and diseased brain might lead to the development of therapeutic agents to treat
these diseases.

Re-entrant or feedback pathways between cortical areas carry rich and varied
information about behavioural context, including attention, expectation,
perceptual tasks, working memory and motor commands. Neurons receiving such
inputs effectively function as adaptive processors that are able to assume
different functional states according to the task being executed. Recent data
suggest that the selection of particular inputs, representing different
components of an association field, enable neurons to take on different
functional roles. In this Review, we discuss the various top-down influences
exerted on the visual cortical pathways and highlight the dynamic nature of the
receptive field, which allows neurons to carry information that is relevant to
the current perceptual demands.

A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a true
effect, but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces the
likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect. Here, 
we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is
very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low
reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as
unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in
neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but
often ignored methodological principles.

Imaging structural co-variance between human brain regions.

Brain structure varies between people in a markedly organized fashion.
Communities of brain regions co-vary in their morphological properties. For
example, cortical thickness in one region influences the thickness of
structurally and functionally connected regions. Such networks of structural
co-variance partially recapitulate the functional networks of healthy individuals
and the foci of grey matter loss in neurodegenerative disease. This architecture 
is genetically heritable, is associated with behavioural and cognitive abilities 
and is changed systematically across the lifespan. The biological meaning of this
structural co-variance remains controversial, but it appears to reflect
developmental coordination or synchronized maturation between areas of the brain.
This Review discusses the state of current research into brain structural
co-variance, its underlying mechanisms and its potential value in the
understanding of various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

Inverse comorbidity is a lower-than-expected probability of disease occuring in
individuals who have been diagnosed with other medical conditions. Emerging
evidence points to inverse cancer comorbidity in people with certain CNS
disorders. In this Opinion article, we discuss the evidence for this intriguing
association and possible underlying mechanisms. We believe that this association 
is an invaluable opportunity to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these
diseases, and understanding why certain individuals with CNS disorders are
protected against many different types of cancer could help to develop new and
improved treatments.

Corticostriatal projections are essential components of forebrain circuits and
are widely involved in motivated behaviour. These axonal projections are formed
by two distinct classes of cortical neurons, intratelencephalic (IT) and
pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Convergent evidence points to IT versus PT
differentiation of the corticostriatal system at all levels of functional
organization, from cellular signalling mechanisms to circuit topology. There is
also growing evidence for IT/PT imbalance as an aetiological factor in
neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and movement disorders - autism, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, Huntington's and
Parkinson's diseases and major depression are highlighted here.

The aquaporins (AQPs) are plasma membrane water-transporting proteins. AQP4 is
the principal member of this protein family in the CNS, where it is expressed in 
astrocytes and is involved in water movement, cell migration and neuroexcitation.
AQP1 is expressed in the choroid plexus, where it facilitates cerebrospinal fluid
secretion, and in dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it tunes pain perception.
The AQPs are potential drug targets for several neurological conditions.
Astrocytoma cells strongly express AQP4, which may facilitate their infiltration 
into the brain, and the neuroinflammatory disease neuromyelitis optica is caused 
by AQP4-specific autoantibodies that produce complement-mediated astrocytic
damage.

Myosins are a large family of actin-based cytoskeletal motors that use energy
derived from ATP hydrolysis to generate movement and force. Myosins of classes
II, V and VI have specific pre- and postsynaptic roles that are required for
synapse function. They also facilitate several forms of synaptic plasticity.
Interestingly, the myosins of these classes differ markedly in important aspects 
of their molecular mechanisms of function. Accordingly, their major roles at
synapses are diverse and include the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in
dendritic spines and powering of synaptic cargo transport.

Several recent breakthroughs have provided notable insights into the pathogenesis
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with some even shifting our thinking
about this neurodegenerative disease and raising the question as to whether this 
disorder is a proteinopathy, a ribonucleopathy or both. In addition, these
breakthroughs have revealed mechanistic links between ALS and frontotemporal
dementia, as well as between ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as
the cerebellar atrophies, myotonic dystrophy and inclusion body myositis. Here,
we summarize the new findings in ALS research, discuss what they have taught us
about this disease and examine issues that are still outstanding.

Attentional enhancement of spatial resolution: linking behavioural and

Attention allows us to select relevant sensory information for preferential
processing. Behaviourally, it improves performance in various visual tasks. One
prominent effect of attention is the modulation of performance in tasks that
involve the visual system's spatial resolution. Physiologically, attention
modulates neuronal responses and alters the profile and position of receptive
fields near the attended location. Here, we develop a hypothesis linking the
behavioural and electrophysiological evidence. The proposed framework seeks to
explain how these receptive field changes enhance the visual system's effective
spatial resolution and how the same mechanisms may also underlie attentional

The specialized architecture of neurons necessitates unique modes of
intracellular communication to allow for cell survival, the ability to detect and
respond to injury and aspects of neuronal development, such as axon and dendrite 
growth, plasticity, and synapse and circuit formation. Many of these neuronal
processes rely on signal transduction pathways and transcriptional programmes
that are activated by retrograde signals originating from target-derived cues
that act on distal axons. Here, we review the many functions of long-range distal
axon-to-cell body signalling and discuss mechanisms of retrograde target-derived 
growth factor signalling.

A large number of competing models exist for how the brain creates a
representation of time. However, several human and animal studies point to
'climbing neural activation' as a potential neural mechanism for the
representation of duration. Neurophysiological recordings in animals have
revealed how climbing neural activation that peaks at the end of a timed interval
underlies the processing of duration, and, in humans, climbing neural activity in
the insular cortex, which is associated with feeling states of the body and
emotions, may be related to the cumulative representation of time.

A systematic classification and accepted nomenclature of neuron types is much
needed but is currently lacking. This article describes a possible taxonomical
solution for classifying GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex based on a
novel, web-based interactive system that allows experts to classify neurons with 
pre-determined criteria. Using Bayesian analysis and clustering algorithms on the
resulting data, we investigated the suitability of several anatomical terms and
neuron names for cortical GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, we show that
supervised classification models could automatically categorize interneurons in
agreement with experts' assignments. These results demonstrate a practical and
objective approach to the naming, characterization and classification of neurons 
based on community consensus.

The intracellular transport of organelles along an axon is crucial for the
maintenance and function of a neuron. Anterograde axonal transport has a role in 
supplying proteins and lipids to the distal synapse and mitochondria for local
energy requirements, whereas retrograde transport is involved in the clearance of
misfolded and aggregated proteins from the axon and the intracellular transport
of distal trophic signals to the soma. Axonal transport can be affected by
alterations to various components of the transport machinery. Here, we review the
current state of knowledge about axonal transport defects that might contribute
to the pathogenesis of particular neurodegenerative diseases.

Feelings are mental experiences of body states. They signify physiological need
(for example, hunger), tissue injury (for example, pain), optimal function (for
example, well-being), threats to the organism (for example, fear or anger) or
specific social interactions (for example, compassion, gratitude or love).
Feelings constitute a crucial component of the mechanisms of life regulation,
from simple to complex. Their neural substrates can be found at all levels of the
nervous system, from individual neurons to subcortical nuclei and cortical
regions.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity both
in civilian life and on the battlefield worldwide. Survivors of TBI frequently
experience long-term disabling changes in cognition, sensorimotor function and
personality. Over the past three decades, animal models have been developed to
replicate the various aspects of human TBI, to better understand the underlying
pathophysiology and to explore potential treatments. Nevertheless, promising
neuroprotective drugs that were identified as being effective in animal TBI
models have all failed in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials. This failure in 
clinical translation of preclinical studies highlights a compelling need to
revisit the current status of animal models of TBI and therapeutic strategies.

When we attempt to fix our gaze, our eyes nevertheless produce so-called
'fixational eye movements', which include microsaccades, drift and tremor.
Fixational eye movements thwart neural adaptation to unchanging stimuli and thus 
prevent and reverse perceptual fading during fixation. Over the past 10 years,
microsaccade research has become one of the most active fields in visual,
oculomotor and even cognitive neuroscience. The similarities and differences
between microsaccades and saccades have been a most intriguing area of study, and
the results of this research are leading us towards a unified theory of saccadic 
and microsaccadic function.

Histone acetylation: molecular mnemonics on the chromatin.

Gräff J(1), Tsai LH.

Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

Long-lasting memories require specific gene expression programmes that are, in
part, orchestrated by epigenetic mechanisms. Of the epigenetic modifications
identified in cognitive processes, histone acetylation has spurred considerable
interest. Whereas increments in histone acetylation have consistently been shown 
to favour learning and memory, a lack thereof has been causally implicated in
cognitive impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegeneration and
ageing. As histone acetylation and cognitive functions can be pharmacologically
restored by histone deacetylase inhibitors, this epigenetic modification might
constitute a molecular memory aid on the chromatin and, by extension, a new
template for therapeutic interventions against cognitive frailty.

What evolutionary events led to the emergence of human cognition? Although the
genetic differences separating modern humans from both non-human primates (for
example, chimpanzees) and archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) are
known, linking human-specific mutations to the cognitive phenotype remains a
challenge. One strategy is to focus on human-specific changes at the level of
intermediate phenotypes, such as gene expression and metabolism, in conjunction
with evolutionary changes in gene regulation involving transcription factors,
microRNA and proximal regulatory elements. In this Review we show how this
strategy has yielded some of the first hints about the mechanisms of human
cognition.

Disorders characterized by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, Lewy body formation 
and parkinsonism (and in some cases dementia) are collectively known as Lewy body
diseases. The molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) through which α-syn abnormally 
accumulates and contributes to neurodegeneration in these disorders remains
unknown. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge and prevailing
hypotheses regarding the conformational, oligomerization and aggregation states
of α-syn and their role in regulating α-syn function in health and disease.
Understanding the nature of the various α-syn structures, how they are formed and
their relative contributions to α-syn-mediated toxicity may inform future studies
aiming to develop therapeutic prevention and intervention.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)--a member of a small family of secreted 
proteins that includes nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 and neurotrophin
4--has emerged as a key regulator of neural circuit development and function. The
expression, secretion and actions of BDNF are directly controlled by neural
activity, and secreted BDNF is capable of mediating many activity-dependent
processes in the mammalian brain, including neuronal differentiation and growth, 
synapse formation and plasticity, and higher cognitive functions. This Review
summarizes some of the recent progress in understanding the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying neurotrophin regulation of neural circuits. The
focus of the article is on BDNF, as this is the most widely expressed and studied
neurotrophin in the mammalian brain.

The Na(V)1.7 sodium channel: from molecule to man.

The voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.7 is preferentially expressed in
peripheral somatic and visceral sensory neurons, olfactory sensory neurons and
sympathetic ganglion neurons. Na(V)1.7 accumulates at nerve fibre endings and
amplifies small subthreshold depolarizations, poising it to act as a threshold
channel that regulates excitability. Genetic and functional studies have added to
the evidence that Na(V)1.7 is a major contributor to pain signalling in humans,
and homology modelling based on crystal structures of ion channels suggests an
atomic-level structural basis for the altered gating of mutant Na(V)1.7 that
causes pain.

Wired on sugar: the role of the CNS in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.

Grayson BE(1), Seeley RJ, Sandoval DA.

Author information: 
(1)Metabolic Diseases Institute, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio
45237, USA.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)--disorders of energy homeostasis and 
glucose homeostasis, respectively--are tightly linked and the incidences of both 
conditions are increasing in parallel. The CNS integrates information regarding
peripheral nutrient and hormonal changes and processes this information to
regulate energy homeostasis. Recent findings indicate that some of the neural
circuits and mechanisms underlying energy balance are also essential for the
regulation of glucose homeostasis. We propose that disruption of these
overlapping pathways links the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and
T2DM. A better understanding of these converging mechanisms may lead to
therapeutic strategies that target both T2DM and obesity.

The circadian clock: a framework linking metabolism, epigenetics and neuronal
function.

The circadian clock machinery is responsible for biological timekeeping on a
systemic level. The central clock system controls peripheral clocks through a
number of output cues that synchronize the system as a whole. There is growing
evidence that changing cellular metabolic states have important effects on
circadian rhythms and can thereby influence neuronal function and disease.
Epigenetic control has also been implicated in the modulation of biological
timekeeping, and cellular metabolism and epigenetic state seem to be closely
linked. We discuss the idea that cellular metabolic state and epigenetic
mechanisms might work through the circadian clock to regulate neuronal function
and influence disease states.

Synaptic transmission in the brain generally depends on action potentials.
However, recent studies indicate that subthreshold variation in the presynaptic
membrane potential also determines spike-evoked transmission. The informational
content of each presynaptic action potential is therefore greater than initially 
expected. The contribution of this synaptic property, which is a fast (from 0.01 
to 10 s) and state-dependent modulation of functional coupling, has been largely 
underestimated and could have important consequences for our understanding of
information processing in neural networks. We discuss here how the membrane
voltage of the presynaptic terminal might modulate neurotransmitter release by
mechanisms that do not involve a change in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx.

All cells are influenced by mechanical forces. In the brain, force-generating and
load-bearing proteins twist, turn, ratchet, flex, compress, expand and bend to
mediate neuronal signalling and plasticity. Although the functions of
mechanosensitive proteins have been thoroughly described in classical sensory
systems, the effects of endogenous mechanical energy on cellular function in the 
brain have received less attention, and many working models in neuroscience do
not currently integrate principles of cellular mechanics. An understanding of
cellular-mechanical concepts is essential to allow the integration of
mechanobiology into ongoing studies of brain structure and function.

A clear majority of patients with chronic pain are women; however, it has been
surprisingly difficult to determine whether this sex bias corresponds to actual
sex differences in pain sensitivity. A survey of the currently available
epidemiological and laboratory data indicates that the evidence for clinical and 
experimental sex differences in pain is overwhelming. Various explanations for
this phenomenon have been given, ranging from experiential and sociocultural
differences in pain experience between men and women to hormonally and
genetically driven sex differences in brain neurochemistry.

Down syndrome is the most common form of intellectual disability and results from
one of the most complex genetic perturbations that is compatible with survival,
trisomy 21. The study of brain dysfunction in this disorder has largely been
based on a gene discovery approach, but we are now moving into an era of
functional genome exploration, in which the effects of individual genes are being
studied alongside the effects of deregulated non-coding genetic elements and
epigenetic influences. Also, new data from functional neuroimaging studies are
challenging our views of the cognitive phenotypes associated with Down syndrome
and their pathophysiological correlates. These advances hold promise for the
development of treatments for intellectual disability.

Genetic and environmental factors control morphological and functional
differences between the two sides of the nervous system. Neural asymmetries are
proposed to have important roles in circuit physiology, cognition and
species-specific behaviours. We propose two fundamentally different mechanisms
for encoding left-right asymmetry in neural circuits. In the first, asymmetric
circuits share common components; in the second, there are unique unilateral
structures. Research in both vertebrates and invertebrates is helping to reveal
the mechanisms underlying the development of neural lateralization, but less is
known about the function of circuit asymmetries. Technical advances in the coming
years are likely to revolutionize our understanding of left-right asymmetry in
the nervous system.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors oligodendrocyte transcription
factor 1 (OLIG1) and OLIG2 are structurally similar and, to a first
approximation, coordinately expressed in the developing CNS and postnatal brain. 
Despite these similarities, it was apparent from early on after their discovery
that OLIG1 and OLIG2 have non-overlapping developmental functions in patterning, 
neuron subtype specification and the formation of oligodendrocytes. Here, we
summarize more recent insights into the separate roles of these transcription
factors in the postnatal brain during repair processes and in neurological
disease states, including multiple sclerosis and malignant glioma. We discuss how
the unique functions of OLIG1 and OLIG2 may reflect their distinct genetic
targets, co-regulator proteins and/or post-translational modifications.

Thirty years have passed since the publication of Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper
and Paul Munro's 'Theory for the development of neuron selectivity: orientation
specificity and binocular interaction in visual cortex', known as the BCM theory 
of synaptic plasticity. This theory has guided experimentalists to discover some 
fundamental properties of synaptic plasticity and has provided a mathematical
structure that bridges molecular mechanisms and systems-level consequences of
learning and memory storage.

Honeybees contradict the notion that insect behaviour tends to be relatively
inflexible and stereotypical. Indeed, they live in colonies and exhibit complex
social, navigational and communication behaviours, as well as a relatively rich
cognitive repertoire. Because these relatively complex behaviours are controlled 
by a brain consisting of only 1 million or so neurons, honeybees offer an
opportunity to study the relationship between behaviour and cognition in neural
networks that are limited in size and complexity. Most recently, the honeybee has
been used to model learning and memory formation, highlighting its utility for
neuroscience research, in particular for understanding the basis of cognition.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the only major mental disorder for which
a cause is considered to be known: that is, an event that involves threat to the 
physical integrity of oneself or others and induces a response of intense fear,
helplessness or horror. Although PTSD is still largely regarded as a
psychological phenomenon, over the past three decades the growth of the
biological PTSD literature has been explosive, and thousands of references now
exist. Ultimately, the impact of an environmental event, such as a psychological 
trauma, must be understood at organic, cellular and molecular levels. This Review
attempts to present the current state of this understanding on the basis of
psychophysiological, structural and functional neuroimaging, and
endocrinological, genetic and molecular biological studies in humans and in
animal models.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellularly acting enzymes that have
long been known to have deleterious roles in brain injury and disease. In
particular, widespread and protracted MMP activity can contribute to neuronal
loss and synaptic dysfunction. However, recent studies show that rapid and focal 
MMP-mediated proteolysis proactively drives synaptic structural and functional
remodelling that is crucial for ongoing cognitive processes. Deficits in synaptic
remodelling are associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, and
aberrant MMP expression or function may contribute to the molecular mechanisms
underlying these deficits. This Review explores the paradigm shift in our
understanding of the contribution of MMPs to normal and abnormal synaptic
plasticity and function.

The social and neural sciences share a common interest in understanding the
mechanisms that underlie human behaviour. However, interactions between
neuroscience and social science disciplines remain strikingly narrow and tenuous.
We illustrate the scope and challenges for such interactions using the
paradigmatic example of neuroeconomics. Using quantitative analyses of both its
scientific literature and the social networks in its intellectual community, we
show that neuroeconomics now reflects a true disciplinary integration, such that 
research topics and scientific communities with interdisciplinary span exert
greater influence on the field. However, our analyses also reveal key structural 
and intellectual challenges in balancing the goals of neuroscience with those of 
the social sciences. To address these challenges, we offer a set of prescriptive 
recommendations for directing future research in neuroeconomics.

Although the perirhinal cortex (PRC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and
retrosplenial cortex (RSC) have an essential role in memory, the precise
functions of these areas are poorly understood. Here, we review the anatomical
and functional characteristics of these areas based on studies in humans, monkeys
and rats. Our Review suggests that the PRC and PHC-RSC are core components of two
separate large-scale cortical networks that are dissociable by neuroanatomy,
susceptibility to disease and function. These networks not only support different
types of memory but also appear to support different aspects of cognition.

Mind-altering microorganisms: the impact of the gut microbiota on brain and

Recent years have witnessed the rise of the gut microbiota as a major topic of
research interest in biology. Studies are revealing how variations and changes in
the composition of the gut microbiota influence normal physiology and contribute 
to diseases ranging from inflammation to obesity. Accumulating data now indicate 
that the gut microbiota also communicates with the CNS--possibly through neural, 
endocrine and immune pathways--and thereby influences brain function and
behaviour. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic
bacterial infections, probiotic bacteria or antibiotic drugs suggest a role for
the gut microbiota in the regulation of anxiety, mood, cognition and pain. Thus, 
the emerging concept of a microbiota-gut-brain axis suggests that modulation of
the gut microbiota may be a tractable strategy for developing novel therapeutics 
for complex CNS disorders.

Kainate receptors are a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors whose
physiological roles differ from those of other subtypes of glutamate receptors in
that they predominantly serve as modulators, rather than mediators, of synaptic
transmission. Neuronal kainate receptors exhibit unusually slow kinetic
properties that have been difficult to reconcile with the behaviour of
recombinant kainate receptors. Recently, however, the neuropilin and tolloid-like
1 (NETO1) and NETO2 proteins were identified as auxiliary kainate receptor
subunits that shape both the biophysical properties and synaptic localization of 
these receptors.

Adult neurogenesis is often considered an archaic trait that has undergone a
'phylogenetic reduction' from amphibian ancestors to humans. However, adult
neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus might actually be a late-evolved
trait. In non-mammals, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not restricted to the
equivalents of the dentate gyrus, which also show different connectivity and
functionality compared to their mammalian counterpart. Moving actively in a
changing world and dealing with novelty and complexity regulate adult
neurogenesis. New neurons might thus provide the cognitive adaptability to
conquer ecological niches rich with challenging stimuli.

In a departure from previous top-down or bottom-up strategies used to understand 
neuronal circuits, many forward-looking research programs now place the circuit
itself at their centre. This has led to an emphasis on the dissection and
elucidation of neuronal circuit elements and mechanisms, and on studies that ask 
how these circuits generate behavioural outputs. This movement towards
circuit-centric strategies is progressing rapidly as a result of technological
advances that combine genetic manipulation with light-based methods. The core
tools of these new approaches are genetically encoded optical indicators and
actuators that enable non-destructive interrogation and manipulation of neuronal 
circuits in behaving animals with cellular-level precision. This Review examines 
genetically encoded reporters of neuronal function and assesses their value for
circuit-oriented neuroscientific investigations.

The adult mammalian brain has a remarkable capacity to learn in both the
perceptual and motor domains through the formation and consolidation of memories.
Such practice-enabled procedural learning results in perceptual and motor skill
improvements. Here, we examine evidence supporting the notion that perceptual and
motor learning in humans exhibit analogous properties, including similarities in 
temporal dynamics and the interactions between primary cortical and higher-order 
brain areas. These similarities may point to the existence of a common general
mechanism for learning in humans.

Understanding adolescence as a period of social-affective engagement and goal

Research has demonstrated that extensive structural and functional brain
development continues throughout adolescence. A popular notion emerging from this
work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could
explain adolescents' high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous
behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple
model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the
importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the 
onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities.
These changes in social-affective processing also may confer some adaptive
advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one's intrinsic motivations 
and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.

Semaphorins are key players in the control of neural circuit development. Recent 
studies have uncovered several exciting and novel aspects of neuronal semaphorin 
signalling in various cellular processes--including neuronal polarization,
topographical mapping and axon sorting--that are crucial for the assembly of
functional neuronal connections. This progress is important for further
understanding the many neuronal and non-neuronal functions of semaphorins and for
gaining insight into their emerging roles in the perturbed neural connectivity
that is observed in some diseases. This Review discusses recent advances in
semaphorin research, focusing on novel aspects of neuronal semaphorin receptor
regulation and previously unexplored cellular functions of semaphorins in the
nervous system.

Distributed synergistic plasticity and cerebellar learning.

Author information:

Netherlands.

Studies on synaptic plasticity in the context of learning have been dominated by 
the view that a single, particular type of plasticity forms the underlying
mechanism for a particular type of learning. However, emerging evidence shows
that many forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity at different sites are
induced conjunctively during procedural memory formation in the cerebellum. Here,
we review the main forms of long-term plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that
underlie motor learning. We propose that the different forms of plasticity in the
granular layer and the molecular layer operate synergistically in a temporally
and spatially distributed manner, so as to ultimately create optimal output for
behaviour.

Fear is an emotion that has powerful effects on behaviour and physiology across
animal species. It is accepted that the amygdala has a central role in processing
fear. However, it is less widely appreciated that distinct amygdala outputs and
downstream circuits are involved in different types of fear. Data show that fear 
of painful stimuli, predators and aggressive members of the same species are
processed in independent neural circuits that involve the amygdala and downstream
hypothalamic and brainstem circuits. Here, we discuss data supporting multiple
fear pathways and the implications of this distributed system for understanding
and treating fear.

Novel classes of small and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are being characterized 
at a rapid pace, driven by recent paradigm shifts in our understanding of genomic
architecture, regulation and transcriptional output, as well as by innovations in
sequencing technologies and computational and systems biology. These ncRNAs can
interact with DNA, RNA and protein molecules; engage in diverse structural,
functional and regulatory activities; and have roles in nuclear organization and 
transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic processes. This expanding
inventory of ncRNAs is implicated in mediating a broad spectrum of processes
including brain evolution, development, synaptic plasticity and disease
pathogenesis.

Calcium channel auxiliary α2δ and β subunits: trafficking and one step beyond.

The voltage-gated calcium channel α(2)δ and β subunits are traditionally
considered to be auxiliary subunits that enhance channel trafficking, increase
the expression of functional calcium channels at the plasma membrane and
influence the channels' biophysical properties. Accumulating evidence indicates
that these subunits may also have roles in the nervous system that are not
directly linked to calcium channel function. For example, β subunits may act as
transcriptional regulators, and certain α(2)δ subunits may function in
synaptogenesis. The aim of this Review is to examine both the classic and novel
roles for these auxiliary subunits in voltage-gated calcium channel function and 
beyond.

Multisensory brain mechanisms of bodily self-consciousness.

Author information:

Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. olaf.blanke@epfl.ch

Recent research has linked bodily self-consciousness to the processing and
integration of multisensory bodily signals in temporoparietal, premotor,
posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices. Studies in which subjects receive
ambiguous multisensory information about the location and appearance of their own
body have shown that these brain areas reflect the conscious experience of
identifying with the body (self-identification (also known as body-ownership)),
the experience of where 'I' am in space (self-location) and the experience of the
position from where 'I' perceive the world (first-person perspective). Along with
phenomena of altered states of self-consciousness in neurological patients and
electrophysiological data from non-human primates, these findings may form the
basis for a neurobiological model of bodily self-consciousness.

Control of central auditory processing by a brain-generated oestrogen.

Author information:

USA. pinaud@northwestern.edu

Recent discoveries show that behaviourally relevant sensory experience drives the
production of oestradiol - the classic sex steroid oestrogen - in auditory
neurons in the adult brain of both males and females. This brain-generated
oestrogen markedly enhances the efficiency of the neural coding of acoustic cues 
and shapes auditory-based behaviours on a timescale that is relevant for sensory 
processing and congruent with the action of rapid neuromodulators. These findings
are re-shaping our current understanding of the mechanistic framework that
supports sensory processing and the functional roles of hormones in the brain,
and have implications for multiple health issues.

How we estimate uncertainty is important in decision neuroscience and has
wide-ranging implications in basic and clinical neuroscience, from computational 
models of optimality to ideas on psychopathological disorders including anxiety, 
depression and schizophrenia. Empirical research in neuroscience, which has been 
based on divergent theoretical assumptions, has focused on the fundamental
question of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain and how it influences
behaviour. Here, we integrate several theoretical concepts about uncertainty into
a decision-making framework. We conclude that the currently available evidence
indicates that distinct neural encoding (including summary statistic-type
representations) of uncertainty occurs in distinct neural systems.

Concept cells: the building blocks of declarative memory functions.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, UK. rqqg1@le.ac.uk

Intracranial recordings in subjects suffering from intractable epilepsy - made
during their evaluation for an eventual surgical removal of the epileptic focus -
have allowed the extraordinary opportunity to study the firing of multiple single
neurons in awake and behaving human subjects. These studies have shown that
neurons in the human medial temporal lobe respond in a remarkably selective and
abstract manner to particular persons or objects, such as Jennifer Aniston, Luke 
Skywalker or the Tower of Pisa. These neurons have been named 'Jennifer Aniston
neurons' or, more recently, 'concept cells'. I argue that the sparse, explicit
and abstract representation of these neurons is crucial for memory functions,
such as the creation of associations and the transition between related concepts 
that leads to episodic memories and the flow of consciousness.

Kynurenines in the mammalian brain: when physiology meets pathology.

The essential amino acid tryptophan is not only a precursor of serotonin but is
also degraded to several other neuroactive compounds, including kynurenic acid,
3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid. The synthesis of these metabolites is
regulated by an enzymatic cascade, known as the kynurenine pathway, that is
tightly controlled by the immune system. Dysregulation of this pathway, resulting
in hyper-or hypofunction of active metabolites, is associated with
neurodegenerative and other neurological disorders, as well as with psychiatric
diseases such as depression and schizophrenia. With recently developed
pharmacological agents, it is now possible to restore metabolic equilibrium and
envisage novel therapeutic interventions.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an autoimmune, inflammatory disease
of the CNS. In most patients, the disease follows a relapsing-remitting course
and is characterized by dynamic inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the CNS.
Although on the surface MS may appear consistent with a primary autoimmune
disease, questions have been raised as to whether inflammation and/or
autoimmunity are really at the root of the disease, and it has been proposed that
MS might in fact be a degenerative disorder. We argue that MS may be an
'immunological convolution' between an underlying primary degenerative disorder
and the host's aberrant immune response. To better understand this disease, we
might need to consider non-inflammatory primary progressive MS as the 'real' MS, 
with inflammatory forms reflecting secondary, albeit very important, reactions.

The availability of neuroimaging technology has spurred a marked increase in the 
human cognitive neuroscience literature, including the study of cognitive ageing.
Although there is a growing consensus that the ageing brain retains considerable 
plasticity of function, currently measured primarily by means of functional MRI, 
it is less clear how age differences in brain activity relate to cognitive
performance. The field is also hampered by the complexity of the ageing process
itself and the large number of factors that are influenced by age. In this
Review, current trends and unresolved issues in the cognitive neuroscience of
ageing are discussed.

Recent studies have provided long-sought evidence that behavioural learning
involves specific synapse gain and elimination processes, which lead to memory
traces that influence behaviour. The connectivity rearrangements are preceded by 
enhanced synapse turnover, which can be modulated through changes in inhibitory
connectivity. Behaviourally related synapse rearrangement events tend to co-occur
spatially within short stretches of dendrites, and involve signalling pathways
partially overlapping with those controlling the functional plasticity of
synapses. The new findings suggest that a mechanistic understanding of learning
and memory processes will require monitoring ensembles of synapses in situ and
the development of synaptic network models that combine changes in synaptic
function and connectivity.

Over the past five years the field of neurogenetics has yielded a wealth of data 
that have facilitated a much greater understanding of the aetiology of many
neurological diseases. Most of these advances are a result of improvements in
technology that have allowed us to determine whole-genome structure and variation
and to examine its impact on phenotype in an unprecedented manner. Genome-wide
association studies have provided information on how common genetic variability
imparts risk for the development of various complex diseases. Moreover, the
identification of rare disease-causing mutations have led to the discovery of
novel biochemical pathways that are involved in disease pathogensis. Here, we
review these advances and discuss how they have changed the approaches being used
to study neurological disorders.

Neuronal activity in the brain gives rise to transmembrane currents that can be
measured in the extracellular medium. Although the major contributor of the
extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other
sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and
ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially
shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in
animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed 
data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the
cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking 
output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to
the extracellular signal.

Apoptotic and non-apoptotic roles of caspases in neuronal physiology and

Caspases are cysteine proteases that mediate apoptosis, which is a form of
regulated cell death that effectively and efficiently removes extra and
unnecessary cells during development. In the mature nervous system, caspases are 
not only involved in mediating cell death but also regulatory events that are
important for neural functions, such as axon pruning and synapse elimination,
which are necessary to refine mature neuronal circuits. Furthermore, caspases can
be reactivated to cause cell death as well as non-lethal changes in neurons
during numerous pathological processes. Thus, although a global activation of
caspases leads to apoptosis, restricted and localized activation may control
normal physiology and pathophysiology in living neurons. This Review explores the
multiple roles of caspase activity in neurons.

GABA(B) receptors (GABA(B)Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors for GABA, the main 
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. In the past 5 years, notable advances
have been made in our understanding of the molecular composition of these
receptors. GABA(B)Rs are now known to comprise principal and auxiliary subunits
that influence receptor properties in distinct ways. The principal subunits
regulate the surface expression and the axonal versus dendritic distribution of
these receptors, whereas the auxiliary subunits determine agonist potency and the
kinetics of the receptor response. This Review summarizes current knowledge on
how the subunit composition of GABA(B)Rs affects the distribution of these
receptors, neuronal processes and higher brain functions.

In recent years, novel model systems have made significant contributions to our
understanding of the processes that control the ageing of whole organisms.
However, there are limited data to show that the mechanisms that gerontologists
have identified as having a role in organismal ageing contribute significantly to
the ageing of the central nervous system. Two recent discoveries illustrate this 
particularly well. The first is the consistent failure of researchers to
demonstrate a simple relationship between organismal ageing and oxidative
stress--a mechanism often assumed to have a primary role in brain ageing. The
second is the demonstration that senescent cells play a causal part in organismal
ageing but remain essentially unstudied in a CNS context. We argue that the
animal models now available (including rodents, flies, molluscs and worms), if
properly applied, will allow a paradigm shift in our current understanding of the
normal processes of brain ageing.

Deep molecular diversity of mammalian synapses: why it matters and how to measure

Pioneering studies in the middle of the twentieth century revealed substantial
diversity among mammalian chemical synapses and led to a widely accepted
classification of synapse type on the basis of neurotransmitter molecule
identity. Subsequently, powerful new physiological, genetic and structural
methods have enabled the discovery of much deeper functional and molecular
diversity within each traditional neurotransmitter type. Today, this deep
diversity continues to pose both daunting challenges and exciting new
opportunities for neuroscience. Our growing understanding of deep synapse
diversity may transform how we think about and study neural circuit development, 
structure and function.

The pain of social disconnection: examining the shared neural underpinnings of

Experiences of social rejection, exclusion or loss are generally considered to be
some of the most 'painful' experiences that we endure. Indeed, many of us go to
great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences (such as
public speaking). Why is it that these negative social experiences have such a
profound effect on our emotional well-being? Emerging evidence suggests that
experiences of social pain--the painful feelings associated with social
disconnection--rely on some of the same neurobiological substrates that underlie 
experiences of physical pain. Understanding the ways in which physical and social
pain overlap may provide new insights into the surprising relationship between
these two types of experiences.

Major psychiatric illnesses such as mood disorders and schizophrenia are chronic,
recurrent mental illnesses that affect the lives of millions of individuals.
Although these disorders have traditionally been viewed as 'neurochemical
diseases', it is now clear that they are associated with impairments of synaptic 
plasticity and cellular resilience. Although most patients with these disorders
do not have classic mitochondrial disorders, there is a growing body of evidence 
to suggest that impaired mitochondrial function may affect key cellular
processes, thereby altering synaptic functioning and contributing to the atrophic
changes that underlie the deteriorating long-term course of these illnesses.
Enhancing mitochondrial function could represent an important avenue for the
development of novel therapeutics and also presents an opportunity for a
potentially more efficient drug-development process.

mRNAs can be targeted to specific neuronal subcellular domains, which enables
rapid changes in the local proteome through local translation. This mRNA-based
mechanism links extrinsic signals to spatially restricted cellular responses and 
can mediate stimulus-driven adaptive responses such as dendritic plasticity.
Local mRNA translation also occurs in growing axons where it can mediate
directional responses to guidance signals. Recent profiling studies have revealed
that both growing and mature axons possess surprisingly complex and dynamic
transcriptomes, thereby suggesting that axonal mRNA localization is highly
regulated and has a role in a broad range of processes, a view that is
increasingly being supported by new experimental evidence. Here, we review
current knowledge on the roles and regulatory mechanisms of axonal mRNA
translation and discuss emerging links to axon guidance, survival, regeneration
and neurological disorders.

The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its
size--relative to the size of the body--and many aspects of brain network
organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these
costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological
efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of
these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a
wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic 
trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively
valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between
multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating,
trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long
(decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and
adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric
disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain
networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.

Optogenetic tools have provided a new way to establish causal relationships
between brain activity and behaviour in health and disease. Although no animal
model captures human disease precisely, behaviours that recapitulate disease
symptoms may be elicited and modulated by optogenetic methods, including
behaviours that are relevant to anxiety, fear, depression, addiction, autism and 
parkinsonism. The rapid proliferation of optogenetic reagents together with the
swift advancement of strategies for implementation has created new opportunities 
for causal and precise dissection of the circuits underlying brain diseases in
animal models.

The many faces of insulin-like peptide signalling in the brain.

Central and peripheral insulin-like peptides (ILPs), which include insulin,
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF2, exert many effects in the brain.
Through their actions on brain growth and differentiation, ILPs contribute to
building circuitries that subserve metabolic and behavioural adaptation to
internal and external cues of energy availability. In the adult brain each ILP
has distinct effects, but together their actions ultimately regulate energy
homeostasis - they affect nutrient sensing and regulate neuronal plasticity to
modulate adaptive behaviours involved in food seeking, including high-level
cognitive operations such as spatial memory. In essence, the multifaceted
activity of ILPs in the brain may be viewed as a system organization involved in 
the control of energy allocation.

An increasingly influential perspective conceptualizes both obesity and
overeating as a food addiction accompanied by corresponding brain changes.
Because there are far-reaching implications for clinical practice and social
policy if it becomes widely accepted, a critical evaluation of this model is
important. We examine the current evidence for the link between addiction and
obesity, identifying several fundamental shortcomings in the model, as well as
weaknesses and inconsistencies in the empirical support for it from human
neuroscientific research.

The circadian clock and pathology of the ageing brain.

Ageing leads to a functional deterioration of many brain systems, including the
circadian clock--an internal time-keeping system that generates ∼24-hour rhythms 
in physiology and behaviour. Numerous clinical studies have established a direct 
correlation between abnormal circadian clock functions and the severity of
neurodegenerative and sleep disorders. Latest data from experiments in model
organisms, gene expression studies and clinical trials imply that dysfunctions of
the circadian clock contribute to ageing and age-associated pathologies, thereby 
suggesting a functional link between the circadian clock and age-associated
decline of brain functions. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying this link
include the circadian control of physiological processes such as brain
metabolism, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, hormone secretion, autophagy and
stem cell proliferation.

Normal ageing is associated with impairments in cognitive function, including
memory. These impairments are linked, not to a loss of neurons in the forebrain, 
but to specific and relatively subtle synaptic alterations in the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex. Here, we review studies that have shed light on the cellular
and synaptic changes observed in these brain structures during ageing that can be
directly related to cognitive decline in young and aged animals. We also discuss 
the influence of the hormonal status on these age-related alterations and recent 
progress in the development of therapeutic strategies to limit the impact of
ageing on memory and cognition in humans.

High-resolution, comprehensive structural information is often the final arbiter 
between competing mechanistic models of biological processes, and can serve as
inspiration for new hypotheses. In molecular biology, definitive structural data 
at atomic resolution are available for many macromolecules; however, information 
about the structure of the brain is much less complete, both in scope and
resolution. Several technical developments over the past decade, such as serial
block-face electron microscopy and trans-synaptic viral tracing, have made the
structural biology of neural circuits conceivable: we may be able to obtain the
structural information needed to reconstruct the network of cellular connections 
for large parts of, or even an entire, mouse brain within a decade or so. Given
that the brain's algorithms are ultimately encoded by this network, knowing where
all of these connections are should, at the very least, provide the data needed
to distinguish between models of neural computation.

Neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia in brain ischaemia.

Cooling can reduce primary injury and prevent secondary injury to the brain after
insults in certain clinical settings and in animal models of brain insult. The
mechanisms that underlie the protective effects of cooling - also known as
therapeutic hypothermia - are slowly beginning to be understood. Hypothermia
influences multiple aspects of brain physiology in the acute, subacute and
chronic stages of ischaemia. It affects pathways leading to excitotoxicity,
apoptosis, inflammation and free radical production, as well as blood flow,
metabolism and blood-brain barrier integrity. Hypothermia may also influence
neurogenesis, gliogenesis and angiogenesis after injury. It is likely that no
single factor can explain the neuroprotection provided by hypothermia, but
understanding its myriad effects may shed light on important neuroprotective
mechanisms.

Assembly of a new growth cone after axotomy: the precursor to axon regeneration.

Author information: 
(1)Axonal Growth and Regeneration, German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease,
Ludwig-Erhard-Allee 2, 53175 Bonn, Germany.

The assembly of a new growth cone is a prerequisite for axon regeneration after
injury. Creation of a new growth cone involves multiple processes, including
calcium signalling, restructuring of the cytoskeleton, transport of materials,
local translation of messenger RNAs and the insertion of new membrane and cell
surface molecules. In axons that have an intrinsic ability to regenerate, these
processes are executed in a timely fashion. However, in axons that lack
regenerative capacity, such as those of the mammalian CNS, several of the steps
that are required for regeneration fail, and these axons do not begin the growth 
process. Identification of the points of failure can suggest targets for
promoting regeneration.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength occurs during learning and can 
last for long periods, making it a probable mechanism for memory storage. LTP
induction results in calcium entry, which activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII subsequently translocates to the synapse,
where it binds to NMDA-type glutamate receptors and produces potentiation by
phosphorylating principal and auxiliary subunits of AMPA-type glutamate
receptors. These processes are all localized to stimulated spines and account for
the synapse-specificity of LTP. In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a
structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse.

Direction selectivity in the retina: symmetry and asymmetry in structure and

Visual information is processed in the retina to a remarkable degree before it is
transmitted to higher visual centres. Several types of retinal ganglion cells
(the output neurons of the retina) respond preferentially to image motion in a
particular direction, and each type of direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC)
is comprised of multiple subtypes with different preferred directions. The
direction selectivity of the cells is generated by diverse mechanisms operating
within microcircuits that rely on independent neuronal processing in individual
dendrites of both the DSGCs and the presynaptic neurons that innervate them.

Understanding calcium waves and sparks in central neurons.

All cells use changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) to
regulate cell signalling events. In neurons, with their elaborate dendritic and
axonal arborizations, there are clear examples of both localized and widespread
Ca(2+) signals. [Ca(2+)](i) changes that are generated by Ca(2+) entry through
voltage- and ligand-gated channels are the best characterized. In addition, the
release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores can result in increased [Ca(2+)](i); 
the signals that trigger this release have been less well-studied, in part
because they are not usually associated with specific changes in membrane
potential. However, recent experiments have revealed dramatic widespread Ca(2+)
waves and localized spark-like events, particularly in dendrites. Here we review 
emerging data on the nature of these signals and their functions.

Schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities are best understood as
spectrums of diseases that have broad sets of causes. However, it is becoming
evident that these conditions also have overlapping phenotypes and genetics,
which is suggestive of common deficits. In this context, the idea that the
disruption of inhibitory circuits might be responsible for some of the clinical
features of these disorders is gaining support. Recent studies in animal models
demonstrate that the molecular basis of such disruption is linked to specific
defects in the development and function of interneurons - the cells that are
responsible for establishing inhibitory circuits in the brain. These insights are
leading to a better understanding of the causes of schizophrenia, autism and
intellectual disabilities, and may contribute to the development of
more-effective therapeutic interventions.

For many years it has been assumed that the identity of the transmitters
expressed by neurons is stable and unchanging. Recent work, however, shows that
electrical activity can respecify neurotransmitter expression during development 
and in the mature nervous system, and an understanding is emerging of the
molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent transmitter respecification.
Changes in postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor expression accompany and match 
changes in transmitter specification, thus enabling synaptic transmission. The
functional roles of neurotransmitter respecification are beginning to be
understood and appear to involve homeostatic synaptic regulation, which in turn
influences behaviour. Activation of this novel form of plasticity by sensorimotor
stimuli may provide clinical benefits.

Successful ageing is determined in part by genetic background, but also by
experiential factors associated with lifestyle and culture. Dietary, behavioural 
and pharmacological interventions have been identified as potential means to slow
brain ageing and forestall neurodegenerative disease. Many of these interventions
recruit adaptive cellular stress responses to strengthen neuronal networks and
enhance plasticity. In this Science and Society article, we describe several
determinants of healthy and pathological brain ageing, with insights into how
these processes are accelerated or prevented. We also describe the mechanisms
underlying the neuroprotective actions of exercise and nutritional interventions,
with the goal of recruiting these molecular targets for the treatment and
prevention of neurodegenerative disease.

Cognition results from interactions among functionally specialized but widely
distributed brain regions; however, neuroscience has so far largely focused on
characterizing the function of individual brain regions and neurons therein. Here
we discuss recent studies that have instead investigated the interactions between
brain regions during cognitive processes by assessing correlations between
neuronal oscillations in different regions of the primate cerebral cortex. These 
studies have opened a new window onto the large-scale circuit mechanisms

frequency-specific neuronal correlations in large-scale cortical networks may be 
'fingerprints' of canonical neuronal computations underlying cognitive processes.

Mitochondria have a number of essential roles in neuronal function. Their complex
mobility patterns within neurons are characterized by frequent changes in
direction. Mobile mitochondria can become stationary or pause in regions that
have a high metabolic demand and can move again rapidly in response to
physiological changes. Defects in mitochondrial transport are implicated in the
pathogenesis of several major neurological disorders. Research into the
mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial transport is thus an important emerging
frontier.

Computational neuroanatomy of speech production.

Speech production has been studied predominantly from within two traditions,
psycholinguistics and motor control. These traditions have rarely interacted, and
the resulting chasm between these approaches seems to reflect a level of analysis
difference: whereas motor control is concerned with lower-level articulatory
control, psycholinguistics focuses on higher-level linguistic processing.
However, closer examination of both approaches reveals a substantial convergence 
of ideas. The goal of this article is to integrate psycholinguistic and motor
control approaches to speech production. The result of this synthesis is a
neuroanatomically grounded, hierarchical state feedback control model of speech
production.

Nanodomain coupling between Ca²⁺ channels and sensors of exocytosis at fast
mammalian synapses.

The physical distance between presynaptic Ca(2+) channels and the Ca(2+) sensors 
that trigger exocytosis of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles is a key
determinant of the signalling properties of synapses in the nervous system.
Recent functional analysis indicates that in some fast central synapses,
transmitter release is triggered by a small number of Ca(2+) channels that are
coupled to Ca(2+) sensors at the nanometre scale. Molecular analysis suggests
that this tight coupling is generated by protein-protein interactions involving
Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) sensors and various other synaptic proteins. Nanodomain
coupling has several functional advantages, as it increases the efficacy, speed
and energy efficiency of synaptic transmission.

The stressed synapse: the impact of stress and glucocorticoids on glutamate
transmission.

Mounting evidence suggests that acute and chronic stress, especially the
stress-induced release of glucocorticoids, induces changes in glutamate
neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, thereby
influencing some aspects of cognitive processing. In addition, dysfunction of
glutamatergic neurotransmission is increasingly considered to be a core feature
of stress-related mental illnesses. Recent studies have shed light on the
mechanisms by which stress and glucocorticoids affect glutamate transmission,
including effects on glutamate release, glutamate receptors and glutamate
clearance and metabolism. This new understanding provides insights into normal
brain functioning, as well as the pathophysiology and potential new treatments of
stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

Direct electrical stimulation of human cortex - the gold standard for mapping
brain functions?

Despite its clinical relevance, direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the human 
brain is surprisingly poorly understood. Although we understand several aspects
of electrical stimulation at the cellular level, surface DES evokes a complex
summation effect in a large volume of brain tissue, and the effect is difficult
to predict as it depends on many local and remote physiological and morphological
factors. The complex stimulation effects are reflected in the heterogeneity of
behavioural effects that are induced by DES, which range from evocation to
inhibition of responses - sometimes even when DES is applied at the same cortical
site. Thus, it is a misconception that DES - in contrast to other neuroscience
techniques - allows us to draw unequivocal conclusions about the role of
stimulated brain areas.

RNA-binding proteins, and in particular TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), are
central to the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases and related
neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on human tissue have implicated several
possible mechanisms of disease and experimental studies are now attempting to
determine whether TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration results from a gain or a loss 
of function of the protein. In addition, the distinct possibility of pleotropic
or combined effects - in which gains of toxic properties and losses of normal
TDP43 functions act together - needs to be considered.

There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural
computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar
operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is
normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor
that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization
was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now
thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory
modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the
representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the
encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence
in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to 
mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.

The popular press is replete with stories about the effects of video and computer
games on the brain. Sensationalist headlines claiming that video games 'damage
the brain' or 'boost brain power' do not do justice to the complexities and
limitations of the studies involved, and create a confusing overall picture about
the effects of gaming on the brain. Here, six experts in the field shed light on 
our current understanding of the positive and negative ways in which playing
video games can affect cognition and behaviour, and explain how this knowledge
can be harnessed for educational and rehabilitation purposes. As research in this
area is still in its early days, the contributors of this Viewpoint also discuss 
several issues and challenges that should be addressed to move the field forward.

Recent advances in our understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of
psychiatric disorders has blown away the diagnostic boundaries that are defined
by currently used diagnostic manuals. The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)
gene was originally discovered at the breakpoint of an inherited chromosomal
translocation, which segregates with major mental illnesses. In addition, many
biological studies have indicated a role for DISC1 in early neurodevelopment and 
synaptic regulation. Given that DISC1 is thought to drive a range of
endophenotypes that underlie major mental conditions, elucidating the biology of 
DISC1 may enable the construction of new diagnostic categories for mental
illnesses with a more meaningful biological foundation.

The neurovascular unit (NVU) comprises brain endothelial cells, pericytes or
vascular smooth muscle cells, glia and neurons. The NVU controls blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical
composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of
neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated
with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within
brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together,
these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal
degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in
neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights
therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.

Virtual reality (VR) environments are increasingly being used by neuroscientists 
to simulate natural events and social interactions. VR creates interactive,
multimodal sensory stimuli that offer unique advantages over other approaches to 
neuroscientific research and applications. VR's compatibility with imaging
technologies such as functional MRI allows researchers to present multimodal
stimuli with a high degree of ecological validity and control while recording
changes in brain activity. Therapists, too, stand to gain from progress in VR
technology, which provides a high degree of control over the therapeutic
experience. Here we review the latest advances in VR technology and its
applications in neuroscience research.

The exploits of Martina Navratilova and Roger Federer represent the pinnacle of
motor learning. However, when considering the range and complexity of the
processes that are involved in motor learning, even the mere mortals among us
exhibit abilities that are impressive. We exercise these abilities when taking up
new activities - whether it is snowboarding or ballroom dancing - but also engage
in substantial motor learning on a daily basis as we adapt to changes in our
environment, manipulate new objects and refine existing skills. Here we review
recent research in human motor learning with an emphasis on the computational
mechanisms that are involved.

Addictive disorders are partly heritable, chronic, relapsing conditions that
account for a tremendous disease burden. Currently available addiction
pharmacotherapies are only moderately successful, continue to be viewed with
considerable scepticism outside the scientific community and have not become
widely adopted as treatments. More effective medical treatments are needed to
transform addiction treatment and address currently unmet medical needs. Emerging
evidence from alcoholism research suggests that no single advance can be expected
to fundamentally change treatment outcomes. Rather, studies of opioid,
corticotropin-releasing factor, GABA and serotonin systems suggest that
incremental advances in treatment outcomes will result from an improved
understanding of the genetic heterogeneity among patients with alcohol addiction,
and the development of personalized treatments.

Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex in addiction: neuroimaging findings and

The loss of control over drug intake that occurs in addiction was initially
believed to result from disruption of subcortical reward circuits. However,
imaging studies in addictive behaviours have identified a key involvement of the 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) both through its regulation of limbic reward regions and 
its involvement in higher-order executive function (for example, self-control,
salience attribution and awareness). This Review focuses on functional
neuroimaging studies conducted in the past decade that have expanded our
understanding of the involvement of the PFC in drug addiction. Disruption of the 
PFC in addiction underlies not only compulsive drug taking but also accounts for 
the disadvantageous behaviours that are associated with addiction and the erosion
of free will.

The hedonic properties of food can stimulate feeding behaviour even when energy
requirements have been met, contributing to weight gain and obesity. Similarly,
the hedonic effects of drugs of abuse can motivate their excessive intake,
culminating in addiction. Common brain substrates regulate the hedonic properties
of palatable food and addictive drugs, and recent reports suggest that excessive 
consumption of food or drugs of abuse induces similar neuroadaptive responses in 
brain reward circuitries. Here, we review evidence suggesting that obesity and
drug addiction may share common molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms.

Investigations of long-term changes in brain structure and function that
accompany chronic exposure to drugs of abuse suggest that alterations in gene
regulation contribute substantially to the addictive phenotype. Here, we review
multiple mechanisms by which drugs alter the transcriptional potential of genes. 
These mechanisms range from the mobilization or repression of the transcriptional
machinery - including the transcription factors ΔFOSB, cyclic AMP-responsive
element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) - to epigenetics -
including alterations in the accessibility of genes within their native chromatin
structure induced by histone tail modifications and DNA methylation, and the
regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs. Increasing evidence implicates 
these various mechanisms of gene regulation in the lasting changes that drugs of 
abuse induce in the brain, and offers novel inroads for addiction therapy.

Opiate versus psychostimulant addiction: the differences do matter.

The publication of the psychomotor stimulant theory of addiction in 1987 and the 
finding that addictive drugs increase dopamine concentrations in the rat
mesolimbic system in 1988 have led to a predominance of psychobiological theories
that consider addiction to opiates and addiction to psychostimulants as
essentially identical phenomena. Indeed, current theories of addiction - hedonic 
allostasis, incentive sensitization, aberrant learning and frontostriatal
dysfunction - all argue for a unitary account of drug addiction. This view is
challenged by behavioural, cognitive and neurobiological findings in laboratory
animals and humans. Here, we argue that opiate addiction and psychostimulant
addiction are behaviourally and neurobiologically distinct and that the
differences have important implications for addiction treatment, addiction
theories and future research.

There is widespread hope that the discovery of valid biomarkers for autism will
both reveal the causes of autism and enable earlier and more targeted methods for
diagnosis and intervention. However, growing enthusiasm about recent advances in 
this area of autism research needs to be tempered by an awareness of the major
scientific challenges and the important social and ethical concerns arising from 
the development of biomarkers and their clinical application. Collaborative
approaches involving scientists and other stakeholders must combine the search
for valid, clinically useful autism biomarkers with efforts to ensure that
individuals with autism and their families are treated with respect and
understanding.

Diencephalic and brainstem mechanisms in migraine.

Francisco, California 94115, USA.

Migraine is a common and complex brain disorder. Although it is clear that head
pain is a key manifestation of the disorder for most patients, what drives the
activation of neuronal pain pathways in susceptible patients is less obvious.
There is growing evidence that migraine pathophysiology may, in part, include
dysfunction of subcortical structures. These include diencephalic and brainstem
nuclei that can modulate the perception of activation of the trigeminovascular
system, which carries sensory information from the cranial vasculature to the
brain. Dysfunction of these nuclei, and their connections to other key brain
centres, may contribute to the cascade of events that results in other symptoms
of migraine - such as light and sound sensitivity - thus providing a
comprehensive explanation of the neurobiology of the disorder.

The hippocampal formation has been implicated in a growing number of disorders,
from Alzheimer's disease and cognitive ageing to schizophrenia and depression.
How can the hippocampal formation, a complex circuit that spans the temporal
lobes, be involved in a range of such phenotypically diverse and mechanistically 
distinct disorders? Recent neuroimaging findings indicate that these disorders
differentially target distinct subregions of the hippocampal circuit. In
addition, some disorders are associated with hippocampal hypometabolism, whereas 
others show evidence of hypermetabolism. Interpreted in the context of the
functional and molecular organization of the hippocampal circuit, these
observations give rise to a unified pathophysiological framework of hippocampal
dysfunction.

Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function as part of a central timing
circuit that drives daily changes in our behaviour and underlying physiology. A
hallmark feature of SCN neuronal populations is that they are mostly electrically
silent during the night, start to fire action potentials near dawn and then
continue to generate action potentials with a slow and steady pace all day long. 
Sets of currents are responsible for this daily rhythm, with the strongest
evidence for persistent Na(+) currents, L-type Ca(2+) currents,
hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(H)), large-conductance Ca(2+) activated
K(+) (BK) currents and fast delayed rectifier (FDR) K(+) currents. These rhythms 
in electrical activity are crucial for the function of the circadian timing
system, including the expression of clock genes, and decline with ageing and
disease. This article reviews our current understanding of the ionic and
molecular mechanisms that drive the rhythmic firing patterns in the SCN.

The neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are
evolutionarily highly conserved mediators in the regulation of complex social
cognition and behaviour. Recent studies have investigated the effects of OXT and 
AVP on human social interaction, the genetic mechanisms of inter-individual
variation in social neuropeptide signalling and the actions of OXT and AVP in the
human brain as revealed by neuroimaging. These data have advanced our
understanding of the mechanisms by which these neuropeptides contribute to human 
social behaviour. OXT and AVP are emerging as targets for novel treatment
approaches--particularly in synergistic combination with psychotherapy--for
mental disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as autism, social
anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia.

The brain continuously adapts its processing machinery to behavioural demands. To
achieve this, it rapidly modulates the operating mode of cortical circuits,
controlling the way that information is transformed and routed. This article will
focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information
processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical
processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes 
involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking
correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that
selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that
operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise
non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.

Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumour and are often fast
growing with a poor prognosis for the patient. Their complex cellular
composition, diffuse invasiveness and capacity to escape therapies has challenged
researchers for decades and hampered progress towards an effective treatment.
Recent molecular characterization of tumour cells combined with new insights into
cellular diversification that occurs during development, and the modelling of
these processes in transgenic animals have enabled a more detailed understanding 
of the events that underlie gliomagenesis. Combining this enhanced understanding 
of the relationship between neural stem cell biology and the cell lineage
relationships of tumour cells with model systems offers new opportunities to
develop specific and effective therapies.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating illness that affects many
people. It has been marred by controversy, from initial scepticism in the medical
community about the existence of the condition itself to continuing
disagreements--mainly between some patient advocacy groups on one side, and
researchers and physicians on the other--about the name for the illness, its
aetiology, its pathophysiology and the effectiveness of the few currently
available treatments. The role of the CNS in the disease is central in many of
these discussions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked four scientists involved in 
CFS research about their views on the condition, its causes and the future of
research aimed at improving our understanding of this chronic illness.

is able to provide neuroprotection in several experimental models of
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. In addition, rapamycin
exerts strong anti-ageing effects in several species, including mammals. By
inhibiting the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), rapamycin
influences a variety of essential cellular processes, such as cell growth and
proliferation, protein synthesis and autophagy. Here, we review the molecular
mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of rapamycin and discuss the
therapeutic potential of this compound for neurodegenerative diseases.

The concept that the gut and the brain are closely connected, and that this
interaction plays an important part not only in gastrointestinal function but
also in certain feeling states and in intuitive decision making, is deeply rooted
in our language. Recent neurobiological insights into this gut-brain crosstalk
have revealed a complex, bidirectional communication system that not only ensures
the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal homeostasis and digestion but is
likely to have multiple effects on affect, motivation and higher cognitive
functions, including intuitive decision making. Moreover, disturbances of this
system have been implicated in a wide range of disorders, including functional
and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, obesity and eating disorders.

Neural mechanisms of the cognitive model of depression.

In the 40 years since Aaron Beck first proposed his cognitive model of
depression, the elements of this model--biased attention, biased processing,
biased thoughts and rumination, biased memory, and dysfunctional attitudes and
schemas--have been consistently linked with the onset and maintenance of
depression. Although numerous studies have examined the neural mechanisms that
underlie the cognitive aspects of depression, their findings have not been
integrated with Beck's cognitive model. In this Review, we identify the
functional and structural neurobiological architecture of Beck's cognitive model 
of depression. Although the mechanisms underlying each element of the model
differ, in general the negative cognitive biases in depression are facilitated by
increased influence from subcortical emotion processing regions combined with
attenuated top-down cognitive control.

Although typically assumed to degrade performance, random fluctuations, or noise,
can sometimes improve information processing in non-linear systems. One such form
of 'stochastic facilitation', stochastic resonance, has been observed to enhance 
processing both in theoretical models of neural systems and in experimental
neuroscience. However, the two approaches have yet to be fully reconciled.
Understanding the diverse roles of noise in neural computation will require the
design of experiments based on new theory and models, into which biologically
appropriate experimental detail feeds back at various levels of abstraction.

From the stochasticity of molecular processes to the variability of synaptic

The variability of the postsynaptic response following a single action potential 
arises from two sources: the neurotransmitter release is probabilistic, and the
postsynaptic response to neurotransmitter release has variable timing and
amplitude. At individual synapses, the number of molecules of a given type that
are involved in these processes is small enough that the stochastic (random)
properties of molecular events cannot be neglected. How the stochasticity of
molecular processes contributes to the variability of synaptic transmission, its 
sensitivity and its robustness to molecular fluctuations has important
implications for our understanding of the mechanistic basis of synaptic
transmission and of synaptic plasticity.

Macrophages from the peripheral circulation and those derived from resident
microglia are among the main effector cells of the inflammatory response that
follows spinal cord trauma. There has been considerable debate in the field as to
whether the inflammatory response is good or bad for tissue protection and
repair. Recent studies on macrophage polarization in non-neural tissues have shed
much light on their changing functional states. In the context of this
literature, we discuss the activation of macrophages and microglia following
spinal cord injury, and their effects on repair. Harnessing their
anti-inflammatory properties could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies
for spinal cord trauma.

The subjective effects of intravenous cocaine are felt almost immediately, and
this immediacy plays an important part in the drug's rewarding impact. The
primary rewarding effect of cocaine involves blockade of dopamine reuptake;
however, the onset of this action is too late to account for the drug's initial
effects. Recent studies suggest that cocaine-predictive cues--including
peripheral interoceptive cues generated by cocaine itself--come to cause more
direct and earlier reward signalling by activating excitatory inputs to the
dopamine system. The conditioned activation of the dopamine system by
cocaine-predictive cues offers a new target for potential addiction therapies.

Cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol-related aggression.

Alcohol-related violence is a serious and common social problem. Moreover,
violent behaviour is much more common in alcohol-dependent individuals. Animal
experiments and human studies have provided insights into the acute effect of
alcohol on aggressive behaviour and into common factors underlying acute and
chronic alcohol intake and aggression. These studies have shown that
environmental factors, such as early-life stress, interact with genetic
variations in serotonin-related genes that affect serotonergic and GABAergic
neurotransmission. This leads to increased amygdala activity and impaired
prefrontal function that, together, predispose to both increased alcohol intake
and impulsive aggression. In addition, acute and chronic alcohol intake can
further impair executive control and thereby facilitate aggressive behaviour.

Ageing as a primary risk factor for Parkinson's disease: evidence from studies of
non-human primates.

Ageing is the greatest risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease.
However, the current dogma holds that cellular mechanisms that are associated
with ageing of midbrain dopamine neurons and those that are related to dopamine
neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease are unrelated. We propose, based on
evidence from studies of non-human primates, that normal ageing and the
degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease are linked by the same
cellular mechanisms and, therefore, that markers of cellular risk factors
accumulate with age in a pattern that mimics the pattern of degeneration observed
in Parkinson's disease. We contend that ageing induces a pre-parkinsonian state, 
and that the cellular mechanisms of dopamine neuron demise during normal ageing
are accelerated or exaggerated in Parkinson's disease through a combination of
genetic and environmental factors.

The nervous system is protected by barriers that restrict the invasion of
pathogens. Nevertheless, mechanisms have evolved by which microbes can pass these
barriers, enter and exit neurons and target various regions of the nervous
system. In the brain, immune responses to pathogens are generally not robust, so 
microbes can hide and survive or, conversely, cause severe uncontrolled
infections. Depending on their sites of entry and the regions that they target,
microbes can cause diverse nervous system dysfunctions and even influence host
behaviour to their own advantage. This Review discusses routes by which microbes 
can reach the nervous system and cause persistent or life-threatening infections.

The development of the nervous system is an extremely complex and dynamic
process. Through the continuous interplay of genetic information and changing
intra- and extracellular environments, the nervous system constructs itself from 
precursor cells that divide and form neurons, which migrate, differentiate and
establish synaptic connections. Our understanding of neural development can be
greatly assisted by mathematical and computational modelling, because it allows
us to bridge the gap between system-level dynamics and the lower level cellular
and molecular processes. This Review shows the potential of theoretical models to
examine many aspects of neural development.

Spatiotemporal firing patterns in the cerebellum.

Neurons are generally considered to communicate information by increasing or
decreasing their firing rate. However, in principle, they could in addition
convey messages by using specific spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activities
and silent intervals. Here, we review expanding lines of evidence that such
spatiotemporal coding occurs in the cerebellum, and that the olivocerebellar
system is optimally designed to generate and employ precise patterns of complex
spikes and simple spikes during the acquisition and consolidation of motor
skills. These spatiotemporal patterns may complement rate coding, thus enabling
precise control of motor and cognitive processing at a high spatiotemporal
resolution by fine-tuning sensorimotor integration and coordination.

As the global financial downturn continues, its impact on neuroscientists - both 
on an individual level and at the level of their research institute - becomes
increasingly apparent. How is the economic crisis affecting neuroscience funding,
career prospects, international collaborations and scientists' morale in
different parts of the world? Nature Reviews Neuroscience gauged the opinions of 
a number of leading neuroscientists: the President of the Society for
Neuroscience, the President Elect of the British Neuroscience Association, the
former President of the Japan Neuroscience Society, the President of the
Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and the Director of the US National
Institute of Mental Health. Their responses provide interesting and important
insights into the regional impact of the global financial downturn, with some
causes for optimism for the future of neuroscience research.

The Notch pathway is often regarded as a developmental pathway, but components of
Notch signalling are expressed and active in the adult brain. With the advent of 
more sophisticated genetic manipulations, evidence has emerged that suggests both
conserved and novel roles for Notch signalling in the adult brain. Not
surprisingly, Notch is a key regulator of adult neural stem cells, but it is
increasingly clear that Notch signalling also has roles in the regulation of
migration, morphology, synaptic plasticity and survival of immature and mature
neurons. Understanding the many functions of Notch signalling in the adult brain,
and its dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and malignancy, is crucial to
the development of new therapeutics that are centred around this pathway.

Nerve cell development in the brain is a tightly regulated process. The
generation of neurons from precursor cells, their migration to the appropriate
target sites, their extensive arborization and their integration into functional 
networks through synapse formation and refinement are governed by multiple
interdependent signalling cascades. The function and turnover of proteins
involved in these signalling cascades, in turn, are spatially and temporally
controlled by ubiquitylation. Recent advances have provided first insights into
the highly complex and intricate molecular pathways that regulate ubiquitylation 
during all stages of neural development and that operate in parallel with other
regulatory processes such as phosphorylation or cyclic nucleotide signalling.

Lipid-mediated signalling regulates a plethora of physiological processes,
including crucial aspects of brain function. In addition, dysregulation of lipid 
pathways has been implicated in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders, 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although much attention has been given to the
link between cholesterol and AD pathogenesis, growing evidence suggests that
other lipids, such as phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid, have an important 
role. Regulators of lipid metabolism (for example, statins) are a highly
successful class of marketed drugs, and exploration of lipid dysregulation in AD 
and identification of novel therapeutic agents acting through relevant lipid
pathways offers new and effective options for the treatment of this devastating
disorder.

A new neural framework for visuospatial processing.

The division of cortical visual processing into distinct dorsal and ventral
streams is a key framework that has guided visual neuroscience. The
characterization of the ventral stream as a 'What' pathway is relatively
uncontroversial, but the nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear.
Originally proposed as mediating spatial perception ('Where'), more recent
accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action
('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that
consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major
projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and indirectly 
through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These three pathways 
support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial processing, including
spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation, respectively.

Recent data indicate that 'classical' neurotransmitters can also act as
co-transmitters. This notion has been strengthened by the demonstration that
three vesicular glutamate transporters (vesicular glutamate transporter 1
(VGLUT1), VGLUT2 and VGLUT3) are present in central monoamine, acetylcholine and 
GABA neurons, as well as in primarily glutamatergic neurons. Thus, intriguing
questions are raised about the morphological and functional organization of
neuronal systems endowed with such a dual signalling capacity. In addition to
glutamate co-release, vesicular synergy - a process leading to enhanced packaging
of the 'primary' transmitter - is increasingly recognized as a major property of 
the glutamatergic co-phenotype. The behavioural relevance of this co-phenotype is
presently the focus of considerable interest.

The structural basis of inter-individual differences in human behaviour and

Inter-individual variability in perception, thought and action is frequently
treated as a source of 'noise' in scientific investigations of the neural
mechanisms that underlie these processes, and discarded by averaging data from a 
group of participants. However, recent MRI studies in the human brain show that
inter-individual variability in a wide range of basic and higher cognitive
functions - including perception, motor control, memory, aspects of consciousness
and the ability to introspect - can be predicted from the local structure of grey
and white matter as assessed by voxel-based morphometry or diffusion tensor
imaging. We propose that inter-individual differences can be used as a source of 
information to link human behaviour and cognition to brain anatomy.

Graded distributions of extracellular cues guide developing axons toward their
targets. A network of second messengers - Ca(2+) and cyclic nucleotides - shapes 
cue-derived information into either attractive or repulsive signals that steer
growth cones bidirectionally. Emerging evidence suggests that such guidance
signals create a localized imbalance between exocytosis and endocytosis, which in
turn redirects membrane, adhesion and cytoskeletal components asymmetrically
across the growth cone to bias the direction of axon extension. These recent
advances allow us to propose a unifying model of how the growth cone translates
shallow gradients of environmental information into polarized activity of the
steering machinery for axon guidance.

The delivery of many potentially therapeutic and diagnostic compounds to specific
areas of the brain is restricted by brain barriers, of which the most well known 
are the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
barrier. Recent studies have shown numerous additional roles of these barriers,
including an involvement in neurodevelopment, in the control of cerebral blood
flow, and--when barrier integrity is impaired--in the pathology of many common
CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.

It has been argued that emotion, pain and cognitive control are functionally
segregated in distinct subdivisions of the cingulate cortex. However, recent
observations encourage a fundamentally different view. Imaging studies
demonstrate that negative affect, pain and cognitive control activate an
overlapping region of the dorsal cingulate--the anterior midcingulate cortex
(aMCC). Anatomical studies reveal that the aMCC constitutes a hub where
information about reinforcers can be linked to motor centres responsible for
expressing affect and executing goal-directed behaviour. Computational modelling 
and other kinds of evidence suggest that this intimacy reflects control processes
that are common to all three domains. These observations compel a reconsideration
of the dorsal cingulate's contribution to negative affect and pain.

Mechanisms that ensure robust long-term performance of synaptic transmission over
a wide range of activity are crucial for the integrity of neuronal networks, for 
processing sensory information and for the ability to learn and store memories.
Recent experiments have revealed that such robust performance requires a tight
coupling between exocytic vesicle fusion at defined release sites and endocytic
retrieval of synaptic vesicle membranes. Distinct presynaptic scaffolding
proteins are essential for fulfilling this requirement, providing either
ultrastructural coordination or acting as signalling hubs.

The somatosensory system mediates fundamental physiological functions, including 
the senses of touch, pain and proprioception. This variety of functions is
matched by a diverse array of mechanosensory neurons that respond to force in a
specific fashion. Mechanotransduction begins at the sensory nerve endings, which 
rapidly transform mechanical forces into electrical signals. Progress has been
made in establishing the functional properties of mechanoreceptors, but it has
been remarkably difficult to characterize mechanotranducer channels at the
molecular level. However, in the past few years, new functional assays have
provided insights into the basic properties and molecular identity of
mechanotransducer channels in mammalian sensory neurons. The recent
identification of novel families of proteins as mechanosensing molecules will
undoubtedly accelerate our understanding of mechanotransduction mechanisms in
mammalian somatosensation.

In recent years, studies ranging from single-unit recordings in animals to
electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies in humans have
demonstrated the pivotal role of phase synchronization in memory processes. Phase
synchronization - here referring to the synchronization of oscillatory phases
between different brain regions - supports both working memory and long-term
memory and acts by facilitating neural communication and by promoting neural
plasticity. There is evidence that processes underlying working and long-term
memory might interact in the medial temporal lobe. We propose that this is
accomplished by neural operations involving phase-phase and phase-amplitude
synchronization. A deeper understanding of how phase synchronization supports the
flexibility of and interaction between memory systems may yield new insights into
the functions of phase synchronization in general.

The stem cell potential of glia: lessons from reactive gliosis.

Astrocyte-like cells, which act as stem cells in the adult brain, reside in a few
restricted stem cell niches. However, following brain injury, glia outside these 
niches acquire or reactivate stem cell potential as part of reactive gliosis.
Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular pathways involved in this
process. A comparison of molecular pathways activated after injury with those
involved in the normal neural stem cell niches highlights strategies that could
overcome the inhibition of neurogenesis outside the stem cell niche and instruct 
parenchymal glia towards a neurogenic fate. This new view on reactive glia
therefore suggests a widespread endogenous source of cells with stem cell
potential, which might potentially be harnessed for local repair strategies.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in numerous key neurotransmitter
systems in the brain that are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). GPCRs also
directly influence the amyloid cascade through modulation of the α-, β- and
γ-secretases, proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and regulation 
of amyloid-β degradation. Additionally, amyloid-β has been shown to perturb GPCR 
function. Emerging insights into the mechanistic link between GPCRs and AD
highlight the potential of this class of receptors as a therapeutic target for
AD.

Amyloid-β and tau--a toxic pas de deux in Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloid-β and tau are the two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Although 
both amyloid-β and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to 
their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their 
possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we
review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of
amyloid-β. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions 
of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a
microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β
toxicity.

A broad body of experimental work has demonstrated that apparently spontaneous
brain activity is not random. At the level of large-scale neural systems, as
measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the
organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called 
resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical
connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three 
large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key
contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the
emerging RSNs. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state
patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations
around a stable anatomical skeleton.

Making memories last: the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis.

Redondo RL(1), Morris RG.

Author information:

Systems, The University of Edinburgh, 1 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, UK.

The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis of protein synthesis-dependent
long-term potentiation asserts that the induction of synaptic potentiation
creates only the potential for a lasting change in synaptic efficacy, but not the
commitment to such a change. Other neural activity, before or after induction,
can also determine whether persistent change occurs. Recent findings, leading us 
to revise the original hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local,
synapse-specific 'tagged' state and the expression of long-term potentiation are 
dissociable. Additional observations suggest that there are major differences in 
the mechanisms of functional and structural plasticity. These advances call for a
revised theory that incorporates the specific molecular and structural processes 
involved. Addressing the physiological relevance of previous in vitro findings,
new behavioural studies have experimentally translated the hypothesis to learning
and the consolidation of newly formed memories.

Voluntary movement is a fundamental way in which animals respond to, and interact
with, their environment. In mammals, the main CNS pathway controlling voluntary
movement is the corticospinal tract, which encompasses connections between the
cerebral motor cortex and the spinal cord. Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) 
are a group of genetic disorders that lead to a length-dependent, distal
axonopathy of fibres of the corticospinal tract, causing lower limb spasticity
and weakness. Recent work aimed at elucidating the molecular cell biology
underlying the HSPs has revealed the importance of basic cellular processes —
especially membrane trafficking and organelle morphogenesis and distribution— in 
axonal maintenance and degeneration.

Most of the molecular mechanisms contributing to long-term memory have been found
to consolidate information within a brief time window after learning, but not to 
maintain information during memory storage. However, with the discovery that
synaptic long-term potentiation is maintained by the persistently active protein 
kinase, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a possible mechanism of memory storage has been
identified. Recent research shows how PKMζ might perpetuate information both at
synapses and during long-term memory.

Parkinson's disease, like many common age-related conditions, is now recognized
to have a substantial genetic component. Here, I discuss how mutations in a large
complex gene--leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)--affect protein function, and 
I review recent evidence that LRRK2 mutations affect pathways that involve other 
proteins that have been implicated in Parkinson's disease, specifically
α-synuclein and tau. These concepts can be used to understand disease processes
and to develop therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of Parkinson's
disease.

Neurons in the spinal dorsal horn process sensory information, which is then
transmitted to several brain regions, including those responsible for pain
perception. The dorsal horn provides numerous potential targets for the
development of novel analgesics and is thought to undergo changes that contribute
to the exaggerated pain felt after nerve injury and inflammation. Despite its
obvious importance, we still know little about the neuronal circuits that process
sensory information, mainly because of the heterogeneity of the various neuronal 
components that make up these circuits. Recent studies have begun to shed light
on the neuronal organization and circuitry of this complex region.

The membrane protein Nogo-A was initially characterized as a CNS-specific
inhibitor of axonal regeneration. Recent studies have uncovered regulatory roles 
of Nogo proteins and their receptors--in precursor migration, neurite growth and 
branching in the developing nervous system--as well as a growth-restricting
function during CNS maturation. The function of Nogo in the adult CNS is now
understood to be that of a negative regulator of neuronal growth, leading to
stabilization of the CNS wiring at the expense of extensive plastic
rearrangements and regeneration after injury. In addition, Nogo proteins interact
with various intracellular components and may have roles in the regulation of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, processing of amyloid precursor protein and
cell survival.

Sensory synapses of the visual and auditory systems must faithfully encode a wide
dynamic range of graded signals, and must be capable of sustained transmitter
release over long periods of time. Functionally and morphologically, these
sensory synapses are unique: their active zones are specialized in several ways
for sustained, rapid vesicle exocytosis, but their most striking feature is an
organelle called the synaptic ribbon, which is a proteinaceous structure that
extends into the cytoplasm at the active zone and tethers a large pool of
releasable vesicles. But precisely how does the ribbon function to support tonic 
release at these synapses? Recent genetic and biophysical advances have begun to 
open the 'black box' of the synaptic ribbon with some surprising findings and
promise to resolve its function in vision and hearing.

amygdala is commonly assumed to mediate the non-conscious processing of affective
visual stimuli. We review anatomical and physiological data that argue against
the notion that such a pathway plays a prominent part in processing affective
visual stimuli in humans. Instead, we propose that the primary role of the
amygdala in visual processing, like that of the pulvinar, is to coordinate the
function of cortical networks during evaluation of the biological significance of
affective visual stimuli. Under this revised framework, the cortex has a more
important role in emotion processing than is traditionally assumed.

Vocal imitation in human infants and in some orders of birds relies on
auditory-guided motor learning during a sensitive period of development. It
proceeds from 'babbling' (in humans) and 'subsong' (in birds) through distinct
phases towards the full-fledged communication system. Language development and
birdsong learning have parallels at the behavioural, neural and genetic levels.
Different orders of birds have evolved networks of brain regions for song
learning and production that have a surprisingly similar gross anatomy, with
analogies to human cortical regions and basal ganglia. Comparisons between
different songbird species and humans point towards both general and
species-specific principles of vocal learning and have identified common neural
and molecular substrates, including the forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) gene.

The dual role of the extracellular matrix in synaptic plasticity and homeostasis.

Recent studies have deepened our understanding of multiple mechanisms by which
extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules regulate various aspects of synaptic
plasticity and have strengthened a link between the ECM and learning and memory. 
New findings also support the view that the ECM is important for homeostatic
processes, such as scaling of synaptic responses, metaplasticity and
stabilization of synaptic connectivity. Activity-dependent modification of the
ECM affects the formation of dendritic filopodia and the growth of dendritic
spines. Thus, the ECM has a dual role as a promoter of structural and functional 
plasticity and as a degradable stabilizer of neural microcircuits. Both of these 
aspects are likely to be important for mental health.

Goal-directed and habitual control in the basal ganglia: implications for
Parkinson's disease.

Progressive loss of the ascending dopaminergic projection in the basal ganglia is
a fundamental pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Studies in animals and
humans have identified spatially segregated functional territories in the basal
ganglia for the control of goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with
Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior
putamen, a region of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual
behaviour. These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on 
the goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively
preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their
behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control owing to 
distorting output signals from habitual control circuits, which impede the
expression of goal-directed action.

To celebrate the first 10 years of Nature Reviews Neuroscience, we invited the
authors of the most cited article of each year to look back on the state of their
field of research at the time of publication and the impact their article has
had, and to discuss the questions that might be answered in the next 10 years.
This selection of highly cited articles provides interesting snapshots of the
progress that has been made in diverse areas of neuroscience. They show the
enormous influence of neuroimaging techniques and highlight concepts that have
generated substantial interest in the past decade, such as neuroimmunology,
social neuroscience and the 'network approach' to brain function. These
advancements will pave the way for further exciting discoveries that lie ahead.

The crucial role of pulsatile activity of the HPA axis for continuous dynamic

The classical concept of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) homeostasis
comprises a feedback system within which circulating levels of glucocorticoid
hormones maintain the brain and body in an optimal steady state. However, studies
involving new techniques for investigating the real-time dynamics of both
glucocorticoid hormones and glucocorticoid receptor function paint a different
picture--namely, of continuous dynamic equilibration throughout this
neuroendocrine system. This dynamic state is dictated by feedforward and feedback
regulatory loops and by stochastic interactions at the level of DNA binding. We
propose that this continuous oscillatory activity is crucial for optimal
responsiveness of glucocorticoid-sensitive neural processes.

There is a long-standing paradox that NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors
(NMDARs) can both promote neuronal health and kill neurons. Recent studies show
that NMDAR-induced responses depend on the receptor location: stimulation of
synaptic NMDARs, acting primarily through nuclear Ca(2+) signalling, leads to the
build-up of a neuroprotective 'shield', whereas stimulation of extrasynaptic
NMDARs promotes cell death. These differences result from the activation of
distinct genomic programmes and from opposing actions on intracellular signalling
pathways. Perturbations in the balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR
activity contribute to neuronal dysfunction in acute ischaemia and Huntington's
disease, and could be a common theme in the aetiology of neurodegenerative
diseases. Neuroprotective therapies should aim to both enhance the effect of
synaptic activity and disrupt extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent death signalling.

The acquisition and consolidation of memories of stressful events is modulated by
glucocorticoids, a type of corticosteroid hormone that is released in high levels
from the adrenal glands after exposure to a stressful event. These effects occur 
through activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid
receptors (GRs). The molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of
glucocorticoids on synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, learning and
memory have recently begun to be identified. Glucocorticoids regulate AMPA
(α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate) receptor trafficking--which 
is crucially involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity--both rapidly and
persistently. Stress hormones may, through modulation of AMPA receptor function, 
promote the consolidation of behaviourally relevant information.

Many emotional stimuli are processed without being consciously perceived. Recent 
evidence indicates that subcortical structures have a substantial role in this
processing. These structures are part of a phylogenetically ancient pathway that 
has specific functional properties and that interacts with cortical processes.
There is now increasing evidence that non-consciously perceived emotional stimuli
induce distinct neurophysiological changes and influence behaviour towards the
consciously perceived world. Understanding the neural bases of the non-conscious 
perception of emotional signals will clarify the phylogenetic continuity of
emotion systems across species and the integration of cortical and subcortical
activity in the human brain.

Human brain development occurs within a socioeconomic context and childhood
socioeconomic status (SES) influences neural development--particularly of the
systems that subserve language and executive function. Research in humans and in 
animal models has implicated prenatal factors, parent-child interactions and
cognitive stimulation in the home environment in the effects of SES on neural
development. These findings provide a unique opportunity for understanding how
environmental factors can lead to individual differences in brain development,
and for improving the programmes and policies that are designed to alleviate
SES-related disparities in mental health and academic achievement.

The brain is a highly modular structure. To exploit modularity, it is necessary
that spiking activity can propagate from one module to another while preserving
the information it carries. Therefore, reliable propagation is one of the key
properties of a candidate neural code. Surprisingly, the conditions under which
spiking activity can be propagated have received comparatively little attention
in the experimental literature. By contrast, several computational studies in the
last decade have addressed this issue. Using feedforward networks (FFNs) as a
generic network model, they have identified two dynamical activity modes that
support the propagation of either asynchronous (rate code) or synchronous
(temporal code) spiking. Here, we review the dichotomy of asynchronous and
synchronous propagation in FFNs, propose their integration into a single extended
conceptual framework and suggest experimental strategies to test our hypothesis.

of Psychiatry, Zurich, Switzerland. vollen@bli.uzh.ch

After a pause of nearly 40 years in research into the effects of psychedelic
drugs, recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychedelics, 
such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and ketamine have led to
renewed interest in the clinical potential of psychedelics in the treatment of
various psychiatric disorders. Recent behavioural and neuroimaging data show that
psychedelics modulate neural circuits that have been implicated in mood and
affective disorders, and can reduce the clinical symptoms of these disorders.
These findings raise the possibility that research into psychedelics might
identify novel therapeutic mechanisms and approaches that are based on
glutamate-driven neuroplasticity.

The stimulus complexity of naturally occurring odours presents unique challenges 
for central nervous systems that are aiming to internalize the external olfactory
landscape. One mechanism by which the brain encodes perceptual representations of
behaviourally relevant smells is through the synthesis of different olfactory
inputs into a unified perceptual experience--an odour object. Recent evidence
indicates that the identification, categorization and discrimination of olfactory
stimuli rely on the formation and modulation of odour objects in the piriform
cortex. Convergent findings from human and rodent models suggest that distributed
piriform ensemble patterns of olfactory qualities and categories are crucial for 
maintaining the perceptual constancy of ecologically inconstant stimuli.

Music training for the development of auditory skills.

The effects of music training in relation to brain plasticity have caused
excitement, evident from the popularity of books on this topic among scientists
and the general public. Neuroscience research has shown that music training leads
to changes throughout the auditory system that prime musicians for listening
challenges beyond music processing. This effect of music training suggests that, 
akin to physical exercise and its impact on body fitness, music is a resource
that tones the brain for auditory fitness. Therefore, the role of music in
shaping individual development deserves consideration.

There has been considerable progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that
contribute to memory formation and the generation of circadian rhythms. However, 
it is not well understood how these two processes interact to generate long-term 
memory. Recent studies in both vertebrate and invertebrate models have shown
time-of-day effects on neurophysiology and memory formation, and have revealed a 
possible role for cycling molecules in memory persistence. Together, these
studies suggest that common mechanisms underlie circadian rhythmicity and
long-term memory formation.

In the developing vertebrate retina, diverse neuronal subtypes originate from
multipotent progenitors in a conserved order and are integrated into an intricate
laminated architecture. Recent progress in mammalian photoreceptor development
has identified a complex relationship between six key transcription-regulatory
factors (RORbeta, OTX2, NRL, CRX, NR2E3 and TRbeta2) that determine rod versus M 
cone or S cone cell fate. We propose a step-wise 'transcriptional dominance'
model of photoreceptor cell fate determination, with the S cone representing the 
default state of a generic photoreceptor precursor. Elucidation of
gene-regulatory networks that dictate photoreceptor genesis and homeostasis will 
have wider implications for understanding the development of nervous system
function and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

GSK3 signalling in neural development.

Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.

Recent evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins and
their upstream and downstream regulators have key roles in many fundamental
processes during neurodevelopment. Disruption of GSK3 signalling adversely
affects brain development and is associated with several neurodevelopmental
disorders. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which GSK3 activity is regulated in
the nervous system and provide an overview of the recent advances in the
understanding of how GSK3 signalling controls neurogenesis, neuronal polarization
and axon growth during brain development. These recent advances suggest that GSK3
is a crucial node that mediates various cellular processes that are controlled by
multiple signalling molecules--for example, disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1),
partitioning defective homologue 3 (PAR3), PAR6 and Wnt proteins--that regulate
neurodevelopment.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in psychiatric and neurodegenerative

Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption are frequently observed in patients with
psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease. The abnormal sleep that is
experienced by these patients is largely assumed to be the product of medication 
or some other influence that is not well defined. However, normal brain function 
and the generation of sleep are linked by common neurotransmitter systems and
regulatory pathways. Disruption of sleep alters sleep-wake timing, destabilizes
physiology and promotes a range of pathologies (from cognitive to metabolic
defects) that are rarely considered to be associated with abnormal sleep. We
propose that brain disorders and abnormal sleep have a common mechanistic origin 
and that many co-morbid pathologies that are found in brain disease arise from a 
destabilization of sleep mechanisms. The stabilization of sleep may be a means by
which to reduce the symptoms of--and permit early intervention of--psychiatric
and neurodegenerative disease.

Ion channel clustering at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier has
been suggested to be a key evolutionary innovation that enabled the development
of the complex vertebrate nervous system. This innovation epitomizes a signature 
feature of neurons, namely polarity. The mechanisms that establish neuronal
polarity, channel clustering and axon-dendrite identity during development are
becoming clearer. However, much less is known about how polarity is maintained
throughout life. Here, I review the role of the AIS in the development and
maintenance of neuronal polarity and discuss how disrupted polarity may be a
common component of many diseases and injuries that affect the nervous system.

Surviving in a world with hidden rewards and dangers requires choosing the
appropriate behaviours. Recent discoveries indicate that the habenula plays a
prominent part in such behavioural choice through its effects on neuromodulator
systems, in particular the dopamine and serotonin systems. By inhibiting
dopamine-releasing neurons, habenula activation leads to the suppression of motor
behaviour when an animal fails to obtain a reward or anticipates an aversive
outcome. Moreover, the habenula is involved in behavioural responses to pain,
stress, anxiety, sleep and reward, and its dysfunction is associated with
depression, schizophrenia and drug-induced psychosis. As a highly conserved
structure in the brain, the habenula provides a fundamental mechanism for both
survival and decision-making.

Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown aetiology that
affects 1 in 100-150 individuals. Diagnosis is based on three categories of
behavioural criteria: abnormal social interactions, communication deficits and
repetitive behaviours. Strong evidence for a genetic basis has prompted the
development of mouse models with targeted mutations in candidate genes for
autism. As the diagnostic criteria for autism are behavioural, phenotyping these 
mouse models requires behavioural assays with high relevance to each category of 
the diagnostic symptoms. Behavioural neuroscientists are generating a
comprehensive set of assays for social interaction, communication and repetitive 
behaviours to test hypotheses about the causes of autism. Robust phenotypes in
mouse models hold great promise as translational tools for discovering effective 
treatments for components of autism spectrum disorders.

Long-term depression (LTD) in the CNS has been the subject of intense
investigation as a process that may be involved in learning and memory and in
various pathological conditions. Several mechanistically distinct forms of this
type of synaptic plasticity have been identified and their molecular mechanisms
are starting to be unravelled. Most studies have focused on forms of LTD that are
triggered by synaptic activation of either NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Converging evidence
supports a crucial role of LTD in some types of learning and memory and in
situations in which cognitive demands require a flexible response. In addition,
LTD may underlie the cognitive effects of acute stress, the addictive potential
of some drugs of abuse and the elimination of synapses in neurodegenerative
diseases.

Prominent models of human long-term memory distinguish between memory systems on 
the basis of whether learning and retrieval occur consciously or unconsciously.
Episodic memory formation requires the rapid encoding of associations between
different aspects of an event which, according to these models, depends on the
hippocampus and on consciousness. However, recent evidence indicates that the
hippocampus mediates rapid associative learning with and without consciousness in
humans and animals, for long-term and short-term retention. Consciousness seems
to be a poor criterion for differentiating between declarative (or explicit) and 
non declarative (or implicit) types of memory. A new model is therefore required 
in which memory systems are distinguished based on the processing operations
involved rather than by consciousness.

The vast computational power of the brain has traditionally been viewed as
arising from the complex connectivity of neural networks, in which an individual 
neuron acts as a simple linear summation and thresholding device. However, recent
studies show that individual neurons utilize a wealth of nonlinear mechanisms to 
transform synaptic input into output firing. These mechanisms can arise from
synaptic plasticity, synaptic noise, and somatic and dendritic conductances. This
tool kit of nonlinear mechanisms confers considerable computational power on both
morphologically simple and more complex neurons, enabling them to perform a range
of arithmetic operations on signals encoded ina variety of different ways.

Discoveries in fruit flies have greatly contributed to our understanding of
neuroscience. The use of an unparalleled wealth of tools, many of which
originated between 1910–1960, has enabled milestone discoveries in nervous system
development and function. Such findings have triggered and guided many research
efforts in vertebrate neuroscience. After 100 years, fruit flies continue to be
the choice model system for many neuroscientists. The combinational use of
powerful research tools will ensure that this model organism will continue to
lead to key discoveries that will impact vertebrate neuroscience.

Recent studies are beginning to paint a clear and consistent picture of the
impairments in psychological and cognitive competencies that are associated with 
microdeletions in chromosome 22q11.2. These studies have highlighted a strong
link between this genetic lesion and schizophrenia. Parallel studies in humans
and animal models are starting to uncover the complex genetic and neural
substrates altered by the microdeletion. In addition to offering a deeper
understanding of the effects of this genetic lesion, these findings may guide
analysis of other copy-number variants associated with cognitive dysfunction and 
psychiatric disorders.

The past decades have seen a revolution in our understanding of brain diseases
and in particular of drug addiction. This has been largely due to the
identification of neurotransmitter receptors and the development of animal
models, which together have enabled the investigation of brain functions from the
molecular to the cognitive level. Tobacco smoking, the principal - yet avoidable 
- cause of lung cancer is associated with nicotine addiction. Recent studies in
mice involving deletion and replacement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subunits have begun to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine
addiction and might offer new therapeutic strategies to treat this addiction.

The temporally and spatially restricted nature of the differentiation capacity of
cells in the neural lineage has been studied extensively in recent years.
Epigenetic control of developmental genes, which is heritable through cell
divisions, has emerged as a key mechanism defining the differentiation potential 
of cells. Short-term or reversible repression of developmental genes puts them in
a 'poised state', ready to be activated in response to differentiation-inducing
cues, whereas long-term or permanent repression of developmental genes restricts 
the cell fates they regulate. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the establishment and regulation of differentiation potential along the 
neural lineage during development.

Erratum in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Oct;11(10):726.

The discovery of mirror neurons in motor areas of the brain has led many to
assume that our ability to understand other people's behaviour partially relies
on vicarious activations of motor cortices. This Review focuses the limelight of 
social neuroscience on a different set of brain regions: the somatosensory
cortices. These have anatomical connections that enable them to have a role in
visual and auditory social perception. Studies that measure brain activity while 
participants witness the sensations, actions and somatic pain of others
consistently show vicarious activation in the somatosensory cortices.
Neuroscientists are starting to understand how the brain adds a somatosensory
dimension to our perception of other people.

Much of the original historical data behind the greatest discoveries in
neuroscience are now lost. However, a recently rediscovered box of histological
slides belonging to Sir Charles Sherrington, a pioneer in spinal cord and motor
control research, has survived at the University of Oxford since 1936.
Sherrington coined the term 'synapse', developed the concept of inhibition in
neuronal function, demonstrated the integration of sensory and motor actions of
the nervous system, and examined the synaptic activity of single neurons and
their integration into neuronal circuits. Here, we explore Sherrington's lifetime
of discoveries, with reference to histological specimens from his box of slides.

In ageing populations, neurodegenerative diseases increase in prevalence,
exacting an enormous toll on individuals and their communities. Multiple
complementary experimental approaches are needed to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying these complex diseases and to develop novel therapeutics. Here, we
describe why the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a unique role in the 
neurodegeneration armamentarium. As the best-understood and most readily analysed
eukaryotic organism, S. cerevisiae is delivering mechanistic insights into
cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration at an interactome-wide scale.

Type-specific dendrite morphology is a hallmark of the neuron and has important
functional implications in determining what signals a neuron receives and how
these signals are integrated. During the past two decades, studies on dendritic
arborization neurons in Drosophila melanogaster have started to identify
mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis that may have broad applicability to
vertebrate species. Transcription factors, receptor-ligand interactions, various 
signalling pathways, local translational machinery, cytoskeletal elements, Golgi 
outposts and endosomes have been identified as contributors to the organization
of dendrites of individual neurons and the placement of these dendrites in the
neuronal circuitry. Further insight into these mechanisms will improve our
understanding of how the nervous system functions and might help to identify the 
underlying causes of some neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Emerging roles for G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels 
in health and disease.

G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels hyperpolarize
neurons in response to activation of many different G protein-coupled receptors
and thus control the excitability of neurons through GIRK-mediated
self-inhibition, slow synaptic potentials and volume transmission. GIRK channel
function and trafficking are highly dependent on the channel subunit composition.
Pharmacological investigations of GIRK channels and studies in animal models
suggest that GIRK activity has an important role in physiological responses,
including pain perception and memory modulation. Moreover, abnormal GIRK function
has been implicated in altering neuronal excitability and cell death, which may
be important in the pathophysiology of diseases such as epilepsy, Down's
syndrome, Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. GIRK channels may therefore
prove to be a valuable new therapeutic target.

Action and perception are functionally linked in the brain, but a hotly debated
question is whether perception and comprehension of stimuli depend on motor
circuits. Brain language mechanisms are ideal for addressing this question.
Neuroimaging investigations have found specific motor activations when subjects
understand speech sounds, word meanings and sentence structures. Moreover,
studies involving transcranial magnetic stimulation and patients with lesions
affecting inferior frontal regions of the brain have shown contributions of motor
circuits to the comprehension of phonemes, semantic categories and grammar. These
data show that language comprehension benefits from frontocentral action systems,
indicating that action and perception circuits are interdependent.

Neurogenesis, the process of generating functional neurons from neural stem
cells, is tightly controlled by many intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.
Uncovering these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for understanding the functions
and plasticity of the human brain. Recent studies in both invertebrates and
vertebrates point to the importance of small regulatory RNAs in regulating
lineage-specific gene expression and determining neuronal identity during
neurogenesis. These new observations suggest that small regulatory RNAs could
function at many levels to regulate self-renewal of neural stem cells and
neuronal fate specification, implicating small regulatory RNAs in the complexity 
of neurogenesis.

New neurons and new memories: how does adult hippocampal neurogenesis affect
learning and memory?

The integration of adult-born neurons into the circuitry of the adult hippocampus
suggests an important role for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and
memory, but its specific function in these processes has remained elusive. In
this article, we summarize recent progress in this area, including advances based
on behavioural studies and insights provided by computational modelling.
Increasingly, evidence suggests that newborn neurons might be involved in
hippocampal functions that are particularly dependent on the dentate gyrus, such 
as pattern separation. Furthermore, newborn neurons at different maturation
stages may make distinct contributions to learning and memory. In particular,
computational studies suggest that, before newborn neurons are fully mature, they
might function as a pattern integrator by introducing a degree of similarity to
the encoding of events that occur closely in time.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has devastating acute effects and in many cases
seems to initiate long-term neurodegeneration. Indeed, an epidemiological
association between TBI and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in 
life has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques —
one of the hallmarks of AD — may be found in patients within hours following TBI.
Here, we explore the mechanistic underpinnings of the link between TBI and AD,
focusing on the hypothesis that rapid Aβ plaque formation may result from the
accumulation of amyloid precursor protein in damaged axons and a disturbed
balance between Aβ genesis and catabolism following TBI.

Synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie learning and memory, but the
complexity of the interactions between the ion channels, enzymes and genes that
are involved in synaptic plasticity impedes a deep understanding of this
phenomenon. Computer modelling has been used to investigate the information
processing that is performed by the signalling pathways involved in synaptic
plasticity in principal neurons of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. In
the past few years, new software developments that combine computational
neuroscience techniques with systems biology techniques have allowed large-scale,
kinetic models of the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation and 
long-term depression. We highlight important advancements produced by these
quantitative modelling efforts and introduce promising approaches that use
advancements in live-cell imaging.

Do astrocytes really exocytose neurotransmitters?

Hamilton NB(1), Attwell D.

In the past 20 years, an extra layer of information processing, in addition to
that provided by neurons, has been proposed for the CNS. Neuronally evoked
increases of the intracellular calcium concentration in astrocytes have been
suggested to trigger exocytotic release of the 'gliotransmitters' glutamate, ATP 
and D-serine. These are proposed to modulate neuronal excitability and
transmitter release, and to have a role in diseases as diverse as stroke,
epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and HIV infection. However, there is
intense controversy about whether astrocytes can exocytose transmitters in vivo. 
Resolving this issue would considerably advance our understanding of brain
function.

In addition to their role in providing myelin for rapid impulse propagation, the 
glia that ensheath long axons are required for the maintenance of normal axon
transport and long-term survival. This presumably ancestral function seems to be 
independent of myelin membrane wrapping. Here, I propose that ensheathing glia
provide trophic support to axons that are metabolically isolated, and that myelin
itself might cause such isolation. This glial support of axonal integrity may be 
relevant for a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

The parieto-frontal cortical circuit that is active during action observation is 
the circuit with mirror properties that has been most extensively studied. Yet,
there remains controversy on its role in social cognition and its contribution to
understanding the actions and intentions of other individuals. Recent studies in 
monkeys and humans have shed light on what the parieto-frontal cortical circuit
encodes and its possible functional relevance for cognition. We conclude that,
although there are several mechanisms through which one can understand the
behaviour of other individuals, the parieto-frontal mechanism is the only one
that allows an individual to understand the action of others 'from the inside'
and gives the observer a first-person grasp of the motor goals and intentions of 
other individuals.

Neuromarketing: the hope and hype of neuroimaging in business.

The application of neuroimaging methods to product marketing - neuromarketing -
has recently gained considerable popularity. We propose that there are two main
reasons for this trend. First, the possibility that neuroimaging will become
cheaper and faster than other marketing methods; and second, the hope that
neuroimaging will provide marketers with information that is not obtainable
through conventional marketing methods. Although neuroimaging is unlikely to be
cheaper than other tools in the near future, there is growing evidence that it
may provide hidden information about the consumer experience. The most promising 
application of neuroimaging methods to marketing may come before a product is
even released - when it is just an idea being developed.

The facial somatosensory map in the cortex is derived from facial representations
that are first established at the brainstem level and then serially 'copied' at
each stage of the somatosensory pathway. Recent studies have provided insights
into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of somatotopic maps of 
the face and whiskers in the trigeminal nuclei of the mouse brainstem. This work 
has revealed that early molecular regionalization and positional patterning of
trigeminal ganglion and brainstem target neurons are established by homeodomain
transcription factors, the expression of which is induced and maintained by
signals from the brain and face. Such position-dependent information is
fundamental in transforming the early spatial layout of sensory receptors into a 
topographic connectivity map that is conferred to higher brain levels.

Protein palmitoylation, a classical and common lipid modification, regulates
diverse aspects of neuronal protein trafficking and function. The reversible
nature of palmitoylation provides a potential general mechanism for protein
shuttling between intracellular compartments. The recent discovery of
palmitoylating enzymes--a large DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) protein family--and the
development of new proteomic and imaging methods have accelerated palmitoylation 
analysis. It is becoming clear that individual DHHC enzymes generate and maintain
the specialized compartmentalization of substrates in polarized neurons. Here, we
discuss the regulatory mechanisms for dynamic protein palmitoylation and the
emerging roles of protein palmitoylation in various aspects of pathophysiology,
including neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.

Olfactory signalling in vertebrates and insects: differences and commonalities.

Vertebrates and insects have evolved complex repertoires of chemosensory
receptors to detect and distinguish odours. With a few exceptions, vertebrate
chemosensory receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors that
initiate a cascade of cellular signalling events and thereby electrically excite 
the neuron. Insect receptors, which are structurally and genetically unrelated to
vertebrate receptors, are a complex of two distinct molecules that serves both as
a receptor for the odorant and as an ion channel that is gated by binding of the 
odorant. Metabotropic signalling in vertebrates provides a rich panoply of
positive and negative regulation, whereas ionotropic signalling in insects
enhances processing speed.

Neuroscience is contributing to an understanding of the biological bases of human
intelligence differences. This work is principally being conducted along two
empirical fronts: genetics--quantitative and molecular--and brain imaging.
Quantitative genetic studies have established that there are additive genetic
contributions to different aspects of cognitive ability--especially general
intelligence--and how they change through the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies
have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes.
Structural and functional brain-imaging studies have identified differences in
brain pathways, especially parieto-frontal pathways, that contribute to
intelligence differences. There is also evidence that brain efficiency correlates
positively with intelligence.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be experimentally derived or induced from different 
sources, and the NSC systems generated so far are promising tools for basic
research and biomedical applications. However, no direct and thorough comparison 
of their biological and molecular properties or of their physiological relevance 
and possible relationship to endogenous NSCs has yet been carried out. Here we
review the available information on different NSC systems and compare their
properties. A better understanding of these systems will be crucial to control
NSC fate and functional integration following transplantation and to make NSCs
suitable for regenerative efforts following injury or disease.

Neuronal synapses are important microstructures that underlie complex cognitive
capacities. Recent studies, primarily in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster, have revealed surprising parallels between these synapses and the
'chemosensory synapses' that reside at the tips of chemosensory cells that
respond to environmental stimuli. Similarities in the structures, mechanisms of
action and specific molecules found at these sites extend to the presynaptic,
postsynaptic and glial entities composing both synapse types. In this article I
propose that chemosensory synapses may serve as useful models of neuronal
synapses, and consider the possibility that the two synapse types derive from a
common ancestral structure.

Prion-like mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.

Frost B(1), Diamond MI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur,
Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Many non-infectious neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the
accumulation of fibrillar proteins. These diseases all exhibit features that are 
reminiscent of those of prionopathies, including phenotypic diversity and the
propagation of pathology. Furthermore, emerging studies of amyloid-beta,
alpha-synuclein and tau--proteins implicated in common neurodegenerative
diseases--suggest that they share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics
with prions. Propagation of protein misfolding in these diseases may therefore
occur through mechanisms similar to those that underlie prion pathogenesis. If
this hypothesis is verified in vivo, it will suggest new therapeutic strategies
to block propagation of protein misfolding throughout the brain.

Converging evidence from electrophysiological, physiological and anatomical
studies suggests that abnormalities in the synchronized oscillatory activity of
neurons may have a central role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Neural
oscillations are a fundamental mechanism for the establishment of precise
temporal relationships between neuronal responses that are in turn relevant for
memory, perception and consciousness. In patients with schizophrenia, the
synchronization of beta- and gamma-band activity is abnormal, suggesting a
crucial role for dysfunctional oscillations in the generation of the cognitive
deficits and other symptoms of the disorder. Dysfunctional oscillations may arise
owing to anomalies in the brain's rhythm-generating networks of GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons and in cortico-cortical connections.

Dynamic aspects of interactions between astrocytes, neurons and the vasculature
have recently been in the neuroscience spotlight. It has emerged that not only
neurons but also astrocytes are organized into networks. Whereas neuronal
networks exchange information through electrical and chemical synapses,
astrocytes are interconnected through gap junction channels that are regulated by
extra- and intracellular signals and allow exchange of information. This
intercellular communication between glia has implications for neuroglial and
gliovascular interactions and hence has added another level of complexity to our 
understanding of brain function.

A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action,
perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the
biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information
theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective.
Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization.
Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps
emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement,
surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is
optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global
brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.

Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly
acquired information in memory, depending on the specific conditions of learning 
and the timing of sleep. Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative
and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of
neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave
sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and
synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and
ripples - at minimum cholinergic activity - coordinate the re-activation and
redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas
during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene
activity - at high cholinergic and theta activity - might favour the subsequent
synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.

Rarely in the history of neuroscience has a single illustration been as
influential as the cytoarchitectonic map of the human brain published by
Korbinian Brodmann in his monograph from 1909. The map presents the segregation
of the cerebral cortex into 43 areas, as visible in cell body-stained
histological sections. More importantly, Brodmann provided a comparative
neuroanatomical approach and discussed ontogenetic and pathological aspects as
well as structural-functional correlations. One hundred years later, a large
number of neuroscientists still use Brodmann's map for localizing neuroimaging
data obtained in the living human brain.

The roles of the Wnt signalling pathway in several developmental processes,
including synaptic differentiation, are well characterized. The expression of Wnt
ligands and Wnt signalling components in the mature mammalian CNS suggests that
this pathway might also play a part in synaptic maintenance and function. In
fact, Wnts have a crucial role in synaptic physiology, as they modulate the
synaptic vesicle cycle, the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors and the
interaction of these receptors with scaffold proteins in postsynaptic regions. In
addition, Wnts participate in adult neurogenesis and protect excitatory synaptic 
terminals from amyloid-beta oligomer toxicity. Here, the latest insights into the
function of Wnt signalling in the adult nervous system and therapeutic
opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease are discussed.

A plethora of discoveries relating to sex influences on brain function is rapidly
moving this field into the spotlight for most areas of neuroscience. The domain
of molecular or genetic neuroscience is no exception. The goal of this article is
to highlight key developments concerning sex-based dimorphisms in molecular
neuroscience, describe control mechanisms regulating these differences, address
the implications of these dimorphisms for normal and abnormal brain function and 
discuss what these advances mean for future work in the field. The overriding
conclusion is that, as for neuroscience in general, molecular neuroscience has to
take into account potential sex influences that might modify signalling pathways.

The cerebellar microcircuit as an adaptive filter: experimental and computational
evidence.

Initial investigations of the cerebellar microcircuit inspired the Marr-Albus
theoretical framework of cerebellar function. We review recent developments in
the experimental understanding of cerebellar microcircuit characteristics and in 
the computational analysis of Marr-Albus models. We conclude that many Marr-Albus
models are in effect adaptive filters, and that evidence for symmetrical
long-term potentiation and long-term depression, interneuron plasticity, silent
parallel fibre synapses and recurrent mossy fibre connectivity is strikingly
congruent with predictions from adaptive-filter models of cerebellar function.
This congruence suggests that insights from adaptive-filter theory might help to 
address outstanding issues of cerebellar function, including both microcircuit
processing and extra-cerebellar connectivity.

Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is defined as a long-term improvement in
performance on a visual task. In recent years, the idea that conscious effort is 
necessary for VPL to occur has been challenged by research suggesting the
involvement of more implicit processing mechanisms, such as reinforcement-driven 
processing and consolidation. In addition, we have learnt much about the neural
substrates of VPL and it has become evident that changes in visual areas and
regions beyond the visual cortex can take place during VPL.

Mechanisms underlying spontaneous patterned activity in developing neural
circuits.

California 92093, USA.

Patterned, spontaneous activity occurs in many developing neural circuits,
including the retina, the cochlea, the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the
hippocampus, where it provides signals that are important for the development of 
neurons and their connections. Despite there being differences in adult
architecture and output across these various circuits, the patterns of
spontaneous network activity and the mechanisms that generate it are remarkably
similar. The mechanisms can include a depolarizing action of GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid), transient synaptic connections, extrasynaptic
transmission, gap junction coupling and the presence of pacemaker-like neurons.
Interestingly, spontaneous activity is robust; if one element of a circuit is
disrupted another will generate similar activity. This research suggests that
developing neural circuits exhibit transient and tunable features that maintain a
source of correlated activity during crucial stages of development.

There is increasing pressure for neuroscientists to communicate their research
and the societal implications of their findings to the public. Communicating
science is challenging, and the transformation of communication by digital and
interactive media increases the complexity of the challenge. To facilitate
dialogue with the public in this new media landscape, we suggest three courses of
action for the neuroscience community: a cultural shift that explicitly
recognizes and rewards public outreach, the identification and development of
neuroscience communication experts, and ongoing empirical research on the public 
communication of neuroscience.

There is growing evidence that sensory deprivation is associated with crossmodal 
neuroplastic changes in the brain. After visual or auditory deprivation, brain
areas that are normally associated with the lost sense are recruited by spared
sensory modalities. These changes underlie adaptive and compensatory behaviours
in blind and deaf individuals. Although there are differences between these
populations owing to the nature of the deprived sensory modality, there seem to
be common principles regarding how the brain copes with sensory loss and the
factors that influence neuroplastic changes. Here, we discuss crossmodal
neuroplasticity with regards to behavioural adaptation after sensory deprivation 
and highlight the possibility of maladaptive consequences within the context of
rehabilitation.

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie learning is one of the most
fascinating and central aims of neurobiological research. Hippocampal long-term
potentiation (LTP) is widely regarded as a prime candidate for the cellular
mechanism of learning. The receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB (also known as NTRK2),
known primarily for its function during PNS and CNS development, has emerged in
recent years as a potent regulator of hippocampal LTP. Here I describe efforts to
understand the signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms that underlie the
involvement of TrkB in LTP and learning.

Interest in the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the nervous system has
recently expanded to include their roles in neurodegeneration. Investigations
have begun to reveal the influence of miRNAs on both neuronal survival and the
accumulation of toxic proteins that are associated with neurodegeneration, and
are providing clues as to how these toxic proteins can influence miRNA
expression.

It is important to understand the balance between cortical plasticity and
stability in various systems and across spatial scales in the adult brain. Here
we review studies of adult plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1), which has a 
key role in distributing visual information. There are claims of plasticity at
multiple spatial scales in adult V1, but a number of inconsistencies in the
supporting data raise questions about the extent and nature of such plasticity.
Our understanding of the extent of plasticity in V1 is further limited by a lack 
of quantitative models to guide the interpretation of the data. These problems
limit efforts to translate research findings about adult cortical plasticity into
significant clinical, educational and policy applications.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for changing established behaviour in
the face of unexpected outcomes. This function has been attributed to the role of
the OFC in response inhibition or to the idea that the OFC is a rapidly flexible 
associative-learning area. However, recent data contradict these accounts, and
instead suggest that the OFC is crucial for signalling outcome expectancies. We
suggest that this function--signalling of expected outcomes--can also explain the
crucial role of the OFC in changing behaviour in the face of unexpected outcomes.

Reductions in blood flow to the brain of sufficient duration and extent lead to
stroke, which results in damage to neuronal networks and the impairment of
sensation, movement or cognition. Evidence from animal models suggests that a
time-limited window of neuroplasticity opens following a stroke, during which the
greatest gains in recovery occur. Plasticity mechanisms include
activity-dependent rewiring and synapse strengthening. The challenge for
improving stroke recovery is to understand how to optimally engage and modify
surviving neuronal networks, to provide new response strategies that compensate
for tissue lost to injury.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of post-transcriptional gene
regulation in a plethora of tissues, including the nervous system. Recent
evidence points to a widespread role for neural miRNAs at various stages of
synaptic development, including dendritogenesis, synapse formation and synapse
maturation. Furthermore, studies from invertebrates indicate that miRNAs might
contribute to the control of synapse function and plasticity in the adult. Key
features of synapse-relevant miRNAs include their ability to regulate mRNA
translation locally in the synaptodendritic compartment and the modulation of
their expression and function by neuronal activity. The potentially huge impact
of miRNA-based mechanisms on higher-order processing, memory and neuropsychiatric
disorders in vertebrates is just starting to be recognized.

Neuroscience addresses questions that, if resolved, will reveal aspects of our
individuality. Therefore neuroscientific knowledge is not solely constrained
within laboratories, but readily captures the attention of the public at large.
Ideas, concepts and images in neuroscience widely circulate in culture and are
portrayed in literature, film, works of art, the mass media and commercial
products, therefore shaping social values and consumer practices. The interaction
between art and science offers an opportunity to make the scientific community
and the public aware of the social and ethical implications of the scientific
advances in neuroscience.

The Allen Brain Atlas, a Web-based, genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the
adult mouse brain, was an experiment on a massive scale. The development of the
atlas faced a combination of great technical challenges and a non-traditional
open research model, and it encountered many hurdles on the path to completion
and community adoption. Having overcome these challenges, it is now a fundamental
tool for neuroscientists worldwide and has set the stage for the creation of
other similar open resources. Nevertheless, there are many untapped opportunities
for exploration.

The past few years have witnessed dramatic progress on all frontiers of zinc
neurobiology. The recent development of powerful tools, including zinc-sensitive 
fluorescent probes, selective chelators and genetically modified animal models,
has brought a deeper understanding of the roles of this cation as a crucial
intra- and intercellular signalling ion of the CNS, and hence of the
neurophysiological importance of zinc-dependent pathways and the injurious
effects of zinc dyshomeostasis. The development of some innovative therapeutic
strategies is aimed at controlling and preventing the damaging effects of this
cation in neurological conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.

The past decade has seen a transformation in research on the retrosplenial cortex
(RSC). This cortical area has emerged as a key member of a core network of brain 
regions that underpins a range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory,
navigation, imagination and planning for the future. It is now also evident that 
the RSC is consistently compromised in the most common neurological disorders
that impair memory. Here we review advances on multiple fronts, most notably in
neuroanatomy, animal studies and neuroimaging, that have highlighted the
importance of the RSC for cognition, and consider why specifying its precise

Dreaming has fascinated and mystified humankind for ages: the bizarre and
evanescent qualities of dreams have invited boundless speculation about their
origin, meaning and purpose. For most of the twentieth century, scientific dream 
theories were mainly psychological. Since the discovery of rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep, the neural underpinnings of dreaming have become increasingly well
understood, and it is now possible to complement the details of these brain
mechanisms with a theory of consciousness that is derived from the study of
dreaming. The theory advanced here emphasizes data that suggest that REM sleep
may constitute a protoconscious state, providing a virtual reality model of the
world that is of functional use to the development and maintenance of waking
consciousness.

Neurons and glial cells show mutual interdependence in many developmental and
functional aspects of their biology. To establish their intricate relationships
with neurons, glial cells must migrate over what are often long distances. In the
CNS glial cells generally migrate as single cells, whereas PNS glial cells tend
to migrate as cohorts of cells. How are their journeys initiated and directed,
and what stops the migratory phase once glial cells are aligned with their
neuronal counterparts? A deeper understanding of glial migration and the
underlying neuron-glia interactions may contribute to the development of
therapeutics for demyelinating diseases or glial tumours.

The enlargement and species-specific elaboration of the cerebral neocortex during
evolution holds the secret to the mental abilities of humans; however, the
genetic origin and cellular mechanisms that generated the distinct evolutionary
advancements are not well understood. This article describes how novelties that
make us human may have been introduced during evolution, based on findings in the
embryonic cerebral cortex in different mammalian species. The data on the
differences in gene expression, new molecular pathways and novel cellular
interactions that have led to these evolutionary advances may also provide
insight into the pathogenesis and therapies for human-specific neuropsychiatric
disorders.

For many years the mammalian CNS has been seen as an organ that is unable to
regenerate. However, it was also long known that lower vertebrate species are
capable of impressive regeneration of CNS structures. How did this situation
arise through evolution? Increasing cellular and molecular understanding of
regeneration in different animal species coupled with studies of adult
neurogenesis in mammals is providing a basis for addressing this question. Here
we compare CNS regeneration among vertebrates and speculate on how this ability
may have emerged or been restricted.

The vertebrate brain is highly complex with millions to billions of neurons.
During development, the neural plate border region gives rise to the neural
crest, cranial placodes and, in anamniotes, to Rohon-Beard sensory neurons,
whereas the boundary region of the midbrain and hindbrain develops organizer
properties. Comparisons of developmental gene expression and neuroanatomy between
vertebrates and the basal chordate amphioxus, which has only thousands of neurons
and lacks a neural crest, most placodes and a midbrain-hindbrain organizer,
indicate that these vertebrate features were built on a foundation already
present in the ancestral chordate. Recent advances in genomics have provided
insights into the elaboration of the molecular toolkit at the
invertebrate-vertebrate transition that may have facilitated the evolution of
these vertebrate characteristics.

Evolutionary developmental biology, often called evo-devo, seeks to understand
the ancestral relationship among organisms by comparing their developmental
strategies and ultimately reconstructing the pathways that led to the
extraordinary variety of biological forms. The insights from this synthesis of
developmental biology and evolutionary principles are useful for understanding
the development of the nervous system. The pervasive and crucial roles of
microRNAs in nervous system development suggest that these short non-coding
transcripts deserve a chapter in the unfolding evo-devo story. The structure of
microRNAs, their physical proximity to other genes and their network effects on
targets make this class of transcripts tractable genetic material for
evolutionary change.

Understanding the evolutionary origins of behaviour is a central aim in the study
of biology and may lead to insights into human disorders. Synaptic transmission
is observed in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate organisms and
underlies their behaviour. Proteomic studies of the molecular components of the
highly complex mammalian postsynaptic machinery point to an ancestral molecular
machinery in unicellular organisms--the protosynapse--that existed before the
evolution of metazoans and neurons, and hence challenges existing views on the
origins of the brain. The phylogeny of the molecular components of the synapse
provides a new model for studying synapse diversity and complexity, and their
implications for brain evolution.

Sleep is often viewed as a vulnerable state that is incompatible with behaviours 
that nourish and propagate species. This has led to the hypothesis that sleep has
survived because it fulfills some universal, but as yet unknown, vital function. 
I propose that sleep is best understood as a variant of dormant states seen
throughout the plant and animal kingdoms and that it is itself highly adaptive
because it optimizes the timing and duration of behaviour. Current evidence
indicates that ecological variables are the main determinants of sleep duration
and intensity across species.

The fundamental architecture of the cerebellum is concealed within a
terminological forest - transverse zones and stripes, longitudinal zones and
microzones, patches, etc. To make things worse, the same term is used in
different contexts to describe quite different patterns of spatial localization. 
Here we consider the possibility that this complexity hides the fact that the
cerebellar cortex contains only one map, which has been charted in various ways.

Synaptic plasticity in adult neural circuits may involve the strengthening or
weakening of existing synapses as well as structural plasticity, including
synapse formation and elimination. Indeed, long-term in vivo imaging studies are 
beginning to reveal the structural dynamics of neocortical neurons in the normal 
and injured adult brain. Although the overall cell-specific morphology of axons
and dendrites, as well as of a subpopulation of small synaptic structures, are
remarkably stable, there is increasing evidence that experience-dependent
plasticity of specific circuits in the somatosensory and visual cortex involves
cell type-specific structural plasticity: some boutons and dendritic spines
appear and disappear, accompanied by synapse formation and elimination,
respectively. This Review focuses on recent evidence for such structural forms of
synaptic plasticity in the mammalian cortex and outlines open questions.

Comment in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Nov;10(11):829.

The frontal lobes in the brain are a component of the cerebral system that
supports goal-directed behaviour. However, their functional organization remains 
controversial. Recent studies have reported rostro-caudal distinctions in frontal
cortex activity based on the abstractness of action representations. In addition,
some have proposed that these differences reflect a hierarchical organization,
whereby anterior frontal regions influence processing by posterior frontal
regions during the realization of abstract action goals as motor acts. However,
few have considered whether the anatomy and physiology of the frontal lobes
support such a scheme. To address this gap, this Review surveys anatomical,
neuroimaging, electrophysiological and developmental findings, and considers the 
question: could the organization of the frontal cortex be hierarchical?

Biomaterials are likely to have an increasingly important role in the treatment
of nervous system disorders. Recently developed biomaterials can enable and
augment the targeted delivery of drugs or therapeutic proteins to the brain,
allow cell or tissue transplants to be effectively delivered to the brain and
help to rebuild damaged circuits. Similarly, biomaterials are being used to
promote regeneration and to repair damaged neuronal pathways in combination with 
stem cell therapies. Many of these approaches are gaining momentum because
nanotechnology allows greater control over material-cell interactions that induce
specific developmental processes and cellular responses including
differentiation, migration and outgrowth.

It has been known for a long time that genetic factors affect sleep quantity and 
quality. Genetic screens have identified several mutations that affect sleep
across species, pointing to an evolutionary conserved regulation of sleep.
Moreover, it has also been recognized that sleep affects gene expression. These
findings have given valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of sleep
regulation and function that might lead the way to more efficient treatments for 
sleep disorders.

Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a relentless preoccupation with dieting
and weight loss that results in severe emaciation and sometimes death. It is
controversial whether such symptoms are secondary to psychosocial influences, are
a consequence of obsessions and anxiety or reflect a primary disturbance of brain
appetitive circuits. New brain imaging technology provides insights into ventral 
and dorsal neural circuit dysfunction - perhaps related to altered serotonin and 
dopamine metabolism - that contributes to the puzzling symptoms found in people
with eating disorders. For example, altered insula activity could explain
interoceptive dysfunction, and altered striatal activity might shed light on
altered reward modulation in people with anorexia nervosa.

How the olfactory bulb got its glomeruli: a just so story?

The nearly 2,000 glomeruli that cover the surface of the olfactory bulb are so
distinctive that they were noted specifically in the earliest of Cajal's
catalogues. They have variously been considered a functional unit, an
organizational unit and a crucial component of the olfactory coding circuit.
Despite their central position in olfactory processing, the development of the
glomeruli has only recently begun to be investigated with new and powerful
genetic tools. Some unexpected findings have been made that may lead to a new
understanding of the processes involved in wiring sensory regions of the brain.
It may no longer be sufficient to simply invoke genes, spikes and their interplay
in the construction of brain circuits. The story of 'how the olfactory bulb got
its glomeruli' may be more complex, and more revealing, than has been supposed.

Spinal muscular atrophy: why do low levels of survival motor neuron protein make 
motor neurons sick?

Many neurogenetic disorders are caused by the mutation of ubiquitously expressed 
genes. One such disorder, spinal muscular atrophy, is caused by loss or mutation 
of the survival motor neuron1 gene (SMN1), leading to reduced SMN protein levels 
and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons. SMN, together with partner
proteins, functions in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs),
which are important for pre-mRNA splicing. It has also been suggested that SMN
might function in the assembly of other ribonucleoprotein complexes. Two
hypotheses have been proposed to explain the molecular dysfunction that gives
rise to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and its specificity to a particular group
of neurons. The first hypothesis states that the loss of SMN's well-known
function in snRNP assembly causes an alteration in the splicing of a specific
gene (or genes). The second hypothesis proposes that SMN is crucial for the
transport of mRNA in neurons and that disruption of this function results in SMA.

The glutamate homeostasis hypothesis of addiction.

South Carolina 29425, USA. kalivasp@musc.edu

Addiction is associated with neuroplasticity in the corticostriatal brain
circuitry that is important for guiding adaptive behaviour. The hierarchy of
corticostriatal information processing that normally permits the prefrontal
cortex to regulate reinforcement-seeking behaviours is impaired by chronic drug
use. A failure of the prefrontal cortex to control drug-seeking behaviours can be
linked to an enduring imbalance between synaptic and non-synaptic glutamate,
termed glutamate homeostasis. The imbalance in glutamate homeostasis engenders
changes in neuroplasticity that impair communication between the prefrontal
cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Some of these pathological changes are amenable
to new glutamate- and neuroplasticity-based pharmacotherapies for treating
addiction.

inspired by much simpler laboratory tasks. In this way we hope to inspire
neuroscientists to consider how their basic research might help to explain
sporting skill at the highest levels of performance.

Research on brain-machine interfaces has been ongoing for at least a decade.
During this period, simultaneous recordings of the extracellular electrical
activity of hundreds of individual neurons have been used for direct, real-time
control of various artificial devices. Brain-machine interfaces have also added
greatly to our knowledge of the fundamental physiological principles governing
the operation of large neural ensembles. Further understanding of these
principles is likely to have a key role in the future development of

Neurobiologists have long sought to understand how circuits in the nervous system
are organized to generate the precise neural outputs that underlie particular
behaviours. The motor circuits in the spinal cord that control locomotion,
commonly referred to as central pattern generator networks, provide an
experimentally tractable model system for investigating how moderately complex
ensembles of neurons generate select motor behaviours. The advent of novel
molecular and genetic techniques coupled with recent advances in our knowledge of
spinal cord development means that a comprehensive understanding of how the motor
circuitry is organized and operates may be within our grasp.

Acute neurological conditions such as cerebrovascular diseases and trauma are
associated with irreversible loss of neurons and glial cells. Severe or prolonged
injury results in uncontrollable cell death within the core of lesions.
Conversely, cells that are less severely damaged succumb in a relatively slow
fashion, frequently via the intrinsic pathway of cell death, through the
deterioration of mitochondrial functions. The permeabilization of mitochondrial
membranes determines whether cells will succumb to or survive the injury, and
represents a 'point of no return' in mitochondrial cell death. It is therefore an
attractive target for the development of new neuroprotective interventions.

It was recently discovered that two different types of voltage-insensitive K+
channels, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) and small-conductance
Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, are located on dendritic branches, spines and
shafts in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses in many central
neurons. Together with increases in our knowledge of how these channels are

The characterization of mouse models of human disease is essential for
understanding the underlying pathophysiology and developing new therapeutics.
Many diseases are often associated with more than one model, and so there is a
need to determine which model most closely represents the disease state or is
most suited to the therapeutic approach under investigation. In the case of
neurological disease, motor tests provide a good read-out of neurological
function. This overview of available motor tasks aims to aid researchers in
making the correct choice of test when attempting to tease out a transgenic
phenotype or when assessing the recovery of motor function following therapeutic 
intervention.

Electrical synaptic transmission through gap junctions underlies direct and rapid
neuronal communication in the CNS. The diversity of functional roles that
electrical synapses have is perhaps best exemplified in the vertebrate retina, in
which gap junctions are formed by each of the five major neuron types. These
junctions are dynamically regulated by ambient illumination and by circadian
rhythms acting through light-activated neuromodulators such as dopamine and
nitric oxide, which in turn activate intracellular signalling pathways in the
retina.The networks formed by electrically coupled neurons are plastic and
reconfigurable, and those in the retina are positioned to play key and diverse
parts in the transmission and processing of visual information at every retinal
level.

Emotionally significant experiences tend to be well remembered, and the amygdala 
has a pivotal role in this process. But the efficient encoding of emotional
memories can become maladaptive - severe stress often turns them into a source of
chronic anxiety. Here, we review studies that have identified neural correlates
of stress-induced modulation of amygdala structure and function - from cellular
mechanisms to their behavioural consequences. The unique features of
stress-induced plasticity in the amygdala, in association with changes in other
brain regions, could have long-term consequences for cognitive performance and
pathological anxiety exhibited in people with affective disorders.

Neural regulation of endocrine and autonomic stress responses.

Author information:

The survival and well-being of all species requires appropriate physiological
responses to environmental and homeostatic challenges. The re- establishment and 
maintenance of homeostasis entails the coordinated activation and control of
neuroendocrine and autonomic stress systems. These collective stress responses
are mediated by largely overlapping circuits in the limbic forebrain, the
hypothalamus and the brainstem, so that the respective contributions of the
neuroendocrine and autonomic systems are tuned in accordance with stressor
modality and intensity. Limbic regions that are responsible for regulating stress
responses intersect with circuits that are responsible for memory and reward,
providing a means to tailor the stress response with respect to prior experience 
and anticipated outcomes.

Every individual experiences stressful life events. In some cases acute or
chronic stress leads to depression and other psychiatric disorders, but most
people are resilient to such effects. Recent research has begun to identify the
environmental, genetic, epigenetic and neural mechanisms that underlie
resilience, and has shown that resilience is mediated by adaptive changes in
several neural circuits involving numerous neurotransmitter and molecular
pathways. These changes shape the functioning of the neural circuits that
regulate reward, fear, emotion reactivity and social behaviour, which together
are thought to mediate successful coping with stress.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) - the most evolved brain region - subserves our
highest-order cognitive abilities. However, it is also the brain region that is
most sensitive to the detrimental effects of stress exposure. Even quite mild
acute uncontrollable stress can cause a rapid and dramatic loss of prefrontal
cognitive abilities, and more prolonged stress exposure causes architectural
changes in prefrontal dendrites. Recent research has begun to reveal the
intracellular signalling pathways that mediate the effects of stress on the PFC. 
This research has provided clues as to why genetic or environmental insults that 
disinhibit stress signalling pathways can lead to symptoms of profound prefrontal
cortical dysfunction in mental illness.

Chronic exposure to stress hormones, whether it occurs during the prenatal
period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood or aging, has an impact on
brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. However, the specific
effects on the brain, behaviour and cognition emerge as a function of the timing 
and the duration of the exposure, and some also depend on the interaction between
gene effects and previous exposure to environmental adversity. Advances in animal
and human studies have made it possible to synthesize these findings, and in this
Review a model is developed to explain why different disorders emerge in
individuals exposed to stress at different times in their lives.

The neuro-symphony of stress.

Author information:

The impact of stress on brain function is increasingly recognized. Various
substances are released in response to stress and can influence distinct neuronal
circuits, but the functional advantages of having such a diversity of stress
mediators remain unclear. Individual neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and steroid
stress mediators have specific spatial and temporal niches, but these niches also
overlap. In addition, the effects of individual mediators on neuronal function
and plasticity are integrated, and emerging evidence suggests that there is
crosstalk between them. Together, this results in the stress instruments
producing an orchestrated 'symphony' that enables fine-tuned responses to diverse
challenges.

Traditional descriptions of the cortical cholinergic input system focused on the 
diffuse organization of cholinergic projections and the hypothesis that slowly
changing levels of extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) mediate different arousal
states. The ability of ACh to reach the extrasynaptic space (volume
neurotransmission), as opposed to remaining confined to the synaptic cleft (wired
neurotransmission), has been considered an integral component of this
conceptualization. Recent studies demonstrated that phasic release of ACh, at the
scale of seconds, mediates precisely defined cognitive operations. This
characteristic of cholinergic neurotransmission is proposed to be of primary
importance for understanding cholinergic function and developing treatments for
cognitive disorders that result from abnormal cholinergic neurotransmission.

Information transfer at chemical synapses occurs when vesicles fuse with the
plasma membrane and release neurotransmitter. This process is stochastic and its 
likelihood of occurrence is a crucial factor in the regulation of signal
propagation in neuronal networks. The reliability of neurotransmitter release can
be highly variable: experimental data from electrophysiological, molecular and
imaging studies have demonstrated that synaptic terminals can individually set
their neurotransmitter release probability dynamically through local feedback
regulation. This local tuning of transmission has important implications for
current models of single-neuron computation.

During the past decade enormous advances have been made in our understanding of
the basic molecular machinery that is involved in the development of neuronal
polarity. Far from being mere structural elements, microtubules are emerging as
key determinants of neuronal polarity. Here we review the current understanding
of the regulation of microtubule assembly, organization and dynamics in axons and
dendrites. These studies provide new insight into microtubules' function in
neuronal development and their potential contribution to plasticity.

Incoming sensory information is sent to the brain along modality-specific
channels corresponding to the five senses. Each of these channels further parses 
the incoming signals into parallel streams to provide a compact, efficient input 
to the brain. Ultimately, these parallel input signals must be elaborated on and 
integrated in the cortex to provide a unified and coherent percept. Recent
studies in the primate visual cortex have greatly contributed to our
understanding of how this goal is accomplished. Multiple strategies including
retinal tiling, hierarchical and parallel processing and modularity, defined
spatially and by cell type-specific connectivity, are used by the visual system
to recover the intricate detail of our visual surroundings.

The vast majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are late-onset and their
development is probably influenced by both genetic and environmental risk
factors. A strong genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the presence of the
epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which encodes a protein with
crucial roles in cholesterol metabolism. There is mounting evidence that APOE4
contributes to AD pathogenesis by modulating the metabolism and aggregation of
amyloid-beta peptide and by directly regulating brain lipid metabolism and
synaptic functions through APOE receptors. Emerging knowledge of the contribution
of APOE to the pathophysiology of AD presents new opportunities for AD therapy.

Converging evidence suggests that each parahippocampal and hippocampal subregion 
contributes uniquely to the encoding, consolidation and retrieval of declarative 
memories, but their precise roles remain elusive. Current functional thinking
does not fully incorporate the intricately connected networks that link these
subregions, owing to their organizational complexity; however, such detailed
anatomical knowledge is of pivotal importance for comprehending the unique
functional contribution of each subregion. We have therefore developed an
interactive diagram with the aim to display all of the currently known anatomical
connections of the rat parahippocampal-hippocampal network. In this Review, we
integrate the existing anatomical knowledge into a concise description of this
network and discuss the functional implications of some relatively underexposed
connections.

Author information:

The wiring of the nervous system requires a complex orchestration of
developmental events. Emerging evidence suggests that transient cell-cell
interactions often serve as positional cues for axon guidance and synaptogenesis 
during the assembly of neural circuits. In contrast to the relatively stable
cellular interactions between synaptic partners in mature circuits, these
transient interactions involve cells that are not destined to be pre- or
postsynaptic cells. Here we review the roles of these transient cell-cell
interactions in a variety of developmental contexts and describe the mechanisms
through which they organize neural connections.

Comment in

The effects of prenatal exposure to drugs on brain development are complex and
are modulated by the timing, dose and route of drug exposure. It is difficult to 
assess these effects in clinical cohorts as these are beset with problems such as
multiple exposures and difficulties in documenting use patterns. This can lead to
misinterpretation of research findings by the general public, the media and
policy makers, who may mistakenly assume that the legal status of a drug
correlates with its biological impact on fetal brain development and long-term
clinical outcomes. It is important to close the gap between what science tells us
about the impact of prenatal drug exposure on the fetus and the mother and what
we do programmatically with regard to at-risk populations.

A little more conversation, a little less action--candidate roles for the motor

Author information:

Square, London, UK.

The motor theory of speech perception assumes that activation of the motor system
is essential in the perception of speech. However, deficits in speech perception 
and comprehension do not arise from damage that is restricted to the motor
cortex, few functional imaging studies reveal activity in the motor cortex during
speech perception, and the motor cortex is strongly activated by many different
sound categories. Here, we evaluate alternative roles for the motor cortex in
spoken communication and suggest a specific role in sensorimotor processing in
conversation. We argue that motor cortex activation is essential in joint speech,
particularly for the timing of turn taking.

The formation of axons and dendrites and maintenance of the neuron's vastly
expanded surface require the continuous addition of new membrane. This is
achieved by membrane synthesis through the secretory pathway followed by
regulated vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, typically in the distal
neurite. However, it is far from simple: multiple distinct membrane carriers are 
used to target specific membrane domains, dendrites seem to operate
semi-autonomously from the rest of the neuron, and exocytosis for membrane
expansion is different from that for release of synaptic vesicles. Current
knowledge of this process and its implications for neuronal development, function
and repair are reviewed.

Comment in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Jun;10(6):466.

Many are frustrated with the lack of translational progress in the pain field, in
which huge gains in basic science knowledge obtained using animal models have not
led to the development of many new clinically effective compounds. A careful
re-examination of animal models of pain is therefore warranted. Pain researchers 
now have at their disposal a much wider range of mutant animals to study, assays 
that more closely resemble clinical pain states, and dependent measures beyond
simple reflexive withdrawal. However, the complexity of the phenomenon of pain
has made it difficult to assess the true value of these advances. In addition,
pain studies are importantly affected by a wide range of modulatory factors,

Following CNS injury, in an apparently counterintuitive response, scar tissue
formation inhibits axonal growth, imposing a major barrier to regeneration.
Accordingly, scar-modulating treatments have become a leading therapeutic goal in
the field of spinal cord injury. However, increasing evidence suggests a
beneficial role for this scar tissue as part of the endogenous local immune
regulation and repair process. How can these opposing effects be reconciled?
Perhaps it is all a matter of timing.

Consolidated memories can re-enter states of transient instability following
reactivation, from which they must again stabilize in order to persist,
contradicting the previously dominant view that memory and its associated
plasticity mechanisms progressively and irreversibly decline with time. We
witness exciting times, as neuroscience begins embracing a position, long-held in
cognitive psychology, that recognizes memory as a principally dynamic process. In
light of remaining controversy, we here establish that the same operational
definitions and types of evidence underpin the deduction of both reconsolidation 
and consolidation, thus validating the extrapolation that post-retrieval memory
plasticity reflects processes akin to those that stabilized the memory following 
acquisition.

To a large extent, progress in neuroscience has been driven by the study of
single-cell responses averaged over several repetitions of stimuli or behaviours.
However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating 
the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how 
the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron,
multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two
related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract
single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such
population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode
stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.

How (and why) the immune system makes us sleep.

Sleep Research, University of Milan Medical School, 20133 Milan, Italy.

Good sleep is necessary for physical and mental health. For example, sleep loss
impairs immune function, and sleep is altered during infection. Immune signalling
molecules are present in the healthy brain, where they interact with
neurochemical systems to contribute to the regulation of normal sleep. Animal
studies have shown that interactions between immune signalling molecules (such as
the cytokine interleukin 1) and brain neurochemical systems (such as the
serotonin system) are amplified during infection, indicating that these
interactions might underlie the changes in sleep that occur during infection. Why
should the immune system cause us to sleep differently when we are sick? We
propose that the alterations in sleep architecture during infection are
exquisitely tailored to support the generation of fever, which in turn imparts
survival value.

Mood, attention and motivation co-vary with activity in the neuromodulatory
systems of the brain to influence behaviour. These psychological states, mediated
by neuromodulators, have a profound influence on the cognitive processes of
attention, perception and, particularly, our ability to retrieve memories from
the past and make new ones. Moreover, many psychiatric and neurodegenerative
disorders are related to dysfunction of these neuromodulatory systems. Neurons of
the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus are the sole source of noradrenaline, a
neuromodulator that has a key role in all of these forebrain activities.
Elucidating the factors that control the activity of these neurons and the effect
of noradrenaline in target regions is key to understanding how the brain
allocates attention and apprehends the environment to select, store and retrieve 
information for generating adaptive behaviour.

Recent developments in the quantitative analysis of complex networks, based
largely on graph theory, have been rapidly translated to studies of brain network
organization. The brain's structural and functional systems have features of
complex networks--such as small-world topology, highly connected hubs and
modularity--both at the whole-brain scale of human neuroimaging and at a cellular
scale in non-human animals. In this article, we review studies investigating
complex brain networks in diverse experimental modalities (including structural
and functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and
electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the
basic principles of graph theory. We also highlight some of the technical
challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this
rapidly moving field.

A population of neural stem cells (NSCs) resides adjacent to the lateral
ventricles in the adult mammalian brain. Despite knowledge of their existence
since the early 1990s, their identity remains controversial, with evidence
suggesting that they may be ependymal cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP)-expressing subventricular zone (SVZ) cells or several distinct NSC
populations. This issue has major implications for the therapeutic use of NSCs as
well as for the study and treatment of brain cancers. Recent studies have both
shed light on the issue and added to the controversy.

The behavioural adjustment that follows the experience of conflict has been
extensively studied in humans, leading to influential models of executive-control
adjustment. Recent studies have revealed striking similarities in
conflict-induced behavioural adjustment between humans and monkeys, indicating
that monkeys can provide a model to study the underlying neural substrates and
mechanisms of such behaviour. These studies have advanced our knowledge about the
role of different prefrontal brain regions, including the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in executive-control
adjustment and suggest a pivotal role for the DLPFC in the dynamic tuning of
executive control and, consequently, in behavioural adaptation to changing
environments.

Most molecular and cellular studies of cognitive function have focused on either 
normal or pathological states, but recent research with transgenic mice has
started to address the mechanisms of enhanced cognition. These results point to
key synaptic and nuclear signalling events that can be manipulated to facilitate 
the induction or increase the stability of synaptic plasticity, and therefore
enhance the acquisition or retention of information. Here, we review these
surprising findings and explore their implications to both mechanisms of learning
and memory and to ongoing efforts to develop treatments for cognitive disorders. 
These findings represent the beginning of a fundamental new approach in the study
of enhanced cognition.

Organization and dynamics of PDZ-domain-related supramodules in the postsynaptic 
density.

As the major components of the postsynaptic density of excitatory neuronal
synapses, PDZ-domain-containing scaffold proteins regulate the clustering of
surface glutamate receptors, organize synaptic signalling complexes, participate 
in the dynamic trafficking of receptors and ion channels, and coordinate
cytoskeletal dynamics. These scaffold proteins often contain multiple PDZ
domains, with or without other protein-binding modules, and they usually lack
intrinsic enzymatic activities. Recent biochemical and structural studies have
shown that tandemly arranged PDZ domains often serve as structural and functional
supramodules that could regulate the organization and dynamics of synaptic
protein complexes, thus contributing to the broad range of neuronal activity.

A conspicuous ability of the brain is to seamlessly assimilate and process
spatial and temporal features of sensory stimuli. This ability is indispensable
for the recognition of natural stimuli. Yet, a general computational framework
for processing spatiotemporal stimuli remains elusive. Recent theoretical and
experimental work suggests that spatiotemporal processing emerges from the
interaction between incoming stimuli and the internal dynamic state of neural
networks, including not only their ongoing spiking activity but also their
'hidden' neuronal states, such as short-term synaptic plasticity.

The ability to respond to genotoxic stress is a prerequisite for the successful
development of the nervous system. Mutations in various DNA repair factors can
lead to human diseases that are characterized by pronounced neuropathology. In
many of these syndromes the neurological component is among the most deleterious 
aspects of the disease. The nervous system poses a particular challenge in terms 
of clinical intervention, as the neuropathology associated with these diseases
often arises during nervous system development and can be fully penetrant by
childhood. Understanding how DNA repair deficiency affects the nervous system
will provide a rational basis for therapies targeted at ameliorating the
neurological problems in these syndromes.

The anterior insular cortex (AIC) is implicated in a wide range of conditions and
behaviours, from bowel distension and orgasm, to cigarette craving and maternal
love, to decision making and sudden insight. Its function in the
re-representation of interoception offers one possible basis for its involvement 
in all subjective feelings. New findings suggest a fundamental role for the AIC
(and the von Economo neurons it contains) in awareness, and thus it needs to be
considered as a potential neural correlate of consciousness.

Glia have emerged as key contributors to pathological and chronic pain
mechanisms. On activation, both astrocytes and microglia respond to and release a
number of signalling molecules, which have protective and/or pathological
functions. Here we review the current understanding of the contribution of glia
to pathological pain and neuroprotection, and how the protective,
anti-inflammatory actions of glia are being harnessed to develop new drug targets
for neuropathic pain control. Given the prevalence of chronic pain and the
partial efficacy of current drugs, which exclusively target neuronal mechanisms, 
new strategies to manipulate neuron-glia interactions in pain processing hold
considerable promise.

NG2 cells (also known as polydendrocytes) are a population of CNS cells that are 
distinct from neurons, mature oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. They
can be identified by the expression of the proteoglycan NG2, have a highly
branched morphology and are distributed throughout the grey and white matter.
They differentiate into oligodendrocytes in vitro and have often been equated
with oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, whether polydendrocytes are
multipotential cells that can give rise to neurons and astrocytes as well as
oligodendrocytes is now highly debated. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies
indicate that polydendrocytes receive synaptic input from neurons, suggesting
that they are integrated in the neural network. This Review highlights recent
findings and unresolved questions related to the lineage and function of
polydendrocytes in the CNS.

Brain banks collect post-mortem human brains to foster research into human CNS
function and disease. They have been indispensable for uncovering the secrets of 
many diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. At a time when there are so
many open questions in neuroscience and the incidence of brain diseases continues
to increase in parallel with the aging of the population, brain banking remains
at the heart of brain research. However, the major source of brain banks, the
clinical autopsy, is rapidly falling into limbo. New strategies, including donor 
programmes, medico-legal autopsies and banking in networks, as well as fresh
considerations of the ethics and public relations, are required.

Perceiving is believing: a Bayesian approach to explaining the positive symptoms

Author information:

Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QQ, UK.

Advances in cognitive neuroscience offer us new ways to understand the symptoms
of mental illness by uniting basic neurochemical and neurophysiological
observations with the conscious experiences that characterize these symptoms.
Cognitive theories about the positive symptoms of schizophrenia--hallucinations
and delusions--have tended to treat perception and belief formation as distinct
processes. However, recent advances in computational neuroscience have led us to 
consider the unusual perceptual experiences of patients and their sometimes
bizarre beliefs as part of the same core abnormality--a disturbance in
error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs about the world. We suggest
that it is possible to understand these symptoms in terms of a disturbed
hierarchical Bayesian framework, without recourse to separate considerations of
experience and belief.

Author information:

Humans in different cultures develop a similar capacity to recognize the
emotional signals of diverse facial expressions. This capacity is mediated by a
brain network that involves emotion-related brain circuits and higher-level
visual-representation areas. Recent studies suggest that the key components of
this network begin to emerge early in life. The studies also suggest that initial
biases in emotion-related brain circuits and the early coupling of these circuits
and cortical perceptual areas provide a foundation for a rapid acquisition of
representations of those facial features that denote specific emotions.

The capacity for voluntary action is seen as essential to human nature. Yet
neuroscience and behaviourist psychology have traditionally dismissed the topic
as unscientific, perhaps because the mechanisms that cause actions have long been
unclear. However, new research has identified networks of brain areas, including 
the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal
cortex, that underlie voluntary action. These areas generate information for
forthcoming actions, and also cause the distinctive conscious experience of
intending to act and then controlling one's own actions. Volition consists of a
series of decisions regarding whether to act, what action to perform and when to 
perform it. Neuroscientific accounts of voluntary action may inform debates about
the nature of individual responsibility.

Measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) has been fundamental to our
understanding of how language is encoded in the brain. One particular ERP
response, the N400 response, has been especially influential as an index of
lexical and semantic processing. However, there remains a lack of consensus on
the interpretation of this component. Resolving this issue has important
consequences for neural models of language comprehension. Here we show that
evidence bearing on where the N400 response is generated provides key insights
into what it reflects. A neuroanatomical model of semantic processing is used as 
a guide to interpret the pattern of activated regions in functional MRI,
magnetoencephalography and intracranial recordings that are associated with
contextual semantic manipulations that lead to N400 effects.

The peak age of onset for many psychiatric disorders is adolescence, a time of
remarkable physical and behavioural changes. The processes in the brain that
underlie these behavioural changes have been the subject of recent
investigations. What do we know about the maturation of the human brain during
adolescence? Do structural changes in the cerebral cortex reflect synaptic
pruning? Are increases in white-matter volume driven by myelination? Is the
adolescent brain more or less sensitive to reward? Finding answers to these
questions might enable us to further our understanding of mental health during
adolescence.

VPS10P-domain receptors, such as SORLA and sortilin, constitute a recently
identified class of type-1 receptors that are expressed in neurons. Family
members are multifunctional proteins that target a range of ligands, including
trophic factors and neuropeptides but also other transmembrane proteins. New
findings have revealed unexpected roles for VPS10P-domain receptors as regulators
of neuronal viability and function through the regulation of both protein
transport and signal transduction. Loss of these activities might contribute to
the pathophysiology of devastating disorders of the nervous system, including
Alzheimer's disease, affective disorders and post-traumatic neuronal cell death.

Sleep is vital to cognitive performance, productivity, health and well-being.
Earlier theories of sleep presumed that it occurred at the level of the whole
organism and that it was governed by central control mechanisms. However,
evidence now indicates that sleep might be regulated at a more local level in the
brain: it seems to be a fundamental property of neuronal networks and is
dependent on prior activity in each network. Such local-network sleep might be
initiated by metabolically driven changes in the production of sleep-regulatory
substances. We discuss a mathematical model which illustrates that the sleep-like
states of individual cortical columns can be synchronized through humoral and
electrical connections, and that whole-organism sleep occurs as an emergent
property of local-network interactions.

Just as vision scientists study visual art and illusions to elucidate the
workings of the visual system, so too can cognitive scientists study cognitive
illusions to elucidate the underpinnings of cognition. Magic shows are a
manifestation of accomplished magic performers' deep intuition for and
understanding of human attention and awareness. By studying magicians and their
techniques, neuroscientists can learn powerful methods to manipulate attention
and awareness in the laboratory. Such methods could be exploited to directly
study the behavioural and neural basis of consciousness itself, for instance
through the use of brain imaging and other neural recording techniques.

Remyelination involves reinvesting demyelinated axons with new myelin sheaths. In
stark contrast to the situation that follows loss of neurons or axonal damage,
remyelination in the CNS can be a highly effective regenerative process. It is
mediated by a population of precursor cells called oligodendrocyte precursor
cells (OPCs), which are widely distributed throughout the adult CNS. However,
despite its efficiency in experimental models and in some clinical diseases,
remyelination is often inadequate in demyelinating diseases such as multiple
sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disease and a cause of neurological
disability in young adults. The failure of remyelination has profound
consequences for the health of axons, the progressive and irreversible loss of
which accounts for the progressive nature of these diseases. The mechanisms of
remyelination therefore provide critical clues for regeneration biologists that
help them to determine why remyelination fails in MS and in other demyelinating
diseases and how it might be enhanced therapeutically.

Ubiquitin, the proteasome and protein degradation in neuronal function and
dysfunction.

Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.

Eukaryotic protein degradation by the proteasome and the lysosome is a dynamic
and complex process in which ubiquitin has a key regulatory role. The distinctive
morphology of the postmitotic neuron creates unique challenges for protein
degradation systems with respect to cell-surface protein turnover and substrate
delivery to proteolytic machineries that are required for both synaptic
plasticity and self-renewal. Moreover, the discovery of ubiquitin-positive
protein aggregates in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases underlines
the importance and vulnerability of the degradative system in neurons. In this
article, we discuss the molecular mechanism of protein degradation in the neuron 
with respect to both its function and its dysfunction.

Silent synapses abound in the young brain, representing an early step in the
pathway of experience-dependent synaptic development. Discovered amidst the
debate over whether long-term potentiation reflects a presynaptic or a
postsynaptic modification, silent synapses--which in the hippocampal CA1 subfield
are characterized by the presence of NMDA receptors but not AMPA receptors--have 
stirred some mechanistic controversy of their own. Out of this literature has
emerged a model for synapse unsilencing that highlights the central role for
postsynaptic AMPA-receptor trafficking in the expression of excitatory synaptic
plasticity.

The supplementary motor complex consists of the supplementary motor area, the
supplementary eye field and the pre-supplementary motor area. In recent years,
these areas have come under increasing scrutiny from cognitive neuroscientists,
motor physiologists and clinicians because they seem to be crucial for linking
cognition to action. However, theories regarding their function vary widely. This
Review brings together the data regarding the supplementary motor regions,
highlighting outstanding issues and providing new perspectives for understanding 
their functions.

Asian promise: the state and future of collaborations in neuroscience.

Poo MM, Sander L, Fivaz M, Hayashi Y.

As investment in science and technology continues to grow in Asia, countries such
as China, Japan and Singapore are witnessing great improvements in their
neuroscience research environments; this is reflected in the opening of new
research institutions and in the influx of neuroscientists trained abroad.
Collaborative projects between researchers in these countries and laboratories in
the United States and Europe are not only helping to shape these institutions,
they are also leading to a surge in high-quality publications in both basic and
translational neuroscience, resulting in increasing international recognition.
Nature Reviews Neuroscience asks four neuroscientists about their collaborative
experiences and the impact that such collaborations are having on neuroscience
research.

The efficient and selective removal of apoptotic cells is an important feature of
tissue development, homeostasis and pathology. In the nervous system, synapses
and distal axons are selectively eliminated as part of the remodelling that
underpins development and pathology, through a process that has some features in 
common with apoptotic cell removal. Components of the complement cascade are
implicated in the efficient removal of apoptotic cells outside the nervous
system, and recent evidence suggests that the complement components C1q and C3
have a role in the selective tagging of supernumerary synapses in the developing 
visual system and in their efficient removal by as yet unidentified cells.

The genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely elusive
despite early successes in identifying three genes that cause early-onset
familial AD (those that encode amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the
presenilins (PSEN1 and PSEN2)), and one genetic risk factor for late-onset AD
(the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (APOE)). A large number of studies that
aimed to help uncover the remaining disease-related loci have been published in
recent decades, collectively proposing or refuting the involvement of over 500
different gene candidates. Systematic meta-analyses of these studies currently
highlight more than 20 loci that have modest but significant effects on AD risk. 
This Review discusses the putative pathogenetic roles and common biochemical
pathways of some of the most genetically and biologically compelling of these
potential AD risk factors.

Over the past decade or so, CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) 
peptides have emerged as major neurotransmitters and hormones. CART peptides are 
widely distributed in the CNS and are involved in regulating many processes,
including food intake and the maintenance of body weight, reward and endocrine
functions. Recent studies have produced a wealth of information about the
location, regulation, processing and functions of CART peptides, but additional
studies aimed at elucidating the physiological effects of the peptides and at
characterizing the CART receptor(s) are needed to take advantage of possible
therapeutic applications.

Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating of the psychiatric
disorders. Studies have shown that cognitive therapy is as efficacious as
antidepressant medication at treating depression, and it seems to reduce the risk
of relapse even after its discontinuation. Cognitive therapy and antidepressant
medication probably engage some similar neural mechanisms, as well as mechanisms 
that are distinctive to each. A precise specification of these mechanisms might
one day be used to guide treatment selection and improve outcomes.

accurately and quickly. High-content assays that are applicable to neuroscience
include those that can quantify various aspects of dendritic trees, protein
aggregation, transcription factor translocation, neurotransmitter receptor
internalization, neuron and synapse number, cell migration, proliferation and
apoptosis. The data that are generated by HCA are rich and multiplexed. HCA thus

Distinct human neurodegenerative diseases share remarkably similar temporal
emergence patterns, even though different toxic proteins are involved in their
onset. Typically, familial neurodegenerative diseases emerge during the fifth
decade of life, whereas sporadic cases do not exhibit symptoms earlier than the
seventh decade. Recently, mechanistic links between the aging process and toxic
protein aggregation, a common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, have been
revealed. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signalling pathway - a 
lifespan, metabolism and stress-resistance regulator - links neurodegeneration to
the aging process. Thus, although a reduction of insulin signalling can result in
diabetes, its reduction can also increase longevity and delay the onset of
protein-aggregation-mediated toxicity. Here we review this apparent paradox and
delineate the therapeutic potential of manipulating the insulin/IGF1 signalling
pathway for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Neuropathological changes in Parkinson's disease progress slowly and spread
according to a characteristic pattern. Recent papers have shed light on this
progression of pathology by examining the fate of neurons grafted into the brains
of patients with Parkinson's disease. Two of these studies demonstrate that
grafted healthy neurons can gradually develop the same pathology as host neurons 
in the diseased brains. According to these studies, implanted neurons developed
alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy bodies more than a decade after
transplantation. We discuss the possible underlying mechanisms and their
implications for how pathology spreads in Parkinson's disease.

Research that combines genetic and cognitive neuroscience data aims to elucidate

'intermediate phenotypes': variations in brain function. Using neuroimaging and
other methods, this approach is poised to make the transition from health-focused
investigations to inquiries into cognitive, affective and social functions,
including ones that do not readily lend themselves to animal models. The growing 
pains of this emerging field are evident, yet there are also reasons for a
measured optimism.

Computational neuroscience combines theory and experiment to shed light on the
principles and mechanisms of neural computation. This approach has been highly
fruitful in the ongoing effort to understand velocity computation by the primate 
visual system. This Review describes the success of spatiotemporal-energy models 
in representing local-velocity detection. It shows why local-velocity
measurements tend to differ from the velocity of the object as a whole. Certain
cells in the middle temporal area are thought to solve this problem by combining 
local-velocity estimates to compute the overall pattern velocity. The Review
discusses different models for how this might occur and experiments that test
these models. Although no model is yet firmly established, evidence suggests that
computing pattern velocity from local-velocity estimates involves simple
operations in the spatiotemporal frequency domain.

The immense range of human behaviours is rooted in the complex neural networks of
the cerebrum. The creation of these networks depends on the precise integration
of specific neuronal subtypes that are born in different regions of the
telencephalon. Here, using the mouse as a model system, we review how these
proliferative zones are established. Moreover, we discuss how these regions can
be traced back in development to the function of a few key genes, including those
that encode fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), paired box 6 (PAX6) and
LIM homeobox protein 2 (LHX2), that pattern the early telencephalon.

For centuries people have aspired to understand and control the functions of the 
mind and brain. It has now become possible to image the functioning of the human 
brain in real time using functional MRI (fMRI), and thereby to access both sides 
of the mind-brain interface--subjective experience (that is, one's mind) and
objective observations (that is, external, quantitative measurements of one's
brain activity)--simultaneously. Developments in neuroimaging are now being
translated into many new potential practical applications, including the reading 
of brain states, brain-computer interfaces, communicating with locked-in
patients, lie detection, and learning control over brain activation to modulate
cognition or even treat disease.

Computational neuroscience models can be used to understand the diminished
stability and noisy neurodynamical behaviour of prefrontal cortex networks in
schizophrenia. These neurodynamical properties can be captured by simulated
neural networks with randomly spiking neurons that introduce noise into the
system and produce trial-by-trial variation of postsynaptic potentials.
Theoretical and experimental studies have aimed to understand schizophrenia in
relation to noise and signal-to-noise ratio, which are promising concepts for
understanding the symptoms that characterize this heterogeneous illness.
Simulations of biologically realistic neural networks show how the functioning of
NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and dopamine
receptors is connected to the concepts of noise and variability, and to related
neurophysiological findings and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.

L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) remains the most effective drug for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, chronic use causes dyskinesia, a
complex motor phenomenon that consists of two components: the execution of
involuntary movements in response to drug administration, and the 'priming'
phenomenon that underlies these movements' establishment and persistence. A
reinterpretation of recent data suggests that priming for dyskinesia results from
nigral denervation and the loss of striatal dopamine input, which alters
glutamatergic synaptic connectivity in the striatum. The subsequent response of
the abnormal basal ganglia to dopaminergic drugs determines the manner and timing
of dyskinesia expression. The combination of nigral denervation and drug
treatment establishes inappropriate signalling between the motor cortex and the
striatum, leading to persistent dyskinesia.

Our brains and minds are shaped by our experiences, which mainly occur in the
context of the culture in which we develop and live. Although psychologists have 
provided abundant evidence for diversity of human cognition and behaviour across 
cultures, the question of whether the neural correlates of human cognition are
also culture-dependent is often not considered by neuroscientists. However,
recent transcultural neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that one's cultural
background can influence the neural activity that underlies both high- and
low-level cognitive functions. The findings provide a novel approach by which to 
distinguish culture-sensitive from culture-invariant neural mechanisms of human
cognition.

The contribution of the parietal cortex to episodic memory is a fascinating
scientific puzzle. On the one hand, parietal lesions do not normally yield severe
episodic-memory deficits; on the other hand, parietal activations are seen
frequently in functional-neuroimaging studies of episodic memory. A review of
these two categories of evidence suggests that the answer to the puzzle requires 
us to distinguish between the contributions of dorsal and ventral parietal
regions and between the influence of top-down and bottom-up attention on memory.

In the visual system of primates, different neuronal pathways are specialized for
processing information about the spatial coordinates of objects and their
identity - that is, 'where' and 'what'. By contrast, rats and other nocturnal
animals build up a neuronal representation of 'where' and 'what' by seeking out
and palpating objects with their whiskers. We present recent evidence about how
the brain constructs a representation of the surrounding world through
whisker-mediated sense of touch. While considerable knowledge exists about the
representation of the physical properties of stimuli - like texture, shape and
position - we know little about how the brain represents their meaning. Future
research may elucidate this and show how the transformation of one representation
to another is achieved.

Our movements can hinder our ability to sense the world. Movements can induce
sensory input (for example, when you hit something) that is indistinguishable
from the input that is caused by external agents (for example, when something
hits you). It is critical for nervous systems to be able to differentiate between
these two scenarios. A ubiquitous strategy is to route copies of movement
commands to sensory structures. These signals, which are referred to as corollary
discharge (CD), influence sensory processing in myriad ways. Here we review the
CD circuits that have been uncovered by neurophysiological studies and suggest a 
functional taxonomic classification of CD across the animal kingdom. This broad
understanding of CD circuits lays the groundwork for more challenging studies
that combine neurophysiology and psychophysics to probe the role of CD in
perception.

Personalized medication that is based on pharmacogenetic data has long been
expected to improve the efficacy of treatments for neurological and psychiatric
disorders, including depression. However, the complexity of the regulation of
gene transcription and its interactions with environmental factors means that
straightforward translation of individual genetic information into tailored
treatment is unlikely. Nevertheless, when data from genomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, neuroimaging and neuroendocrinology are used in combination, they
could lead to the development of effective personalized antidepressant treatment 
that is based on both genotypes and biomarkers. This process will require many
further steps and collaboration between basic and clinical neuroscience.

Epilepsy is a complex set of disorders that can involve many areas of the cortex,
as well as underlying deep-brain systems. The myriad manifestations of seizures, 
which can be as varied as déjà vu and olfactory hallucination, can therefore give
researchers insights into regional functions and relations. Epilepsy is also
complex genetically and pathophysiologically: it involves microscopic (on the
scale of ion channels and synaptic proteins), macroscopic (on the scale of brain 
trauma and rewiring) and intermediate changes in a complex interplay of
causality. It has long been recognized that computer modelling will be required
to disentangle causality, to better understand seizure spread and to understand
and eventually predict treatment efficacy. Over the past few years, substantial
progress has been made in modelling epilepsy at levels ranging from the molecular
to the socioeconomic. We review these efforts and connect them to the medical
goals of understanding and treating the disorder.

It has long been suspected that the relative abundance of specific nutrients can 
affect cognitive processes and emotions. Newly described influences of dietary
factors on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity have revealed some of the
vital mechanisms that are responsible for the action of diet on brain health and 
mental function. Several gut hormones that can enter the brain, or that are
produced in the brain itself, influence cognitive ability. In addition,
well-established regulators of synaptic plasticity, such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, can function as metabolic modulators, responding to
peripheral signals such as food intake. Understanding the molecular basis of the 
effects of food on cognition will help us to determine how best to manipulate
diet in order to increase the resistance of neurons to insults and promote mental
fitness.

Neuroscience produces a vast amount of data from an enormous diversity of
neurons. A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and 
the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the
unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron
from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying 
cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of
researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological 
and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The
resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future
classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will
be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the
active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic evolution
of this project.

Insoluble protein aggregates have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recent work in transgenic mice has shed light on
the role of these aggregates by identifying soluble oligomeric species that may
interfere with essential cellular mechanisms at an early disease stage. This
review summarizes what we have learned about the roles of these proteins from
transgenic mice and invertebrate species such as flies and worms. Proteomic and
transcriptomic analyses of tissue from these animal models have identified new
molecules with crucial roles in disease. Moreover, transgenic animals have been
instrumental in defining drug targets and designing novel therapeutic strategies.
With advanced imaging techniques that can be used in both humans and mice an
early, preclinical diagnosis of AD and FTD could be within reach.

Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that migrate, divide and fuse.
Cycles of mitochondrial fission and fusion ensure metabolite and mitochondrial
DNA mixing and dictate organelle shape, number and bioenergetic functionality.
There is mounting evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and causal 
event in neurodegeneration. Mutations in the mitochondrial fusion GTPases
mitofusin 2 and optic atrophy 1, neurotoxins and oxidative stress all disrupt the
cable-like morphology of functional mitochondria. This results in impaired
bioenergetics and mitochondrial migration, and can trigger neurodegeneration.
These findings suggest potential new treatment avenues for neurodegenerative
diseases.

Neuroeconomics is the study of the neurobiological and computational basis of
value-based decision making. Its goal is to provide a biologically based account 
of human behaviour that can be applied in both the natural and the social
sciences. This Review proposes a framework to investigate different aspects of
the neurobiology of decision making. The framework allows us to bring together
recent findings in the field, highlight some of the most important outstanding
problems, define a common lexicon that bridges the different disciplines that
inform neuroeconomics, and point the way to future applications.

Systemic osmoregulation is a vital process whereby changes in plasma osmolality, 
detected by osmoreceptors, modulate ingestive behaviour, sympathetic outflow and 
renal function to stabilize the tonicity and volume of the extracellular fluid.
Furthermore, changes in the central processing of osmosensory signals are likely 
to affect the hydro-mineral balance and other related aspects of homeostasis,
including thermoregulation and cardiovascular balance. Surprisingly little is
known about how the brain orchestrates these responses. Here, recent advances in 
our understanding of the molecular, cellular and network mechanisms that mediate 
the central control of osmotic homeostasis in mammals are reviewed.

Experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that activating the immune
system in the CNS can be destructive. However, other studies have shown that
enhancing an immune response can be therapeutic, and several clinical trials have
been initiated with the aim of boosting immune responses in the CNS of
individuals with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. 
Here, we evaluate the controversies in the field and discuss the remaining
scientific challenges that are associated with enhancing immune function in the
CNS to treat neurological diseases.

Micturition, or urination, occurs involuntarily in infants and young children
until the age of 3 to 5 years, after which it is regulated voluntarily. The
neural circuitry that controls this process is complex and highly distributed: it
involves pathways at many levels of the brain, the spinal cord and the peripheral
nervous system and is mediated by multiple neurotransmitters. Diseases or
injuries of the nervous system in adults can cause the re-emergence of
involuntary or reflex micturition, leading to urinary incontinence. This is a
major health problem, especially in those with neurological impairment. Here we
review the neural control of micturition and how disruption of this control leads
to abnormal storage and release of urine.

Schizophrenia is a highly debilitating mental disorder that affects approximately
1% of the general population, yet it continues to be poorly understood. Recent
studies have identified variations in several genes that are associated with this
disorder in diverse populations, including those that encode neuregulin 1 (NRG1) 
and its receptor ErbB4. The past few years have witnessed exciting progress in
our knowledge of NRG1 and ErbB4 functions and the biological basis of the
increased risk for schizophrenia that is potentially conferred by polymorphisms
in the two genes. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which altered
function of NRG1 and ErbB4 contributes to schizophrenia might eventually lead to 
the development of more effective therapeutics.

Perceptual decision making is the act of choosing one option or course of action 
from a set of alternatives on the basis of available sensory evidence. Thus, when
we make such decisions, sensory information must be interpreted and translated
into behaviour. Neurophysiological work in monkeys performing sensory
discriminations, combined with computational modelling, has paved the way for
neuroimaging studies that are aimed at understanding decision-related processes
in the human brain. Here we review findings from human neuroimaging studies in
conjunction with data analysis methods that can directly link decisions and
signals in the human brain on a trial-by-trial basis. This leads to a new view
about the neural basis of human perceptual decision-making processes.

Glutamate acts on postsynaptic glutamate receptors to mediate excitatory
communication between neurons. The discovery that additional presynaptic
glutamate receptors can modulate neurotransmitter release has added complexity to
the way we view glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Here we review evidence of a
physiological role for presynaptic glutamate receptors in neurotransmitter
release. We compare the physiological roles of ionotropic and metabotropic
glutamate receptors in short- and long-term regulation of synaptic transmission. 
Furthermore, we discuss the physiological conditions that are necessary for their
activation, the source of the glutamate that activates them, their mechanisms of 
action and their involvement in higher brain function.

A central aim of neuroscience is to map neural circuits, in order to learn how
they account for mental activities and behaviours and how alterations in them
lead to neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the methods that are
currently available for visualizing circuits have severe limitations that make it
extremely difficult to extract precise wiring diagrams from histological images. 
Here we review recent advances in this area, along with some of the opportunities
that these advances present and the obstacles that remain.

The mechanisms through which general anaesthetics, an extremely diverse group of 
drugs, cause reversible loss of consciousness have been a long-standing mystery. 
Gradually, a relatively small number of important molecular targets have emerged,
and how these drugs act at the molecular level is becoming clearer. Finding the
link between these molecular studies and anaesthetic-induced loss of
consciousness presents an enormous challenge, but comparisons with the features
of natural sleep are helping us to understand how these drugs work and the
neuronal pathways that they affect. Recent work suggests that the thalamus and
the neuronal networks that regulate its activity are the key to understanding how
anaesthetics cause loss of consciousness.

The input-output relationship of neuronal networks depends both on their synaptic
connectivity and on the intrinsic properties of their neuronal elements. In
addition to altered synaptic properties, profound changes in intrinsic neuronal
properties are observed in many CNS disorders. These changes reflect alterations 
in the functional properties of dendritic and somatic voltage- and Ca2+-gated ion
channels. The molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic plasticity comprise 
the highly specific transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of
ion-channel expression, trafficking and function. The studies reviewed here show 
that intrinsic plasticity, in conjunction with synaptic plasticity, can
fundamentally alter the input-output properties of neuronal networks in CNS
disorders.

Synapse regulation exploits the capacity of actin to function as a stable
structural component or as a dynamic filament. Beyond its well-appreciated role
in eliciting visible morphological changes at the synapse, the emerging picture
points to an active contribution of actin to the modulation of the efficacy of
pre- and postsynaptic terminals. Moreover, by engaging distinct pools of actin
and divergent signalling pathways, actin-dependent morphological plasticity could
be uncoupled from modulation of synaptic strength. The aim of this Review is to
highlight some of the recent progress in elucidating the role of the actin
cytoskeleton in synaptic function.

Synaptic plasticity is a key component of the learning machinery in the brain. It
is vital that such plasticity be tightly regulated so that it occurs to the
proper extent at the proper time. Activity-dependent mechanisms that have been
collectively termed metaplasticity have evolved to help implement these essential
computational constraints. Various intercellular signalling molecules can trigger
lasting changes in the ability of synapses to express plasticity; their
mechanisms of action are reviewed here, along with a consideration of how

GABA(A) receptor trafficking and its role in the dynamic modulation of neuronal
inhibition.

GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate most fast
synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain, controlling activity at both the
network and the cellular levels. The diverse functions of GABA in the CNS are
matched not just by the heterogeneity of GABA(A)Rs, but also by the complex
trafficking mechanisms and protein-protein interactions that generate and
maintain an appropriate receptor cell-surface localization. In this Review, we
discuss recent progress in our understanding of the dynamic regulation of
GABA(A)R composition, trafficking to and from the neuronal surface, and lateral
movement of receptors between synaptic and extrasynaptic locations. Finally, we
highlight a number of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and
schizophrenia, in which alterations in GABA(A)R trafficking occur.

Pain and pleasure are powerful motivators of behaviour and have historically been
considered opposites. Emerging evidence from the pain and reward research fields 
points to extensive similarities in the anatomical substrates of painful and
pleasant sensations. Recent molecular-imaging and animal studies have
demonstrated the important role of the opioid and dopamine systems in modulating 
both pain and pleasure. Understanding the mutually inhibitory effects that pain
and reward processing have on each other, and the neural mechanisms that underpin
such modulation, is important for alleviating unnecessary suffering and improving
well-being.

The term 'social brain' refers to the network of brain regions that are involved 
in understanding others. Behaviour that is related to social cognition changes
dramatically during human adolescence. This is paralleled by functional changes
that occur in the social brain during this time, in particular in the medial
prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, which show altered activity
during the performance of social cognitive tasks, such as face recognition and
mental-state attribution. Research also indicates that, in humans, these parts of
the social brain undergo structural development, including synaptic
reorganization, during adolescence. Bringing together two relatively new and
rapidly expanding areas of neuroscience--social neuroscience and the study of
brain development during adolescence--will increase our understanding of how the 
social brain develops during adolescence.

For thousands of years science philosophers have been impressed by how
effectively the senses work together to enhance the salience of biologically
meaningful events. However, they really had no idea how this was accomplished.
Recent insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms reveal that, in at
least one circuit, this ability depends on an intimate dialogue among neurons at 
multiple levels of the neuraxis; this dialogue cannot take place until long after
birth and might require a specific kind of experience. Understanding the
acquisition and usage of multisensory integration in the midbrain and cerebral
cortex of mammals has been aided by a multiplicity of approaches. Here we examine
some of the fundamental advances that have been made and some of the challenging 
questions that remain.

A striking way in which humans differ from non-human primates is in their ability
to represent numerical quantity using abstract symbols and to use these 'mental
tools' to perform skills such as exact calculations. How do functional brain
circuits for the symbolic representation of numerical magnitude emerge? Do neural
representations of numerical magnitude change as a function of development and
the learning of mental arithmetic? Current theories suggest that cultural number 
symbols acquire their meaning by being mapped onto non-symbolic representations
of numerical magnitude. This Review provides an evaluation of this contention and
proposes hypotheses to guide investigations into the neural mechanisms that
constrain the acquisition of cultural representations of numerical magnitude.

Noise--random disturbances of signals--poses a fundamental problem for
information processing and affects all aspects of nervous-system function.
However, the nature, amount and impact of noise in the nervous system have only
recently been addressed in a quantitative manner. Experimental and computational 
methods have shown that multiple noise sources contribute to cellular and
behavioural trial-to-trial variability. We review the sources of noise in the
nervous system, from the molecular to the behavioural level, and show how noise
contributes to trial-to-trial variability. We highlight how noise affects
neuronal networks and the principles the nervous system applies to counter
detrimental effects of noise, and briefly discuss noise's potential benefits.

The intricate neuronal circuitry of the cerebellum is thought to encode internal 
models that reproduce the dynamic properties of body parts. These models are
essential for controlling the movement of these body parts: they allow the brain 
to precisely control the movement without the need for sensory feedback. It is
thought that the cerebellum might also encode internal models that reproduce the 
essential properties of mental representations in the cerebral cortex. This
hypothesis suggests a possible mechanism by which intuition and implicit thought 
might function and explains some of the symptoms that are exhibited by
psychiatric patients. This article examines the conceptual bases and experimental
evidence for this hypothesis.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated a role for state-of-the-art
neuroimaging methods in the assessment of patients in the vegetative state and
other so-called 'disorders of consciousness'. In several cases, functional MRI
has been used to show that aspects of speech perception, emotional processing,
language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in some
patients who behaviourally meet all of the criteria that define the vegetative
state. This work has profound implications for clinical care, diagnosis,
prognosis and medical-legal decision making (relating to the prolongation, or
otherwise, of life after severe brain injury), as well as for more basic
scientific questions about the nature of consciousness and the neural
representation of our own thoughts and intentions.

Dystonias comprise a group of movement disorders that are characterized by
involuntary movements and postures. Insight into the nature of neuronal
dysfunction has been provided by the identification of genes responsible for
primary dystonias, the characterization of animal models and functional
evaluations and in vivo brain imaging of patients with dystonia. The data suggest
that alterations in neuronal development and communication within the brain
create a susceptible substratum for dystonia. Although there is no overt
neurodegeneration in most forms of dystonia, there are functional and
microstructural brain alterations. Dystonia offers a window into the mechanisms
whereby subtle changes in neuronal function, particularly in sensorimotor
circuits that are associated with motor learning and memory, can corrupt normal
coordination and lead to a disabling motor disorder.

Pyramidal neurons are characterized by their distinct apical and basal dendritic 
trees and the pyramidal shape of their soma. They are found in several regions of
the CNS and, although the reasons for their abundance remain unclear, functional 
studies--especially of CA1 hippocampal and layer V neocortical pyramidal
neurons--have offered insights into the functions of their unique cellular
architecture. Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional
principles can be identified. In particular, the existence of dendritic domains
with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to
be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to
contribute to action-potential generation. These properties support a variety of 
coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic
integration and plasticity.

The hippocampus appears to be crucial for long-term episodic memory, yet its
precise role remains elusive. Electrophysiological studies in rodents offer a
useful starting point for developing models of hippocampal processing in the
spatial domain. Here we review one such model that points to an essential role
for the hippocampus in the construction of mental images. We explain how this
neural-level mechanistic account addresses some of the current controversies in
the field, such as the role of the hippocampus in imagery and short-term memory, 
and discuss its broader implications for the neural bases of episodic memory.

The appeal of in vivo cellular imaging to any neuroscientist is not hard to
understand: it is almost impossible to isolate individual neurons while keeping
them and their complex interactions with surrounding tissue intact. These
interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural
computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and
consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in
reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time
resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what 
can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only
accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the 
design of molecular contrast agents.

It is anticipated that by 2040 neurodegeneration will affect 40 million people
worldwide, more than twice as many as today. The traditional neurocentric view
holds that neurodegeneration is caused primarily by intrinsic neuronal defects.
However, recent evidence indicates that the millions of blood vessels that
criss-cross the nervous system might not be the silent bystanders they were
originally considered. Indeed, recent genetic studies reveal that insufficient
production of angiogenic signals, which stimulate the growth of blood vessels,
can cause neurodegeneration. Remarkably, some angiogenic factors can also
regulate neuroregeneration, and have direct neuroprotective and other effects on 
various neural cell types. Here we provide an overview of the molecules that
affect both neural and vascular cell processes--to underline their duality, we
term them angioneurins. Unravelling the molecular mechanisms by which these
angioneurins act might create opportunities for developing new neurovascular
medicine.

The current view of brain organization supports the notion that there is a
considerable degree of functional specialization and that many regions can be
conceptualized as either 'affective' or 'cognitive'. Popular examples are the
amygdala in the domain of emotion and the lateral prefrontal cortex in the case
of cognition. This prevalent view is problematic for a number of reasons. Here, I
will argue that complex cognitive-emotional behaviours have their basis in
dynamic coalitions of networks of brain areas, none of which should be
conceptualized as specifically affective or cognitive. Central to
cognitive-emotional interactions are brain areas with a high degree of
connectivity, called hubs, which are critical for regulating the flow and
integration of information between regions.

Higher-order actin-based networks (actin superstructures) are important for
growth-cone motility and guidance. Principles for generating, organizing and
remodelling actin superstructures have emerged from recent findings in cell-free 
systems, non-neuronal cells and growth cones. This Review examines how actin
superstructures are initiated de novo at the leading-edge membrane and how the
spontaneous organization of actin superstructures is driven by ensembles of
actin-binding proteins. How the regulation of actin-binding proteins can affect
growth-cone turning and axonal regeneration is also discussed.

of the CNS, derived from observations on the human embryonic cerebrum. Since
then, numerous studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of the timing,
sequence and complexity of developmental events, and revealed important
inter-species differences. We review current data on the development of the human
cerebral cortex and update the classical model of how the structure that makes us
human is formed.

Mutations resulting in reduced or completely abrogated serotonin-transporter
(SERT) function in mice have led to the identification of more than 50 different 
phenotypic changes, ranging from increased anxiety and stress-related behaviours 
to gut dysfunction, bone weakness and late-onset obesity with metabolic syndrome.
These multiple effects, which can be amplified by gene-environment and gene-gene 
interactions, are primarily attributable to altered intracellular and
extracellular serotonin concentrations during development and adulthood. Much of 
the human data relating to altered expression of the gene that encodes SERT are
based on genetic-association findings or correlations and are therefore not as
robust as the experimental mouse results. Nevertheless, SERT-function-modifying
gene variants in humans apparently produce many phenotypes that are similar to
those that manifest themselves in mice.

Neuroimaging research over the past decade has revealed a detailed picture of the
functional organization of the human brain. Here we focus on two fundamental
questions that are raised by the detailed mapping of sensory and cognitive
functions and illustrate these questions with findings from the object-vision
pathway. First, are functionally specific regions that are located close together
best understood as distinct cortical modules or as parts of a larger-scale
cortical map? Second, what functional properties define each cortical map or
module? We propose a model in which overlapping continuous maps of simple
features give rise to discrete modules that are selective for complex stimuli.

A train of action potentials (a spike train) can carry information in both the
average firing rate and the pattern of spikes in the train. But can such a
spike-pattern code be supported by cortical circuits? Neurons in vitro produce a 
spike pattern in response to the injection of a fluctuating current. However,
cortical neurons in vivo are modulated by local oscillatory neuronal activity and
by top-down inputs. In a cortical circuit, precise spike patterns thus reflect
the interaction between internally generated activity and sensory information
encoded by input spike trains. We review the evidence for precise and reliable
spike timing in the cortex and discuss its computational role.

Two facts about the hippocampus have been common currency among neuroscientists
for several decades. First, lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the
acquisition of new episodic memories; second, activity-dependent synaptic
plasticity is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses. Given this background,
the hypothesis that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part,
by hippocampal synaptic plasticity has seemed as cogent in theory as it has been 
difficult to prove in practice. Here we argue that the recent development of
transgenic molecular devices will encourage a shift from mechanistic
investigations of synaptic plasticity in single neurons towards an analysis of
how networks of neurons encode and represent memory, and we suggest ways in which
this might be achieved. In the process, the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity
is necessary and sufficient for information storage in the brain may finally be
validated.

An emerging body of multidisciplinary literature has documented the beneficial
influence of physical activity engendered through aerobic exercise on selective
aspects of brain function. Human and non-human animal studies have shown that
aerobic exercise can improve a number of aspects of cognition and performance.
Lack of physical activity, particularly among children in the developed world, is
one of the major causes of obesity. Exercise might not only help to improve their
physical health, but might also improve their academic performance. This article 
examines the positive effects of aerobic physical activity on cognition and brain
function, at the molecular, cellular, systems and behavioural levels. A growing
number of studies support the idea that physical exercise is a lifestyle factor
that might lead to increased physical and mental health throughout life.

Neurons have a constantly high glucose demand, and unlike muscle cells they
cannot accommodate episodic glucose uptake under the influence of insulin.
Neuronal glucose uptake depends on the extracellular concentration of glucose,
and cellular damage can ensue after persistent episodes of hyperglycaemia--a
phenomenon referred to as glucose neurotoxicity. This article reviews the
pathophysiological manifestation of raised glucose in neurons and how this can
explain the major components of diabetic neuropathy.

A successful pregnancy requires multiple adaptations of the mother's physiology
to optimize fetal growth and development, to protect the fetus from adverse
programming, to provide impetus for timely parturition and to ensure that
adequate maternal care is provided after parturition. Many of these adaptations
are organized by the mother's brain, predominantly through changes in
neuroendocrine systems, and these changes are primarily driven by the hormones of
pregnancy. By contrast, adaptations in the mother's brain during lactation are
maintained by external stimuli from the young. The changes in pregnancy are not
necessarily innocuous: they may predispose the mother to post-partum mood
disorders.

In response to a peripheral infection, innate immune cells produce
pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on the brain to cause sickness behaviour.
When activation of the peripheral immune system continues unabated, such as
during systemic infections, cancer or autoimmune diseases, the ensuing immune
signalling to the brain can lead to an exacerbation of sickness and the
development of symptoms of depression in vulnerable individuals. These phenomena 
might account for the increased prevalence of clinical depression in physically
ill people. Inflammation is therefore an important biological event that might
increase the risk of major depressive episodes, much like the more traditional
psychosocial factors.

Polysialic acid (PSA) is a cell-surface glycan with an enormous hydrated volume
that serves to modulate the distance between cells. This regulation has direct
effects on several cellular mechanisms that underlie the formation of the
vertebrate nervous system, most conspicuously in the migration and
differentiation of progenitor cells and the growth and targeting of axons. PSA is
also involved in a number of plasticity-related responses in the adult CNS,
including changes in circadian and hormonal patterns, adaptations to pain and
stress, and aspects of learning and memory. The ability of PSA to increase the
plasticity of neural cells is being exploited to improve the repair of adult CNS 
tissue.

Mr M, a patient with semantic dementia--a neurodegenerative disease that is
characterized by the gradual deterioration of semantic memory--was being driven
through the countryside to visit a friend and was able to remind his wife where
to turn along the not-recently-travelled route. Then, pointing at the sheep in
the field, he asked her "What are those things?" Prior to the onset of symptoms
in his late 40s, this man had normal semantic memory. What has gone wrong in his 
brain to produce this dramatic and selective erosion of conceptual knowledge?

Charles Darwin appreciated the conceptual difficulty in accepting that an organ
as wonderful as the vertebrate eye could have evolved through natural selection. 
He reasoned that if appropriate gradations could be found that were useful to the
animal and were inherited, then the apparent difficulty would be overcome. Here, 
we review a wide range of findings that capture glimpses of the gradations that
appear to have occurred during eye evolution, and provide a scenario for the
unseen steps that have led to the emergence of the vertebrate eye.

Our understanding of how the enormously complex task of interconnecting millions 
of nerve cells is accomplished remains rudimentary. What molecular mechanisms
control its exquisite specificity? Can we pinpoint single molecular interactions 
that might help to explain some of the specificity requirements that underlie
neuronal wiring? A series of recent studies on the molecular diversity of the
Drosophila melanogaster cell-surface receptor Down syndrome cell-adhesion
molecule (Dscam) provide one exceptional example of a novel mechanistic model of 
neuronal-wiring specificity, progressing from structural studies of single
protein-protein interactions to biochemical analysis in vitro and to an
understanding of complex neuronal differentiation at the single-cell or tissue
levels.

Traditionally, glutamate transporters have been viewed as membrane proteins that 
harness the electrochemical gradient to slowly transport glutamate from the
extracellular space into glial cells. However, recent studies have shown that
glutamate transporters on glial and neuronal membranes also rapidly bind released
glutamate to shape synaptic transmission. In this Review, we summarize the
properties of glutamate transporters that influence synaptic transmission and are
subject to regulation and plasticity. We highlight how the diversity of
glutamate-transporter function relates to transporter location, density and
affinity.

Post-translational protein modifications are integral components of signalling
cascades that enable cells to efficiently, rapidly and reversibly respond to
extracellular stimuli. These modifications have crucial roles in the CNS, where
the communication between neurons is particularly complex. SUMOylation is a
post-translational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like
modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine residues in target
proteins. It is well established that SUMOylation controls many aspects of
nuclear function, but it is now clear that it is also a key determinant in many
extranuclear neuronal processes, and it has also been implicated in a wide range 
of neuropathological conditions.

Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of membrane
transport proteins that have been shown to be sensitive to the abundance of
phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane. These proteins include voltage-gated
potassium and calcium channels, ion channels that mediate sensory and nociceptive
responses, epithelial transport proteins and ionic exchangers. Each of the
regulatory lipids is also under multifaceted regulatory control. Phosphoinositide
modulation of membrane proteins in neurons often has a dramatic effect on
neuronal excitability and synaptic transmitter release. The repertoire of lipid
signalling mechanisms that regulate membrane proteins is intriguingly complex and
provides a rich array of topics for neuroscience research.

Chemokines are not only found in the immune system or expressed in inflammatory
conditions: they are constitutively present in the brain in both glial cells and 
neurons. Recently, the possibility has been raised that they might act as
neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Although the evidence is incomplete,
emerging data show that chemokines have several of the characteristics that
define neurotransmitters. Moreover, their physiological actions resemble those of
neuromodulators in the sense that chemokines usually have few effects by
themselves in basal conditions, but modify the induced release of
neurotransmitters or neuropeptides. These findings, together with the
pharmacological development of agonists and antagonists that are selective for
chemokine receptors and can cross the blood-brain barrier, open a new era of
research in neuroscience.

Recognition memory is widely viewed as consisting of two components, recollection
and familiarity, which have been proposed to be dependent on the hippocampus and 
the adjacent perirhinal cortex, respectively. Here, we propose an alternative
perspective: we suggest that the methods traditionally used to separate
recollection from familiarity instead separate strong memories from weak
memories. A review of work with humans, monkeys and rodents finds evidence for
familiarity signals (as well as recollection signals) in the hippocampus and
recollection signals (as well as familiarity signals) in the perirhinal cortex.
We also indicate ways in which the functions of the medial temporal lobe
structures are different, and suggest that these structures work together in a
cooperative and complementary way.

The cranial motor nerves control muscles involved in eye, head and neck
movements, feeding, speech and facial expression. The generic and specific
properties of cranial motor neurons depend on a matrix of rostrocaudal and
dorsoventral patterning information. Repertoires of transcription factors,
including Hox genes, confer generic and specific properties on motor neurons, and
endow subpopulations at various axial levels with the ability to navigate to
their targets. Cranial motor axon projections are guided by diffusible cues and
aided by guideposts, such as nerve exit points, glial cells and muscle primordia.
The recent identification of genes that are mutated in human cranial
dysinnervation disorders is now shedding light on the functional consequences of 
perturbations of cranial motor neuron development.

Addiction is caused, in part, by powerful and long-lasting memories of the drug
experience. Relapse caused by exposure to cues associated with the drug
experience is a major clinical problem that contributes to the persistence of
addiction. Here we present the accumulated evidence that drugs of abuse can
hijack synaptic plasticity mechanisms in key brain circuits, most importantly in 
the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is central to reward processing in the
brain. Reversing or preventing these drug-induced synaptic modifications may
prove beneficial in the treatment of one of society's most intractable health
problems.

In a small fraction of mammalian genes--at present estimated at less than 1% of
the total--one of the two alleles that is inherited by the offspring is partially
or completely switched off. The decision as to which one is silenced depends on
which allele was inherited from the mother and which from the father. These
idiosyncratic loci are known as imprinted genes, and their existence is an
evolutionary enigma, as they effectively nullify the advantages of diploidy.
Although they are small in number, these genes have important effects on
physiology and behaviour, and many are expressed in the brain. There is
increasing evidence that imprinted genes influence brain function and behaviour
by affecting neurodevelopmental processes.

Cannabis has been known for at least 4,000 years to have profound effects on the 
mind--effects that have provoked dramatically divergent attitudes towards it.
Some societies have regarded cannabis as a sacred boon for mankind that offers
respite from the tribulations of everyday life, whereas others have demonized it 
as inevitably leading to 'reefer madness'. The debate between the protagonists
and prohibitionists has recently been re-ignited, but unfortunately this debate
continues mainly in ignorance of our new understanding of the effects of cannabis
on the brain and of studies that have quantified the extent of the risks of
long-term use.

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing has an important role in the control of neuronal
gene expression. Many neuronal proteins are structurally diversified through the 
differential inclusion and exclusion of sequences in the final spliced mRNA.
Here, we discuss common mechanisms of splicing regulation and provide examples of
how alternative splicing has important roles in neuronal development and mature
neuron function. Finally, we describe regulatory proteins that control the
splicing of some neuronally expressed transcripts.

Many drugs that have been developed to treat neurodegenerative diseases fail to
gain approval for clinical use because they are not well tolerated in humans. In 
this article, I describe a series of strategies for the development of
neuroprotective therapeutics that are both effective and well tolerated. These
strategies are based on the principle that drugs should be activated by the
pathological state that they are intended to inhibit. This approach has already
met with success, and has led to the development of the potentially
neuroprotective drug memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type and glutamate
receptor antagonist.

Biological pacemakers dictate our daily schedules in physiology and behaviour.
The molecules, cells and networks that underlie these circadian rhythms can now
be monitored using long-term cellular imaging and electrophysiological tools, and
initial studies have already suggested a theme--circadian clocks may be crucial
for widespread changes in brain activity and plasticity. These daily changes can 
modify the amount or activity of available genes, transcripts, proteins, ions and
other biologically active molecules, ultimately determining cellular properties
such as excitability and connectivity. Recently discovered circadian molecules
and cells provide preliminary insights into a network that adapts to predictable 
daily and seasonal changes while remaining robust in the face of other
perturbations.

At the end of the 1980s, it was clearly demonstrated that cells produce nitric
oxide and that this gaseous molecule is involved in the regulation of the
cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems, rather than simply being a toxic
pollutant. In the CNS, nitric oxide has an array of functions, such as the
regulation of synaptic plasticity, the sleep-wake cycle and hormone secretion.
Particularly interesting is the role of nitric oxide as a Janus molecule in the
cell death or survival mechanisms in brain cells. In fact, physiological amounts 
of this gas are neuroprotective, whereas higher concentrations are clearly
neurotoxic.

Retinoic acid (RA) is involved in the induction of neural differentiation, motor 
axon outgrowth and neural patterning. Like other developmental molecules, RA
continues to play a role after development has been completed. Elevated RA
signalling in the adult triggers axon outgrowth and, consequently, nerve
regeneration. RA is also involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state 
of adult neurons, and disruption of RA signalling in the adult leads to the
degeneration of motor neurons (motor neuron disease), the development of
Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, the development of Parkinson's disease. The
data described here strongly suggest that RA could be used as a therapeutic
molecule for the induction of axon regeneration and the treatment of
neurodegeneration.

Nerve cells mould the lipid fabric of their membranes to ease vesicle fusion,
regulate ion fluxes and create specialized microenvironments that contribute to
cellular communication. The chemical diversity of membrane lipids controls
protein traffic, facilitates recognition between cells and leads to the
production of hundreds of molecules that carry information both within and across
cells. With so many roles, it is no wonder that lipids make up half of the human 
brain in dry weight. The objective of neural lipidomics is to understand how
these molecules work together; this difficult task will greatly benefit from
technical advances that might enable the testing of emerging hypotheses.

Many cellular functions require the synthesis of a specific protein or functional
cohort of proteins at a specific time and place in the cell. Local protein
synthesis in neuronal dendrites is essential for understanding how neural
activity patterns are transduced into persistent changes in synaptic connectivity
during cortical development, memory storage and other long-term adaptive brain
responses. Regional and temporal changes in protein levels are commonly
coordinated by an asymmetric distribution of mRNAs. This Review attempts to
integrate current knowledge of dendritic mRNA transport, storage and translation,
placing particular emphasis on the coordination of regulation and function during
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.

To date, the diagnosis of mental disorders has been based on clinical
observation, specifically: the identification of symptoms that tend to cluster
together, the timing of the symptoms' appearance, and their tendency to resolve, 
recur or become chronic. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders and the International Classification of Disease, the manuals that
specify these diagnoses and the criteria for making them, are currently
undergoing revision. It is thus timely to ask whether neuroscience has progressed
to the point that the next editions of these manuals can usefully incorporate
information about brain structure and function.

During brain development, one of the most important structures is the
subventricular zone (SVZ), from which most neurons are generated. In adulthood
the SVZ maintains a pool of progenitor cells that continuously replace neurons in
the olfactory bulb. Neurodegenerative diseases induce a substantial upregulation 
or downregulation of SVZ progenitor cell proliferation, depending on the type of 
disorder. Far from being a dormant layer, the SVZ responds to neurodegenerative
disease in a way that makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

The majority of functional neuroscience studies have focused on the brain's
response to a task or stimulus. However, the brain is very active even in the
absence of explicit input or output. In this Article we review recent studies
examining spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
signal of functional magnetic resonance imaging as a potentially important and
revealing manifestation of spontaneous neuronal activity. Although several
challenges remain, these studies have provided insight into the intrinsic
functional architecture of the brain, variability in behaviour and potential
physiological correlates of neurological and psychiatric disease.

Rapid memory formation relies, at least in part, on long-term potentiation (LTP) 
of excitatory synapses. Inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus, which are
essential for information processing, have recently been found to exhibit not
one, but two forms of LTP. One form resembles LTP that occurs in pyramidal
neurons, which depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and is triggered by
coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The other depends on Ca2+ influx
through glutamate receptors that preferentially open when the postsynaptic neuron
is at rest. Here we review these contrasting forms of LTP and describe how they
are mirrored by two forms of long-term depression. We further discuss how the
remarkable plasticity of glutamatergic synapses on interneurons greatly enhances

In many areas of the vertebrate brain, such as the cerebral and cerebellar
cortices, neural circuits rely on inhibition mediated by GABA (gamma-aminobutyric
acid) to shape the spatiotemporal patterns of electrical signalling. The richness
and subtlety of inhibition are achieved by diverse classes of interneurons that
are endowed with distinct physiological properties. In addition, the axons of
interneurons display highly characteristic and class-specific geometry and
innervation patterns, and thereby distribute their output to discrete spatial
domains, cell types and subcellular compartments in neural networks. The cellular
and molecular mechanisms that specify and modify inhibitory innervation patterns 
are only just beginning to be understood.

A rapidly growing number of recent studies show that imagining the future depends
on much of the same neural machinery that is needed for remembering the past.
These findings have led to the concept of the prospective brain; an idea that a
crucial function of the brain is to use stored information to imagine, simulate
and predict possible future events. We suggest that processes such as memory can 
be productively re-conceptualized in light of this idea.

Advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of tau-mediated neurodegeneration
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, which are characterized by
prominent CNS accumulations of fibrillar tau inclusions, are rapidly moving this 
previously underexplored disease pathway to centre stage for disease-modifying
drug discovery efforts. However, controversies abound concerning whether or not
the deleterious effects of tau pathologies result from toxic gains-of-function by
pathological tau or from critical losses of normal tau function in the disease
state. This Review summarizes the most recent advances in our knowledge of the
mechanisms of tau-mediated neurodegeneration to forge an integrated concept of
those tau-linked disease processes that drive the onset and progression of AD and
related tauopathies.

The human body, like the human face, is a rich source of socially relevant
information about other individuals. Evidence from studies of both humans and
non-human primates points to focal regions of the higher-level visual cortex that
are specialized for the visual perception of the body. These body-selective
regions, which can be dissociated from regions involved in face perception, have 
been implicated in the perception of the self and the 'body schema', the
perception of others' emotions and the understanding of actions.

Despite aggressive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, malignant gliomas
remain uniformly fatal. To progress, these tumours stimulate the formation of new
blood vessels through processes driven primarily by vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF). However, the resulting vessels are structurally and functionally
abnormal, and contribute to a hostile microenvironment (low oxygen tension and
high interstitial fluid pressure) that selects for a more malignant phenotype
with increased morbidity and mortality. Emerging preclinical and clinical data
indicate that anti-VEGF therapies are potentially effective in glioblastoma--the 
most frequent primary brain tumour--and can transiently normalize tumour vessels.
This creates a window of opportunity for optimally combining chemotherapeutics
and radiation.

Neuropsychiatric disorders, which arise from a combination of genetic, epigenetic
and environmental influences, epitomize the challenges faced in understanding the
mammalian brain. Elucidation and treatment of these diseases will benefit from
understanding how specific brain cell types are interconnected and signal in
neural circuits. Newly developed neuroengineering tools based on two microbial
opsins, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR), enable the
investigation of neural circuit function with cell-type-specific, temporally
accurate and reversible neuromodulation. These tools could lead to the
development of precise neuromodulation technologies for animal models of disease 
and clinical neuropsychiatry.

From a wealth of experimental findings, derived from both in vitro and in vivo
experiments, it is becoming clear that fibroblast growth factors regulate
processes that are central to all aspects of nervous system development. Some of 
these functions are well known, whereas others, such as the roles of these
proteins in axon guidance and synaptogenesis, have been established only
recently. The emergent picture is one of remarkable economy, in which this family
of ligands is deployed and redeployed at successive developmental stages to
sculpt the nervous system.

The properties of synaptic transmission were first elucidated at the
neuromuscular junction. More recent work has examined transmission at synapses
within the brain. Here we review the remarkable progress in understanding the
biophysical and molecular basis of the sequential steps in this process. These
steps include the elevation of Ca2+ in microdomains of the presynaptic terminal, 
the diffusion of transmitter through the fusion pore into the synaptic cleft and 
the activation of postsynaptic receptors. The results give insight into the
factors that control the precision of quantal transmission and provide a
framework for understanding synaptic plasticity.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits for
patients with otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective disorders.
This technique is not only clinically useful, but it can also provide new
insights into fundamental brain functions through direct manipulation of both
local and distributed brain networks in many different species. In particular,
DBS can be used in conjunction with non-invasive neuroimaging methods such as
magnetoencephalography to map the fundamental mechanisms of normal and abnormal
oscillatory synchronization that underlie human brain function. The precise
mechanisms of action for DBS remain uncertain, but here we give an up-to-date
overview of the principles of DBS, its neural mechanisms and its potential future
applications.

Music performance is both a natural human activity, present in all societies, and
one of the most complex and demanding cognitive challenges that the human mind
can undertake. Unlike most other sensory-motor activities, music performance
requires precise timing of several hierarchically organized actions, as well as
precise control over pitch interval production, implemented through diverse
effectors according to the instrument involved. We review the cognitive
neuroscience literature of both motor and auditory domains, highlighting the
value of studying interactions between these systems in a musical context, and
propose some ideas concerning the role of the premotor cortex in integration of
higher order features of music with appropriately timed and organized actions.

Unchecked aggression and violence exact a significant toll on human societies.
Aggression is an umbrella term for behaviours that are intended to inflict harm. 
These behaviours evolved as adaptations to deal with competition, but when
expressed out of context, they can have destructive consequences. Uncontrolled
aggression has several components, such as impaired recognition of social cues
and enhanced impulsivity. Molecular approaches to the study of aggression have
revealed biological signals that mediate the components of aggressive behaviour. 
These signals may provide targets for therapeutic intervention for individuals
with extreme aggressive outbursts. This Review summarizes the complex
interactions between genes, biological signals, neural circuits and the
environment that influence the development and expression of aggressive
behaviour.

No sensory stimulus is an island unto itself; rather, it can only properly be
interpreted in light of the stimuli that surround it in space and time. This can 
result in entertaining illusions and puzzling results in psychological and
neurophysiological experiments. We concentrate on perhaps the best studied test
case, namely orientation or tilt, which gives rise to the notorious tilt illusion
and the adaptation tilt after-effect. We review the empirical literature and
discuss the computational and statistical ideas that are battling to explain
these conundrums, and thereby gain favour as more general accounts of cortical
processing.

TRP channels in mechanosensation: direct or indirect activation?

Ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily are involved
in a wide variety of neural signalling processes, most prominently in sensory
receptor cells. They are essential for mechanosensation in systems ranging from
fruitfly hearing, to nematode touch, to mouse mechanical pain. However, it is
unclear in many instances whether a TRP channel directly transduces the
mechanical stimulus or is part of a downstream signalling pathway. Here, we
propose criteria for establishing direct mechanical activation of ion channels
and review these criteria in a number of mechanosensory systems in which TRP
channels are involved.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has in recent years been used
to explore therapeutic opportunities in a bewildering variety of conditions.
Although there is good evidence that this technique can modify cortical activity,
the rationale for its use in many of the conditions investigated so far is not
clear. Here we discuss the effects of rTMS in healthy subjects and how it has
been used in a number of neurological conditions. We argue that a better
understanding of both the effects of rTMS and the pathological processes
underlying the conditions for which it is used will reveal whether rTMS really
does offer therapeutic potential and, if so, for which conditions.

The primal role that the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has in the development of
Alzheimer's disease is now almost universally accepted. It is also well
recognized that Abeta exists in multiple assembly states, which have different
physiological or pathophysiological effects. Although the classical view is that 
Abeta is deposited extracellularly, emerging evidence from transgenic mice and
human patients indicates that this peptide can also accumulate intraneuronally,
which may contribute to disease progression.

It is now widely accepted that neurogenesis occurs in two regions of the adult
mammalian brain--the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. There is evidence for
adult neurogenesis in several additional areas, including the neocortex,
striatum, amygdala and substantia nigra, but this has been difficult to replicate
consistently other than in the damaged brain. The discrepancies may be due to
variations in the sensitivity of the methods used to detect new neurons.

biologists have been unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the
migration, proliferation and differentiation of the neural crest derivatives that

exciting recent advances, including novel transgenic and genetic tools, a
broadening range of model organisms, and the pursuit of ENS stem cells as a
therapeutic tool, that are bringing these fields closer together.

The action potential of the squid giant axon is formed by just two
voltage-dependent conductances in the cell membrane, yet mammalian central
neurons typically express more than a dozen different types of voltage-dependent 
ion channels. This rich repertoire of channels allows neurons to encode
information by generating action potentials with a wide range of shapes,
frequencies and patterns. Recent work offers an increasingly detailed
understanding of how the expression of particular channel types underlies the
remarkably diverse firing behaviour of various types of neurons.

The spatio-temporal timing of the last round of mitosis, followed by the
migration of neuroblasts to the cortical plate leads to the formation of the
six-layered cortex that is subdivided into functionally defined cortical areas.
Whereas many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms have been established in
rodents, there are a number of unique features that require further elucidation
in primates. Recent findings both in rodents and in primates indicate that
regulation of the cell cycle, specifically of the G1 phase has a crucial role in 
controlling area-specific rates of neuron production and the generation of
cytoarchitectonic maps.

In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the
mechanisms underlying the specification of projection neurons within the
mammalian neocortex. New experimental approaches have made it possible to
identify progenitors and study the lineage relationships of different neocortical
projection neurons. An expanding set of genes with layer and neuronal subtype
specificity have been identified within the neocortex, and their function during 
projection neuron development is starting to be elucidated. Here, we assess
recent data regarding the nature of neocortical progenitors, review the roles of 
individual genes in projection neuron specification and discuss the implications 
for progenitor plasticity.

The number and subunit composition of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
(NMDARs) are not static, but change in a cell- and synapse-specific manner during
development and in response to neuronal activity and sensory experience. Neuronal
activity drives not only NMDAR synaptic targeting and incorporation, but also
receptor retrieval, differential sorting into the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and
lateral diffusion between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. An emerging concept
is that activity-dependent, bidirectional regulation of NMDAR trafficking
provides a dynamic and potentially powerful mechanism for the regulation of
synaptic efficacy and remodelling, which, if dysregulated, can contribute to
neuropsychiatric disorders such as cocaine addiction, Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia.

Our ability to coordinate the use of our left and right eyes and to make use of
subtle differences between the images received by each eye allows us to perceive 
stereoscopic depth, which is important for the visual perception of
three-dimensional space. Binocular neurons in the visual cortex combine signals
from the left and right eyes. Probing the roles of binocular neurons in different
perceptual tasks has advanced our understanding of the stages within the visual
cortex that lead to binocular depth perception.

Adult CNS neurons are typically described as permanently postmitotic but there is
probably nothing permanent about the neuronal cell cycle arrest. Rather, it
appears that these highly differentiated cells must constantly keep their cell
cycle in check. Relaxation of this vigilance leads to the initiation of a cell
cycle and entrance into an altered and vulnerable state, often leading to death. 
There is evidence that neurons which are at risk of neurodegeneration are also at
risk of re-initiating a cell cycle process that involves the expression of cell
cycle proteins and DNA replication. Failure of cell cycle regulation might be a
root cause of several neurodegenerative disorders and a final common pathway for 
others.

Many neurological and most psychiatric disorders are not due to mutations in a
single gene; rather, they involve molecular disturbances entailing multiple genes
and signals that control their expression. Recent research has demonstrated that 
complex 'epigenetic' mechanisms, which regulate gene activity without altering
the DNA code, have long-lasting effects within mature neurons. This review
summarizes recent evidence for the existence of sustained epigenetic mechanisms
of gene regulation in neurons that have been implicated in the regulation of
complex behaviour, including abnormalities in several psychiatric disorders such 
as depression, drug addiction and schizophrenia.

A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits encode memory
and guide behaviour. Studying simple, genetically tractable organisms, such as
Drosophila melanogaster, can illuminate principles of neural circuit organization
and function. Early genetic dissection of D. melanogaster olfactory memory
focused on individual genes and molecules. These molecular tags subsequently
revealed key neural circuits for memory. Recent advances in genetic technology
have allowed us to manipulate and observe activity in these circuits, and even
individual neurons, in live animals. The studies have transformed D. melanogaster
from a useful organism for gene discovery to an ideal model to understand neural 
circuit function in memory.

The establishment of functional neural connections requires the growth of axons
to specific target areas and the formation of synapses with appropriate synaptic 
partners. Several molecules that regulate axon guidance and synapse formation
have been identified in the past decade, but it is unclear how a relatively
limited number of factors can specify a large number of connections. Recent
evidence indicates that transcription factors make a crucial contribution to the 
specification of connections in the nervous system by coordinating the response
of neurons to guidance molecules and neurotransmitters.

Despite decades of research, the functional neuroanatomy of speech processing has
been difficult to characterize. A major impediment to progress may have been the 
failure to consider task effects when mapping speech-related processing systems. 
We outline a dual-stream model of speech processing that remedies this situation.
In this model, a ventral stream processes speech signals for comprehension, and a
dorsal stream maps acoustic speech signals to frontal lobe articulatory networks.
The model assumes that the ventral stream is largely bilaterally
organized--although there are important computational differences between the
left- and right-hemisphere systems--and that the dorsal stream is strongly
left-hemisphere dominant.

Animals, in particular humans, frequently punish other individuals who behave
negatively or uncooperatively towards them. In animals, this usually serves to
protect the personal interests of the individual concerned, and its kin. However,
humans also punish altruistically, in which the act of punishing is personally
costly. The propensity to do so has been proposed to reflect the cultural
acquisition of norms of behaviour, which incorporates the desire to uphold equity
and fairness, and promotes cooperation. Here, we review the proximate
neurobiological basis of punishment, considering the motivational processes that 
underlie punishing actions.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), a failure to develop the large bundle of 
fibres that connect the cerebral hemispheres, occurs in 1:4000 individuals.
Genetics, animal models and detailed structural neuroimaging are now providing
insights into the developmental and molecular bases of AgCC. Studies using
neuropsychological, electroencephalogram and functional MRI approaches are
examining the resulting impairments in emotional and social functioning, and have
begun to explore the functional neuroanatomy underlying impaired higher-order
cognition. The study of AgCC could provide insight into the integrated cerebral
functioning of healthy brains, and may offer a model for understanding certain
psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia and autism.

Some fundamental principles of colour vision, deduced from perceptual studies,
have been understood for a long time. Physiological studies have confirmed the
existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons
that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to
unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of
different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour
vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be
random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms;
and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a
higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a
simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have
made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.

Two-pore-domain K(+) (K(2P)) channel subunits are made up of four transmembrane
segments and two pore-forming domains that are arranged in tandem and function as
either homo- or heterodimeric channels. This structural motif is associated with 
unusual gating properties, including background channel activity and sensitivity 
to membrane stretch. Moreover, K(2P) channels are modulated by a variety of
cellular lipids and pharmacological agents, including polyunsaturated fatty acids
and volatile general anaesthetics. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that 
TREK1, the most thoroughly studied K(2P) channel, has a key role in the cellular 
mechanisms of neuroprotection, anaesthesia, pain and depression.

Memory reconsolidation has been argued to be a distinct process that serves to
maintain, strengthen or modify memories. Specifically, the retrieval of a
previously consolidated memory has been hypothesized to induce an additional
activity-dependent labile period during which the memory can be modified.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of reconsolidation could provide crucial
insights into the dynamic aspects of normal mnemonic function and psychiatric
disorders that are characterized by exceptionally strong and salient emotional
memories.

Damage to nerve fibre pathways results in a devastating loss of function, due to 
the disconnection of nerve fibres from their targets. However, some recovery does
occur and this has been correlated with the formation of new (albeit abnormal)
connections. The view that an untapped growth potential resides in the adult CNS 
has led to various attempts to stimulate the repair of disconnectional injuries. 
A key factor in the failure of axonal regeneration in the CNS after injury is the
loss of the aligned glial pathways that nerve fibres require for their
elongation. Transplantation of cultured adult olfactory ensheathing cells into
lesions is being investigated as a procedure to re-establish glial pathways
permissive for the regeneration of severed axons.

Neuropoietic cytokines are well known for their role in the control of neuronal, 
glial and immune responses to injury or disease. Since this discovery, it has
emerged that several of these proteins are also involved in nervous system
development, in particular in the regulation of neurogenesis and stem cell fate. 
Recent data indicate that these proteins have yet more functions, as key
modulators of synaptic plasticity and of various behaviours. In addition,
neuropoietic cytokines might be a factor in the aetiology of psychiatric
disorders.

After they are born and differentiate, neurons break their previous symmetry,
dramatically change their shape, and establish two structurally and functionally 
distinct compartments - axons and dendrites - within one cell. How do neurons
develop their morphologically and molecularly distinct compartments? Recent
studies have implicated several signalling pathways evoked by extracellular
signals as having essential roles in a number of aspects of neuronal
polarization.

In neurons, intracellular calcium signals have crucial roles in activating
neurotransmitter release and in triggering alterations in neuronal function.
Calmodulin has been widely studied as a Ca(2+) sensor that has several defined
roles in neuronal Ca(2+) signalling, but members of the neuronal calcium sensor
protein family have also begun to emerge as key components in a number of
regulatory pathways and have increased the diversity of neuronal Ca(2+)
signalling pathways. The differing properties of these proteins allow them to
have discrete, non-redundant functions.

Many cell adhesion molecules are localized at synaptic sites in neuronal axons
and dendrites. These molecules bridge pre- and postsynaptic specializations but
do far more than simply provide a mechanical link between cells. In this review, 
we will discuss the roles these proteins have during development and at mature
synapses. Synaptic adhesion proteins participate in the formation, maturation,
function and plasticity of synaptic connections. Together with conventional
synaptic transmission mechanisms, these molecules are an important element in the
trans-cellular communication mediated by synapses.

The increasing age of the population around the world has meant that greater
attention is being paid to disorders that mainly affect older people. In
particular, work is focusing on ways to preserve the healthy brain and prevent
dementia. Preventive studies are complex and must take into account not only
simple approaches such as those used in risk and outcome studies, but also stage 
of life, survival and mortality, and population context before their effect can
be assessed. This paper presents questions and areas which must be explored if
the potential for prevention of dementia during brain ageing is to be properly
understood.

Sleep and wakefulness are regulated to occur at appropriate times that are in
accordance with our internal and external environments. Avoiding danger and
finding food, which are life-essential activities that are regulated by emotion, 
reward and energy balance, require vigilance and therefore, by definition,
wakefulness. The orexin (hypocretin) system regulates sleep and wakefulness
through interactions with systems that regulate emotion, reward and energy
homeostasis.

Discoveries in the field of neuroscience are a natural source of discourse among 
scientists and have long been disseminated to the public. Historically, as news
of findings has travelled between communities, it has elicited both expected and 
unusual reactions. What scientific landmarks promote discourse within the
professional community? Do the same findings achieve a place in the public eye?
How does the media choose what is newsworthy, and why does the public react the
way it does? Drawing on examples of past challenges at the crossroads of
neuroscience and society and on a case study of trends in one neurogenetic
disease, autism, we explore the dialectical forces interacting in scientific and 
public discourse.

During the development of the nervous system, many different types of neuron are 
produced. As well as forming the correct type of neuron, each must also establish
precise connections. Recent findings show that, because of shared gene
programmes, neuronal identity is intimately linked to and coordinated with axonal
behaviour. Peripheral sensory neurons provide an excellent system in which to
study these interactions. This review examines how neuronal diversity is created 
in the PNS and describes proteins that help to direct the diversity of neuronal
subtypes, cell survival, axonal growth and the establishment of central patterns 
of modality-specific connections.

Activity-dependent changes in the strength of excitatory synapses are a cellular 
mechanism for the plasticity of neuronal networks that is widely recognized to
underlie cognitive functions such as learning and memory. AMPA
(alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-type glutamate
receptors (AMPARs) are the main transducers of rapid excitatory transmission in
the mammalian CNS, and recent discoveries indicate that the mechanisms which
regulate AMPARs are more complex than previously thought. This review focuses on 
recent evidence that alterations to AMPAR functional properties are coupled to
their trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics and local protein synthesis. These
relationships offer new insights into the regulation of AMPARs and synaptic
strength by cellular signalling.

The mitotic spindle is the cellular scaffold that facilitates proper segregation 
of genetic material during cell division. Far from being static, the spindle is a
dynamically regulated tool that can alter its size, shape and position during
mitosis. Work in both insect and vertebrate systems has shown that regulation of 
this structure involves an array of highly conserved proteins. Moreover, it is
now clear that tight regulation of the spindle during the process of neurogenesis
is paramount to proper cell division and generation of the nervous system as a
whole.

Lipid rafts are specialized structures on the plasma membrane that have an
altered lipid composition as well as links to the cytoskeleton. It has been
proposed that these structures are membrane domains in which neurotransmitter
signalling might occur through a clustering of receptors and components of
receptor-activated signalling cascades. The localization of these proteins in
lipid rafts, which is affected by the cytoskeleton, also influences the potency
and efficacy of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The effect of lipid 
rafts on neurotransmitter signalling has also been implicated in neurological and
psychiatric diseases.

Mounting evidence indicates that microglial activation contributes to neuronal
damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies show that in response to
certain environmental toxins and endogenous proteins, microglia can enter an
overactivated state and release reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause
neurotoxicity. Pattern recognition receptors expressed on the microglial surface 
seem to be one of the primary, common pathways by which diverse toxin signals are
transduced into ROS production. Overactivated microglia can be detected using
imaging techniques and therefore this knowledge offers an opportunity not only
for early diagnosis but, importantly, for the development of targeted
anti-inflammatory therapies that might slow or halt the progression of
neurodegenerative disease.

Gamma frequency oscillations are thought to provide a temporal structure for
information processing in the brain. They contribute to cognitive functions, such
as memory formation and sensory processing, and are disturbed in some psychiatric
disorders. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing, soma-inhibiting interneurons
have a key role in the generation of these oscillations. Experimental analysis in
the hippocampus and the neocortex reveals that synapses among these interneurons 
are highly specialized. Computational analysis further suggests that synaptic
specialization turns interneuron networks into robust gamma frequency
oscillators.

Approximately 40 million people worldwide are infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite HIV's known propensity to infect the CNS
and cause neurological disease, HIV neurocognitive disorders remain
under-recognized. Although combination antiretroviral therapy has improved the
health of millions of those living with HIV, the penetration into the CNS of many
such therapies is limited, and patients' quality of life continues to be
diminished by milder, residual neurocognitive impairment. Synaptodendritic
neuronal injury is emerging as an important mediator of such deficits in HIV. By 
carefully selecting specific antiretrovirals and supplementing them with
neuroprotective agents, physicians might be able to facilitate innate CNS repair,
promoting enhanced synaptodendritic plasticity, neural function and clinical
neurological status.

Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral mesodiencephalon are essential for
the control of voluntary movement and the regulation of emotion, and are severely
affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recent
advances in molecular biology and mouse genetics have helped to unravel the
mechanisms involved in the development of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA)
neurons, including their specification, migration and differentiation, as well as
the processes that govern axonal pathfinding and their specific patterns of
connectivity and maintenance. Here, we follow the developmental path of these
neurons with the goal of generating a molecular code that could be exploited in
cell-replacement strategies to treat diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Neural development and the organization of complex neuronal circuits involve a
number of processes that require cell-cell interaction. During these processes,
axons choose specific partners for synapse formation and dendrites elaborate
arborizations by interacting with other dendrites. The cadherin superfamily is a 
group of cell surface receptors that is comprised of more than 100 members. The
molecular structures and diversity within this family suggest that these
molecules regulate the contacts or signalling between neurons in a variety of
ways. In this review I discuss the roles of three subfamilies - classic
cadherins, Flamingo/CELSRs and protocadherins - in the regulation of neuronal
recognition and connectivity.

An influential concept in contemporary computational neuroscience is the reward
prediction error hypothesis of phasic dopaminergic function. It maintains that
midbrain dopaminergic neurons signal the occurrence of unpredicted reward, which 
is used in appetitive learning to reinforce existing actions that most often lead
to reward. However, the availability of limited afferent sensory processing and
the precise timing of dopaminergic signals suggest that they might instead have a
central role in identifying which aspects of context and behavioural output are
crucial in causing unpredicted events.

Atlases of the human brain have an important impact on neuroscience. The
emergence of ever more sophisticated imaging techniques, brain mapping methods
and analytical strategies has the potential to revolutionize the concept of the
brain atlas. Atlases can now combine data describing multiple aspects of brain
structure or function at different scales from different subjects, yielding a
truly integrative and comprehensive description of this organ. These integrative 
approaches have provided significant impetus for the human brain mapping
initiatives, and have important applications in health and disease.

The discovery of premotor and parietal cells known as mirror neurons in the
macaque brain that fire not only when the animal is in action, but also when it
observes others carrying out the same actions provides a plausible
neurophysiological mechanism for a variety of important social behaviours, from
imitation to empathy. Recent data also show that dysfunction of the mirror neuron
system in humans might be a core deficit in autism, a socially isolating
condition. Here, we review the neurophysiology of the mirror neuron system and
its role in social cognition and discuss the clinical implications of mirror
neuron dysfunction.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in
young adults. Recent studies have implicated specific sodium channel isoforms as 
having an important role in several aspects of the pathophysiology of MS,
including the restoration of impulse conduction after demyelination, axonal
degeneration and the mistuning of Purkinje neurons that leads to cerebellar
dysfunction. By manipulating the activity of these channels or their expression, 
it might be possible to develop new therapeutic approaches that will prevent or
limit disability in MS.

High-conductance, 'big' potassium (BK) channels encoded by the Slo gene family
are among the largest and most complex of the extended family of potassium
channels. The family of SLO channels apparently evolved from voltage-dependent
potassium channels, but acquired a large conserved carboxyl extension, which
allows channel gating to be altered in response to the direct sensing of several 
different intracellular ions, and by other second-messenger systems, such as
those activated following neurotransmitter binding to G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). This versatility has been exploited to serve many cellular roles, both
within and outside the nervous system.

A class of small, non-coding transcripts called microRNAs (miRNAs) that provide a
crucial and pervasive layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation has recently 
emerged and become the focus of intense research. miRNAs are abundant in the
nervous system, where they have key roles in development and are likely to be
important mediators of plasticity. A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis
is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons.
Although there are nearly 500 known human miRNA sequences, each of only
approximately 21 nucleotides, which bind to multiple mRNA targets, the accurate
prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp. Nevertheless, the
identification of such targets promises to provide new insights into many facets 
of neuronal function.

Whenever food is placed in the mouth, taste receptors are stimulated.
Simultaneously, different types of sensory fibre that monitor several food
attributes such as texture, temperature and odour are activated. Here, we
evaluate taste and oral somatosensory peripheral transduction mechanisms as well 
as the multi-sensory integrative functions of the central pathways that support
the complex sensations that we usually associate with gustation. On the basis of 
recent experimental data, we argue that these brain circuits make use of
distributed ensemble codes that represent the sensory and post-ingestive
properties of tastants.

Phantom pain refers to pain in a body part that has been amputated or
deafferented. It has often been viewed as a type of mental disorder or has been
assumed to stem from pathological alterations in the region of the amputation
stump. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated that phantom pain might be a 
phenomenon of the CNS that is related to plastic changes at several levels of the
neuraxis and especially the cortex. Here, we discuss the evidence for putative
pathophysiological mechanisms with an emphasis on central, and in particular
cortical, changes. We cite both animal and human studies and derive suggestions
for innovative interventions aimed at alleviating phantom pain.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a cholesterol transport protein and an
isoform-specific major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. The
lipoprotein receptors that bind APOE have recently been recognized as pivotal
components of the neuronal signalling machinery. The interaction between APOE
receptors and one of their ligands, reelin, allows them to function directly as
signal transduction receptors at the plasma membrane to control not only neuronal
positioning during brain development, but also synaptic plasticity in the adult
brain. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms through which APOE, cholesterol, 
reelin and APOE receptors control synaptic functions that are essential for
cognition, learning, memory, behaviour and neuronal survival.

The sensory epithelia of the inner ear contain mechanosensory hair cells and
non-sensory supporting cells. Both classes of cell are heterogeneous, with
phenotypes varying both between and within epithelia. The specification of
individual cells as distinct types of hair cell or supporting cell is regulated
through intra- and extracellular signalling pathways that have been poorly
understood. However, new methodologies have resulted in significant steps forward
in our understanding of the molecular pathways that direct cells towards these
cell fates.

The dramatic evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex of Homo sapiens
underlies our unique higher cortical functions, and therefore bears on the
ultimate issue of what makes us human. Recent insights into developmental events 
during early proliferative stages of cortical development indicate how neural
stem and progenitor cells might interact to produce cortical expansion during
development, and could shed light on evolutionary changes in cortical structure.

The central retina mediates high acuity vision, and its progressive dysfunction
due to macular degeneration is the leading cause of visual disability among
adults in industrialized societies. Here, we summarize recent progress in
understanding the pathophysiology of macular degeneration and the implications of
this new knowledge for treatment and prevention. The past decade has witnessed
remarkable advances in this field, including the development of new, non-invasive
retinal imaging technologies, the development of animal models for macular
disease, and the isolation of many of the genes responsible for both early- and
late-onset macular diseases. These advances have set the stage for the
development of effective mechanism-based therapies.

Genes are major contributors to many psychiatric diseases, but their mechanisms
of action have long seemed elusive. The intermediate phenotype concept represents
a strategy for characterizing the neural systems affected by risk gene variants
to elucidate quantitative, mechanistic aspects of brain function implicated in
psychiatric disease. Using imaging genetics as an example, we illustrate recent
advances, challenges and implications of linking genes to structural and
functional variation in brain systems related to cognition and emotion.

Cancer pain significantly affects the diagnosis, quality of life and survival of

the mechanisms by which anti-neoplastic agents induce peripheral neuropathy.
Developing a mechanism-based understanding and mechanism-based therapies to treat
cancer-associated pain and sensory neuropathy, and incorporating these into
mainstream cancer research and therapy, will be crucial to improving the quality 
of life and survival of patients with cancer.

During the past 5 years, gene expression studies in cell culture, animal models
and in the brains of patients have shown that the perturbation of transcription
frequently results in neuronal dysfunction in polyglutamine repeat diseases such 
as Huntington's disease. Histone deacetylases act as repressors of transcription 
through interactions with co-repressor complexes, which leads to chromatin
remodelling. Aberrant interactions between polyglutamine proteins and regulators 
of transcription could be one mechanism by which transcriptional dysregulation
occurs. Here, we discuss the potential therapeutic pathways through which histone
deacetylase inhibitors might act to correct the aberrant transcription observed
in Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine repeat diseases.

Sonic hedgehog has received an enormous amount of attention since its role as a
morphogen that directs ventral patterning in the spinal cord was discovered a
decade ago. Since that time, a bewildering array of information has been
generated concerning both the components of the hedgehog signalling pathway and
the remarkable number of contexts in which it functions. Nowhere is this more
evident than in the nervous system, where hedgehog signalling has been implicated
in events as disparate as axonal guidance and stem cell maintenance. Here we
review our present knowledge of the hedgehog signalling pathway and speculate
about areas in which further insights into this versatile pathway might be
forthcoming.

Various studies, mostly in the past 5 years, have demonstrated that, in addition 
to their well-described function in regulating electrical excitability,
voltage-dependent ion channels participate in intracellular signalling pathways. 
Channels can directly activate enzymes linked to cellular signalling pathways,
serve as cell adhesion molecules or components of the cytoskeleton, and their
activity can alter the expression of specific genes. Here, I review these
findings and discuss the extent to which the molecular mechanisms of such
signalling are understood.

Functional MRI (fMRI) has had a major impact in cognitive neuroscience. fMRI now 
has a small but growing role in clinical neuroimaging, with initial applications 
to neurosurgical planning. Current clinical research has emphasized novel
concepts for clinicians, such as the role of plasticity in recovery and the
maintenance of brain functions in a broad range of diseases. There is a wider
potential for clinical fMRI in applications ranging from presymptomatic
diagnosis, through drug development and individualization of therapies, to
understanding functional brain disorders. Realization of this potential will
require changes in the way clinical neuroimaging services are planned and
delivered.

Neural tube closure takes place during early embryogenesis and requires
interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Failure of neural tube
closure is a common congenital malformation that results in morbidity and
mortality. A major clinical achievement has been the use of periconceptional
folic acid supplements, which prevents approximately 50-75% of cases of neural
tube defects. However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of folic
acid is far from clear. Biochemical, genetic and epidemiological observations
have led to the development of the methylation hypothesis, which suggests that
folic acid prevents neural tube defects by stimulating cellular methylation
reactions. Exploring the methylation hypothesis could direct us towards
additional strategies to prevent neural tube defects.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic disorder caused by motor
neuron degeneration. Mutations in more than 50 human genes cause diverse types of
motor neuron pathology. Moreover, defects in five Mendelian genes lead to motor
neuron disease, with two mutations reproducing the ALS phenotype. Analyses of
these genetic effects have generated new insights into the diverse molecular
pathways involved in ALS pathogenesis. Here, we present an overview of the
mechanisms for motor neuron death and of the role of non-neuronal cells in ALS.

Behavioural, cellular and molecular studies have revealed significant effects of

into mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity, including adult neurogenesis 
and synaptic plasticity. The demonstration that the onset and progression of
Huntington's disease in transgenic mice is delayed by environmental enrichment
has emphasized the importance of understanding both genetic and environmental
factors in nervous system disorders, including those with Mendelian inheritance
patterns. A range of rodent models of other brain disorders, including
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, fragile X and Down syndrome, as well
as various forms of brain injury, have now been compared under enriched and
standard housing conditions. Here, we review these findings on the environmental 
modulators of pathogenesis and gene-environment interactions in CNS disorders,
and discuss their therapeutic implications.

GABA-containing interneurons are crucial to both the development and function of

conserved set of characteristics, interneurons include multiple phenotypes that
vary on morphological, physiological and neurochemical axes. This diversity, and 
the relatively late, context-dependent maturation of defining features, has
challenged efforts to uncover the transcriptional control of cortical interneuron
development. Here, we discuss recent data that are beginning to illuminate the
origins and specification of distinct subgroups of cortical interneurons.

The hippocampal formation can encode relative spatial location, without reference
to external cues, by the integration of linear and angular self-motion (path
integration). Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical
discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some
of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic 
matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple,
symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases
systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC,
apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed
signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from
so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic
spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.

In the human brain, distinct functions tend to be localized in the left or right 
hemispheres, with language ability usually localized predominantly in the left
and spatial recognition in the right. Furthermore, humans are perhaps the only
mammals who have preferential handedness, with more than 90% of the population
more skillful at using the right hand, which is controlled by the left
hemisphere. How is a distinct function consistently localized in one side of the 
human brain? Because of the convergence of molecular and neurological analysis,
we are beginning to consider the puzzle of brain asymmetry and handedness at a
molecular level.

perhaps, the mechanisms that underlie recovery have rarely been definitively
established. Here, we critically evaluate the evidence that regeneration of
damaged pathways or compensatory collateral sprouting can promote recovery. We
also discuss several more speculative mechanisms that might putatively explain or
confound some of the reported outcomes of experimental interventions.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to paraplegia or quadriplegia. Although there
are no fully restorative treatments for SCI, various rehabilitative, cellular and
molecular therapies have been tested in animal models. Many of these have
reached, or are approaching, clinical trials. Here, we review these potential
therapies, with an emphasis on the need for reproducible evidence of safety and
efficacy. Individual therapies are unlikely to provide a panacea. Rather, we
predict that combinations of strategies will lead to improvements in outcome
after SCI. Basic scientific research should provide a rational basis for
tailoring specific combinations of clinical therapies to different types of SCI.

Glial inhibition of CNS axon regeneration.

Yiu G(1), He Z.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Neuroscience, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115,
USA.

Damage to the adult CNS often leads to persistent deficits due to the inability
of mature axons to regenerate after injury. Mounting evidence suggests that the
glial environment of the adult CNS, which includes inhibitory molecules in CNS
myelin as well as proteoglycans associated with astroglial scarring, might
present a major hurdle for successful axon regeneration. Here, we evaluate the
molecular basis of these inhibitory influences and their contributions to the
limitation of long-distance axon repair and other types of structural plasticity.
Greater insight into glial inhibition is crucial for developing therapies to
promote functional recovery after neural injury.

Can regenerating axons recapitulate developmental guidance during recovery from
spinal cord injury?

Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.

The precise wiring of the adult mammalian CNS originates during a period of
stunning growth, guidance and plasticity that occurs during and shortly after
development. When injured in adults, this intricate system fails to regenerate.
Even when the obstacles to regeneration are cleared, growing adult CNS fibres
usually remain misdirected and fail to reform functional connections. Here, we
attempt to fill an important niche related to the topics of nervous system
development and regeneration. We specifically contrast the difficulties faced by 
growing fibres within the adult context to the precise circuit-forming
capabilities of developing fibres. In addition to focusing on methods to
stimulate growth in the adult, we also expand on approaches to recapitulate
development itself.

Gene-environment interaction research in psychiatry is new, and is a natural ally
of neuroscience. Mental disorders have known environmental causes, but there is
heterogeneity in the response to each causal factor, which gene-environment
findings attribute to genetic differences at the DNA sequence level. Such
findings come from epidemiology, an ideal branch of science for showing that a
gene-environment interactions exist in nature and affect a significant fraction
of disease cases. The complementary discipline of epidemiology, experimental
neuroscience, fuels gene-environment hypotheses and investigates underlying
neural mechanisms. This article discusses opportunities and challenges in the
collaboration between psychiatry, epidemiology and neuroscience in studying
gene-environment interactions.

Long-term memory and its putative synaptic correlates the late phases of both
long-term potentiation and long-term depression require enhanced protein
synthesis. On the basis of recent data on translation-dependent synaptic
plasticity and on the supralinear effect of activation of nearby synapses on
action potential generation, we propose a model for the formation of long-term
memory engrams at the single neuron level. In this model, which we call clustered
plasticity, local translational enhancement, along with synaptic tagging and
capture, facilitates the formation of long-term memory engrams through
bidirectional synaptic weight changes among synapses within a dendritic branch.

Neurons in most animals live a very long time relative to the half-lives of all
of the proteins that govern excitability and synaptic transmission. Consequently,
homeostatic mechanisms are necessary to ensure stable neuronal and network
function over an animal's lifetime. To understand how these homeostatic
mechanisms might function, it is crucial to understand how tightly regulated
synaptic and intrinsic properties must be for adequate network performance, and
the extent to which compensatory mechanisms allow for multiple solutions to the
production of similar behaviour. Here, we use examples from theoretical and
experimental studies of invertebrates and vertebrates to explore several issues
relevant to understanding the precision of tuning of synaptic and intrinsic
currents for the operation of functional neuronal circuits.

The distribution and targeting of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels.

Lai HC(1), Jan LY.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Basic Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.

Voltage-gated ion channels have to be at the right place in the right number to
endow individual neurons with their specific character. Their biophysical
properties together with their spatial distribution define the signalling
characteristics of a neuron. Improper channel localization could cause
communication defects in a neuronal network. This review covers recent studies of
mechanisms for targeting voltage-gated ion channels to axons and dendrites,
including trafficking, retention and endocytosis pathways for the preferential
localization of particular ion channels. We also discuss how the spatial
localization of these channels might contribute to the electrical excitability of
neurons, and consider the need for future work in this emerging field.

The neurobiology of itch, which is formally known as pruritus, and its
interaction with pain have been illustrated by the complexity of specific
mediators, itch-related neuronal pathways and the central processing of itch.
Scratch-induced pain can abolish itch, and analgesic opioids can generate itch,
which indicates an antagonistic interaction. However, recent data suggest that
there is a broad overlap between pain- and itch-related peripheral mediators
and/or receptors, and there are astonishingly similar mechanisms of neuronal
sensitization in the PNS and the CNS. The antagonistic interaction between pain
and itch is already exploited in pruritus therapy, and current research
concentrates on the identification of common targets for future analgesic and
antipruritic therapy.

Recent advances in human neuroimaging have shown that it is possible to
accurately decode a person's conscious experience based only on non-invasive
measurements of their brain activity. Such 'brain reading' has mostly been
studied in the domain of visual perception, where it helps reveal the way in
which individual experiences are encoded in the human brain. The same approach
can also be extended to other types of mental state, such as covert attitudes and
lie detection. Such applications raise important ethical issues concerning the
privacy of personal thought.

Evidence has been accumulating that the primate cerebellum contributes not only
to motor control, but also to higher 'cognitive' function. However, there is no
consensus about how the cerebellum processes such information. The answer to this
puzzle can be found in the nature of cerebellar connections to areas of the
cerebral cortex (particularly the prefrontal cortex) and in the uniformity of its
intrinsic cellular organization, which implies uniformity in information
processing regardless of the area of origin in the cerebral cortex. With this in 
mind, the relatively well-developed models of how the cerebellum processes
information from the motor cortex might be extended to explain how it could also 
process information from the prefrontal cortex.

Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs are often used to treat psychiatric symptoms
frequently seen in dementia, but their use is controversial. We present a new
meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of
psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, and discuss the more limited
evidence for their potential benefits in other dementias. We recommend that these
treatments be limited to the short-term treatment of psychiatric symptoms
associated with serious distress or risk.

Intuitively, decisions should always improve with more time for the accumulation 
of evidence, yet psychophysical data show a limit of 200-300 ms for many
perceptual tasks. Here, we consider mechanisms that favour such rapid information
processing in vision and olfaction. We suggest that the brain limits some types
of perceptual processing to short, discrete chunks (for example, eye fixations
and sniffs) in order to facilitate the construction of global sensory images.

Many organisms, especially humans, are characterized by their capacity for
intentional, goal-directed actions. However, similar behaviours often proceed
automatically, as habitual responses to antecedent stimuli. How are goal-directed
actions transformed into habitual responses? Recent work combining modern
behavioural assays and neurobiological analysis of the basal ganglia has begun to
yield insights into the neural basis of habit formation.

In vivo microscopy is an exciting tool for neurological research because it can
reveal how single cells respond to damage of the nervous system. This helps us to
understand how diseases unfold and how therapies work. Here, we review the
optical imaging techniques used to visualize the different parts of the nervous
system, and how they have provided fresh insights into the aetiology and
therapeutics of neurological diseases. We focus our discussion on five areas of
neuropathology (trauma, degeneration, ischaemia, inflammation and seizures) in
which in vivo microscopy has had the greatest impact. We discuss the challenging 
issues in the field, and argue that the convergence of new optical and
non-optical methods will be necessary to overcome these challenges.

Adaptation is one of physiology's fundamental tenets, operating not only at the
level of species, as Darwin proposed, but also at the level of tissues, cells,
molecules and, perhaps, genes. During recent years, stroke neurobiologists have
advanced a considerable body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that, with
experimental coaxing, the mammalian brain can adapt to injurious insults such as 
cerebral ischaemia to promote cell survival in the face of subsequent injury.
Establishing this protective phenotype in response to stress depends on a
coordinated response at the genomic, molecular, cellular and tissue levels. Here,
I summarize our current understanding of how 'preconditioning' stimuli trigger a 
cerebroprotective state known as cerebral 'ischaemic tolerance'.

Activity-dependent release of ATP from synapses, axons and glia activates
purinergic membrane receptors that modulate intracellular calcium and cyclic AMP.
This enables glia to detect neural activity and communicate among other glial
cells by releasing ATP through membrane channels and vesicles. Through purinergic
signalling, impulse activity regulates glial proliferation, motility, survival,
differentiation and myelination, and facilitates interactions between neurons,
and vascular and immune system cells. Interactions among purinergic, growth
factor and cytokine signalling regulate synaptic strength, development and
responses to injury. We review the involvement of ATP and adenosine receptors in 
neuron-glia signalling, including the release and hydrolysis of ATP, how the
receptors signal, the pharmacological tools used to study them, and their
functional significance.

A rapidly burgeoning literature documents copious sex influences on brain
anatomy, chemistry and function. This article highlights some of the more
intriguing recent discoveries and their implications. Consideration of the
effects of sex can help to explain seemingly contradictory findings. Research
into sex influences is mandatory to fully understand a host of brain disorders
with sex differences in their incidence and/or nature. The striking quantity and 
diversity of sex-related influences on brain function indicate that the still
widespread assumption that sex influences are negligible cannot be justified, and
probably retards progress in our field.

Recent evidence shows that transplantation of neural stem/precursor cells may
protect the central nervous system from inflammatory damage through a 'bystander'
mechanism that is alternative to cell replacement. This novel mechanism, which
might improve the success of transplantation procedures, is exerted by
undifferentiated neural stem cells, the functional characteristics of which are
regulated by important stem cell regulators released by CNS-resident and
blood-borne inflammatory cells. Here, we discuss this alternative bystander
mechanism in the context of the atypical ectopic perivascular niche. We propose
that it is the most challenging example of reciprocal therapeutic crosstalk
between the inflamed CNS and systemically transplanted neural stem cells.

Neural mechanisms in Williams syndrome: a unique window to genetic influences on

Williams syndrome, a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of about 28
genes on chromosome 7q11.23, has long intrigued neuroscientists with its unique
combination of striking behavioural abnormalities, such as hypersociability, and 
characteristic neurocognitive profile. Williams syndrome, therefore, raises
fundamental questions about the neural mechanisms of social behaviour, the
modularity of mind and brain development, and provides a privileged setting to
understand genetic influences on complex brain functions in a 'bottom-up' way. We
review recent advances in uncovering the functional and structural neural
substrates of Williams syndrome that provide an emerging understanding of how
these are related to dissociable genetic contributions characterized both in
special participant populations and animal models.

Attention is a central theme in cognitive science - it exemplifies the links
between the brain and behaviour, and binds psychology to the techniques of
neuroscience. A visionary model suggested by Michael Posner described attention
as a set of independent control networks. This challenged the previously held
view of attention as a uniform concept. The idea that disparate attentional
networks correlate with discrete neural circuitry and can be influenced by focal 
brain injuries, mental state and specific drugs has since been supported by
converging data from several modern methodologies. Given the recent explosion in 
empirical data, attentional typologies provide powerful conceptual tools with
which to contextualize and integrate these findings.

How the brain encodes information in population activity, and how it combines and
manipulates that activity as it carries out computations, are questions that lie 
at the heart of systems neuroscience. During the past decade, with the advent of 
multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have
begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal
variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing.
This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although
the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can 
be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal
noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding 
in general.

The process through which young male songbirds learn the characteristics of the
songs of an adult male of their own species has strong similarities with speech
acquisition in human infants. Both involve two phases: a period of auditory
memorization followed by a period during which the individual develops its own
vocalizations. The avian 'song system', a network of brain nuclei, is the
probable neural substrate for the second phase of sensorimotor learning. By
contrast, the neural representation of song memory acquired in the first phase is
localized outside the song system, in different regions of the avian equivalent
of the human auditory association cortex.

Hypertension - the chronic elevation of blood pressure - is a major human health 
problem. In most cases, the root cause of the disease remains unknown, but there 
is mounting evidence that many forms of hypertension are initiated and maintained
by an elevated sympathetic tone. This review examines how the sympathetic tone to
cardiovascular organs is generated, and discusses how elevated sympathetic tone
can contribute to hypertension.

Cognitive neuroscience is making rapid strides in areas highly relevant to
education. However, there is a gulf between current science and direct classroom 
applications. Most scientists would argue that filling the gulf is premature.
Nevertheless, at present, teachers are at the receiving end of numerous
'brain-based learning' packages. Some of these contain alarming amounts of
misinformation, yet such packages are being used in many schools. What, if
anything, can neuroscientists do to help good neuroscience into education?

we argue that the tremendous research potential of existing (and largely unused) 
digital reconstructions should diffuse any reticence to sharing this type of

Neuroscience is increasingly identifying associations between biology and
violence that appear to offer courts evidence relevant to criminal
responsibility. In addition, in a policy era of 'zero tolerance of risk',
evidence of biological abnormality in some of those who are violent, or
biological markers of violence, may be seized on as a possible basis for
preventive detention in the interest of public safety. However, there is a
mismatch between questions that the courts and society wish answered and those
that neuroscience is capable of answering. This poses a risk to the proper
exercise of justice and to civil liberties.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were among the first antidepressants to be
discovered and have long been used as such. It now seems that many of these
agents might have therapeutic value in several common neurodegenerative
conditions, independently of their inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity.
However, many claims and some counter-claims have been made about the
physiological importance of these enzymes and the potential of their inhibitors. 
We evaluate these arguments in the light of what we know, and still have to
learn, of the structure, function and genetics of the monoamine oxidases and the 
disparate actions of their inhibitors.

Everyone ages, but only some will develop a neurodegenerative disorder in the
process. Disease might occur when cells fail to respond adaptively to age-related
increases in oxidative, metabolic and ionic stress, thereby resulting in the
accumulation of damaged proteins, DNA and membranes. Determinants of neuronal
vulnerability might include cell size and location, metabolism of
disease-specific proteins and a repertoire of signal transduction pathways and
stress resistance mechanisms. Emerging evidence on protein interaction networks
that monitor and respond to the normal ageing process suggests that successful
neural ageing is possible for most people, but also cautions that cures for
neurodegenerative disorders are unlikely in the near future.

Social interaction is a cornerstone of human life, yet the neural mechanisms
underlying social cognition are poorly understood. Recently, research that
integrates approaches from neuroscience and social psychology has begun to shed
light on these processes, and converging evidence from neuroimaging studies
suggests a unique role for the medial frontal cortex. We review the emerging
literature that relates social cognition to the medial frontal cortex and, on the
basis of anatomical and functional characteristics of this brain region, propose 
a theoretical model of medial frontal cortical function relevant to different
aspects of social cognitive processing.

Lamination of neurons and fibre projections is a fundamental organizational
principle of the mammalian cerebral cortex. A laminated organization is likely to
be essential for cortical function, as studies in mutant mice have revealed
causal relationships between lamination defects and functional deficits.
Unveiling the determinants of the laminated cortical architecture will contribute
to our understanding of how cortical functions have evolved in phylogenetic and
ontogenetic development. Recently, the hippocampus, with its clearly segregated
cell and fibre layers, has become a major subject of studies on cortical
lamination.

People's faces show fear in many different circumstances. However, when people
are terrified, as well as showing emotion, they run for cover. When we see a
bodily expression of emotion, we immediately know what specific action is
associated with a particular emotion, leaving little need for interpretation of
the signal, as is the case for facial expressions. Research on emotional body
language is rapidly emerging as a new field in cognitive and affective
neuroscience. This article reviews how whole-body signals are automatically
perceived and understood, and their role in emotional communication and
decision-making.

Recent experiments in vivo and in vitro have advanced our understanding of the
sites and mechanisms involved in mammalian respiratory rhythm generation. Here we
evaluate and interpret the new evidence for two separate brainstem respiratory
oscillators and for the essential role of emergent network properties in rhythm
generation. Lesion studies suggest that respiratory cell death might explain
morbidity and mortality associated with neurodegenerative disorders and ageing.

Filling-in is a perceptual phenomenon in which a visual attribute such as colour,
brightness, texture or motion is perceived in a region of the visual field even
though such an attribute exists only in the surround. Filling-in dramatically
reveals the dissociation between the retinal input and the percept, and raises
fundamental questions about how these two relate to each other. Filling-in is
observed in various situations, and is an essential part of our normal surface
perception. Here, I review recent experiments examining brain activities
associated with filling-in, and discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying
this remarkable perceptual phenomenon. The evidence shows that neuronal
activities in early visual cortical areas are involved in filling-in, providing
new insights into visual cortical functions.

The quest to disentangle the aetiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been
heavily influenced by the genes associated with the disease. The
alpha-synuclein-centric theory of protein aggregation with the adjunct of
parkin-driven proteasome deregulation has, in recent years, been complemented by 
the discovery and increasing knowledge of the functions of DJ1, PINK1 and
OMI/HTRA2, which are all associated with the mitochondria and have been
implicated in cellular protection against oxidative damage. We critically review 
how these genes fit into and enhance our understanding of the role of
mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, and consider how oxidative
stress might be a potential unifying factor in the aetiopathogenesis of the
disease.

Recent work on glial cell physiology has revealed that glial cells, and
astrocytes in particular, are much more actively involved in brain information
processing than previously thought. This finding has stimulated the view that the
active brain should no longer be regarded solely as a network of neuronal
contacts, but instead as a circuit of integrated, interactive neurons and glial
cells. Consequently, glial cells could also have as yet unexpected roles in the
diseased brain. An improved understanding of astrocyte biology and heterogeneity 
and the involvement of these cells in pathogenesis offers the potential for
developing novel strategies to treat neurological disorders.

The adult brain is a plastic place. To ensure that the mature nervous system's
control of behaviour is flexible in the face of a varying environment,
morphological and physiological changes are possible at many levels, including
that of the entire cell. In two areas of the adult brain - the olfactory bulb and
the dentate gyrus - new neurons are generated throughout life and form an
integral part of the normal functional circuitry. This process is not fixed, but 
highly modulated, revealing a plastic mechanism by which the brain's performance 
can be optimized for a given environment. The functional benefits of this
whole-cell plasticity, however, remain a matter for debate.

Behavioural and neurophysiological evidence convincingly establish that the left 
hemisphere is dominant for motor skills that are carried out with either hand or 
those that require bimanual coordination. As well as this prioritization, we
argue that specialized functions of the right hemisphere are also indispensable
for the realization of goal-directed behaviour. As such, lateralization of motor 
function is a dynamic and multifaceted process that emerges across different
timescales and is contingent on task- and performer-related determinants.

All available antidepressant medications are based on serendipitous discoveries
of the clinical efficacy of two classes of antidepressants more than 50 years
ago. These tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants were
subsequently found to promote serotonin or noradrenaline function in the brain.
Newer agents are more specific but have the same core mechanisms of action in
promoting these monoamine neurotransmitters. This is unfortunate, because only
approximately 50% of individuals with depression show full remission in response 
to these mechanisms. This review summarizes the obstacles that have hindered the 
development of non-monoamine-based antidepressants, and provides a progress
report on some of the most promising current strategies.

Neuropeptides that are released from dendrites, such as oxytocin and vasopressin,
function as autocrine or paracrine signals at their site of origin, but can also 
act at distant brain targets to evoke long-lasting changes in behaviour.
Oxytocin, for instance, has profound effects on social bonding that are exerted
at sites that richly express oxytocin receptors, but which are innervated by few,
if any, oxytocin-containing projections. How can a prolonged, diffuse signal have
coherent behavioural consequences? The recently demonstrated ability of
neuropeptides to prime vesicle stores for activity-dependent release could lead
to a temporary functional reorganization of neuronal networks harbouring specific
peptide receptors, providing a substrate for long-lasting effects.

Ca(2+) signals have profound and varied effects on growth cone motility and
guidance. Modulation of Ca(2+) influx and release from stores by guidance cues
shapes Ca(2+) signals, which determine the activation of downstream targets.
Although the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie distinct Ca(2+)-mediated 
effects on growth cone behaviours remain unclear, recent studies have identified 
important players in both the regulation and targets of Ca(2+) signals in growth 
cones.

Dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube has a crucial role in shaping the
functional organization of the CNS. It is well established that hedgehog
signalling plays a key role in specifying ventral cell types throughout the
neuroectoderm, and major progress has been made in elucidating how hedgehog
signalling works in this ventral specification. In addition, other molecular
pathways, including nodal, retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor signalling,
have been identified as important molecular cues for ventral patterning of the
spinal cord, telencephalon and eye. Here, we discuss recent advances in this
field, highlighting the emerging interplay of these signalling pathways in the
molecular specification of ventral patterning at different rostrocaudal levels of
the CNS.

Signals through the Notch receptors are used throughout development to control
cellular fate choices. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed both the
pleiotropic action of the Notch signalling pathway in development and the
potential of Notch signals as tools to influence the developmental path of
undifferentiated cells. As we review here, Notch signalling affects the
development of the nervous system at many different levels. Understanding the
complex genetic circuitry that allows Notch signals to affect specific cell fates
in a context-specific manner defines the next challenge, especially as such an
understanding might have important implications for regenerative medicine.

Neural stem cells are a self-renewing population that generates the neurons and
glia of the developing brain. They can be isolated, proliferated, genetically
manipulated and differentiated in vitro and reintroduced into a developing, adult
or pathologically altered CNS. Neural stem cells have been considered for use in 
cell replacement therapies in various neurodegenerative diseases, and an
unexpected and potentially valuable characteristic of these cells has recently
been revealed--they are highly migratory and seem to be attracted to areas of
brain pathology such as ischaemic and neoplastic lesions. Here, we speculate on
the ways in which neural stem cells might be exploited as delivery vehicles for
gene therapy in the CNS.

Emotional events often attain a privileged status in memory. Cognitive
neuroscientists have begun to elucidate the psychological and neural mechanisms
underlying emotional retention advantages in the human brain. The amygdala is a
brain structure that directly mediates aspects of emotional learning and
facilitates memory operations in other regions, including the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex. Emotion-memory interactions occur at various stages of
information processing, from the initial encoding and consolidation of memory
traces to their long-term retrieval. Recent advances are revealing new insights
into the reactivation of latent emotional associations and the recollection of
personal episodes from the remote past.

The blood-brain barrier, which is formed by the endothelial cells that line
cerebral microvessels, has an important role in maintaining a precisely regulated
microenvironment for reliable neuronal signalling. At present, there is great
interest in the association of brain microvessels, astrocytes and neurons to form
functional 'neurovascular units', and recent studies have highlighted the
importance of brain endothelial cells in this modular organization. Here, we
explore specific interactions between the brain endothelium, astrocytes and
neurons that may regulate blood-brain barrier function. An understanding of how
these interactions are disturbed in pathological conditions could lead to the
development of new protective and restorative therapies.

The mechanisms involved in plasticity in the nervous system are thought to
support cognition, and some of these processes are affected during normal ageing.
Notably, cognitive functions that rely on the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal
cortex, such as learning, memory and executive function, show considerable
age-related decline. It is therefore not surprising that several neural
mechanisms in these brain areas also seem to be particularly vulnerable during
the ageing process. In this review, we discuss major advances in our
understanding of age-related changes in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal
cortex and how these changes in functional plasticity contribute to behavioural
impairments in the absence of significant pathology.

Cochlear hair cells respond with phenomenal speed and sensitivity to sound
vibrations that cause submicron deflections of their hair bundle. Outer hair
cells are not only detectors, but also generate force to augment auditory
sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Two mechanisms of force production have
been proposed: contractions of the cell body or active motion of the hair bundle.
Here, we describe recently identified proteins involved in the sensory and motor 
functions of auditory hair cells and present evidence for each force generator.
Both motor mechanisms are probably needed to provide the high sensitivity and
frequency discrimination of the mammalian cochlea.

Oligodendrocyte precursors first arise in a restricted ventral part of the
embryonic spinal cord and migrate laterally and dorsally from there. Later,
secondary sources develop in the dorsal cord. Normally, the ventrally-derived
precursors compete with and suppress their dorsal counterparts. There are also
ventral and dorsal sources in the forebrain, but here the more dorsal precursors 
prevail and the ventral-most lineage is eliminated during postnatal life. How do 
the different populations compete and what is the outcome of the competition? Do 
different embryonic origins signify different functional subgroups of
oligodendrocyte?

Self-motion disturbs the stability of retinal images by inducing optic flow.
Objects of interest need to be fixated or tracked, yet these eye movements can
infringe on the experienced retinal flow that is important for visual navigation.
Separating the components of optic flow caused by an eye movement from those due 
to self-motion, as well as using optic flow for visual navigation while
simultaneously maintaining visual acuity on near targets, represent key
challenges for the visual system. Here we summarize recent advances in our
understanding of how the visuomotor and vestibulomotor systems function and
interact, given the complex task of compensating for instabilities of retinal
images, which typically vary as a function of retinal location and differ for
each eye.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling, particularly signalling
from the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) members of this protein family, is
crucial for the development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems in
vertebrates. Experimental embryology and genetics performed in a range of
organisms are providing insights into how BMPs establish the neural tissue and
control the types and numbers of neurons formed. These studies also highlight the
interactions between different developmental signals that are necessary to form a
functional nervous system. The challenges ahead will be to uncover functions of
TGFbeta signalling in later stages of CNS development, as well as to determine
possible associations with neurological diseases.

The cerebral cortex is the largest and most intricately connected part of the
mammalian brain. Its size and complexity has increased during the course of
evolution, allowing improvements in old functions and causing the emergence of
new ones, such as language. This has expanded the behavioural and cognitive
repertoire of different species and has determined their competitive success. To 
allow the relatively rapid emergence of large evolutionary changes in a structure
of such importance and complexity, the mechanisms by which cortical circuitry
develops must be flexible and yet robust against changes that could disrupt the
normal functions of the networks.

Several neurological diseases are characterized by the altered activity of one or
a few ubiquitously expressed cell proteins, but it is not known how these normal 
proteins turn into harmful executors of selective neuronal cell death. We
selected huntingtin in Huntington's disease to explore this question because the 
dominant inheritance pattern of the disease seems to exclude the possibility that
the wild-type protein has a role in the natural history of this condition.
However, even in this extreme case, there is considerable evidence that normal
huntingtin is important for neuronal function and that the activity of some of
its downstream effectors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, is reduced
in Huntington's disease.

The matrix metalloproteinases and related A disintegrin and metalloproteinase
enzymes are implicated in various diseases of the nervous system. However,
metalloproteinases are increasingly being recognized as having beneficial roles
during nervous system development and following injury. This review discusses
general principles that govern the expression of metalloproteinases in the
nervous system and their detrimental outcomes. It then focuses on the roles of
metalloproteinases and their mechanisms in regulating neurogenesis, myelin
formation and axonal growth. It is clear that metalloproteinases are important
determinants in enabling recovery from injury to the nervous system.

The concept of death has evolved as technology has progressed. This has forced
medicine and society to redefine its ancient cardiorespiratory centred diagnosis 
to a neurocentric diagnosis of death. The apparent consensus about the definition
of death has not yet appeased all controversy. Ethical, moral and religious
concerns continue to surface and include a prevailing malaise about possible
expansions of the definition of death to encompass the vegetative state or about 
the feared bias of formulating criteria so as to facilitate organ
transplantation.

Neuronal circuits in the brain are shaped by experience during 'critical periods'
in early postnatal life. In the primary visual cortex, this activity-dependent
development is triggered by the functional maturation of local inhibitory
connections and driven by a specific, late-developing subset of interneurons.
Ultimately, the structural consolidation of competing sensory inputs is mediated 
by a proteolytic reorganization of the extracellular matrix that occurs only
during the critical period. The reactivation of this process, and subsequent
recovery of function in conditions such as amblyopia, can now be studied with
realistic circuit models that might generalize across systems.

The dentate gyrus provides the main input to the hippocampus. Information reaches
the CA3 region through mossy fibre synapses made by dentate granule cell axons.
Synaptic plasticity at the mossy fibre-pyramidal cell synapse is unusual for
several reasons, including low basal release probability, pronounced frequency
facilitation and a lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor involvement in long-term
potentiation. In the past few years, some of the mechanisms underlying the
peculiar features of mossy fibre synapses have been elucidated. Here we describe 
recent work from several laboratories on the various forms of synaptic plasticity
at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses. We conclude that these contacts have just
begun to reveal their many secrets.

K(+) channels play a crucial role in regulating the excitability of neurons. Many
K(+) channels are, in turn, regulated by neurotransmitters. One of the first
neurotransmitter-regulated channels to be identified, some 25 years ago, was the 
M channel. This was categorized as such because its activity was inhibited
through stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. M channels are now
known to be composed of subunits of the Kv7 (KCNQ) K(+) channel family. However, 
until recently, the link between the receptors and the channels has remained
elusive. Here, we summarize recent developments that have begun to clarify this
link and discuss their implications for physiology and medicine.

Why is the characteristic timescale of neural information processing in the
millisecond range, corresponding to a 'clock speed' of about 1 kHz, whereas the
clock speed of modern computers is about 3 GHz? Here we investigate how the
brain's energy supply limits the maximum rate at which the brain can compute, and
how the molecular components of excitatory synapses have evolved properties that 
are matched to the information processing they perform.

Mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is classically
associated with non-shivering thermogenesis by brown fat. Recent evidence
indicates that UCP family proteins are also present in selected neurons. Unlike
UCP1, these proteins (UCP2, UCP4 and BMCP1/UCP5) are not constitutive uncouplers 
and are not crucial for non-shivering thermogenesis. However, they can be
activated by free radicals and free fatty acids, and their activity has a
profound influence on neuronal function. By regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, 
calcium flux, free radical production and local temperature, neuronal UCPs can
directly influence neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative
processes. Insights into the regulation and function of these proteins offer
unsuspected avenues for a better understanding of synaptic transmission and
neurodegeneration.

A wide range of insults can trigger axon degeneration, and axons respond with
diverse morphology, topology and speed. However, recent genetic, immunochemical, 
morphological and pharmacological investigations point to convergent degeneration
mechanisms. The principal convergence points - poor axonal transport,
mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in intra-axonal calcium - have been
identified by rescuing axons with the slow Wallerian degeneration gene (Wld(S))
and studies with blockers of sodium or calcium influx. By understanding how the
pathways fit together, we can combine our knowledge of mechanisms, and
potentially also treatment strategies, from different axonal disorders.

Characterizing the functional phenotypes of neurons is essential for
understanding how genotypes can be related to the neural basis of behaviour.
Traditional classifications of neurons by single features (such as morphology or 
firing behaviour) are increasingly inadequate for reflecting functional
phenotypes, as they do not integrate functions across different neuronal types.
Here, we describe a set of rules for identifying and predicting functional
phenotypes that combine morphology, intrinsic ion channel species and their
distributions in dendrites, and functional properties. This more comprehensive
neuronal classification should be an improvement on traditional classifications
for relating genotype to functional phenotype.

Moral cognitive neuroscience is an emerging field of research that focuses on the
neural basis of uniquely human forms of social cognition and behaviour. Recent
functional imaging and clinical evidence indicates that a remarkably consistent
network of brain regions is involved in moral cognition. These findings are
fostering new interpretations of social behavioural impairments in patients with 
brain dysfunction, and require new approaches to enable us to understand the
complex links between individuals and society. Here, we propose a cognitive
neuroscience view of how cultural and context-dependent knowledge, semantic
social knowledge and motivational states can be integrated to explain complex
aspects of human moral cognition.

In recent years there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the
circuitry of the basal ganglia and our ability to predict the behavioural effects
of specific cellular changes in this circuit on voluntary movement. These
advances, combined with a new understanding of the rich distribution and diverse 
physiological roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the basal ganglia,
indicate that these receptors might have a key role in motor control and raise
the exciting possibility that they might provide therapeutic targets for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

Recent functional imaging, neuropsychological and electrophysiological studies on
adults have provided evidence for a fast, low-spatial-frequency, subcortical
face-detection pathway that modulates the responses of certain cortical areas to 
faces and other social stimuli. These findings shed light on an older literature 
on the face-detection abilities of newborn infants, and the hypothesis that these
newborn looking preferences are generated by a subcortical route. Converging
lines of evidence indicate that the subcortical face route provides a
developmental foundation for what later becomes the adult cortical 'social brain'
network, and that disturbances to this pathway might contribute to certain
developmental disorders.

Time is a fundamental dimension of life. It is crucial for decisions about
quantity, speed of movement and rate of return, as well as for motor control in
walking, speech, playing or appreciating music, and participating in sports.
Traditionally, the way in which time is perceived, represented and estimated has 
been explained using a pacemaker-accumulator model that is not only
straightforward, but also surprisingly powerful in explaining behavioural and
biological data. However, recent advances have challenged this traditional view. 
It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and
tells the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural
populations.

Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute 
CNS injury. It has recently become clear that CNS injury significantly increases 
susceptibility to infection by brain-specific mechanisms: CNS injury induces a
disturbance of the normally well balanced interplay between the immune system and
the CNS. As a result, CNS injury leads to secondary immunodeficiency - CNS
injury-induced immunodepression (CIDS) - and infection. CIDS might serve as a
model for the study of the mechanisms and mediators of brain control over
immunity. More importantly, understanding CIDS will allow us to work on
developing effective therapeutic strategies, with which the outcome after CNS
damage by a host of diseases could be improved by eliminating a major determinant
of poor recovery.

New mRNA must be transcribed in order to consolidate changes in synaptic
strength. But how are events at the synapse communicated to the nucleus? Some
research has shown that proteins can move from activated synapses to the nucleus.
However, other work has shown that action potentials can directly inform the
nucleus about cellular activation. Here we contend that action potential-induced 
signalling to the nucleus best meets the requirements of the consolidation of
synapse-specific plasticity, which include both timing and stoichiometric
constraints.

Hedonic experience is arguably at the heart of what makes us human. In recent
neuroimaging studies of the cortical networks that mediate hedonic experience in 
the human brain, the orbitofrontal cortex has emerged as the strongest candidate 
for linking food and other types of reward to hedonic experience. The
orbitofrontal cortex is among the least understood regions of the human brain,
but has been proposed to be involved in sensory integration, in representing the 
affective value of reinforcers, and in decision making and expectation. Here, the
functional neuroanatomy of the human orbitofrontal cortex is described and a new 
integrated model of its functions proposed, including a possible role in the
mediation of hedonic experience.

The evolution of complex nervous systems in vertebrates has been accompanied by, 
and probably dependent on, the acquisition of the myelin sheath. Although there
has been substantial progress in our understanding of the factors that determine 
glial cell fate, much less is known about the cellular mechanisms that determine 
how the myelin sheath is extended and stabilized around axons. This review
highlights four crucial stages of myelination, namely, the selection of axons and
initiation of cell-cell interactions between them and glial cells, the
establishment of stable intercellular contact and assembly of the nodes of
Ranvier, regulation of myelin thickness and, finally, longitudinal extension of
myelin segments in response to the lengthening of axons during postnatal growth.

During the development of peripheral nerves, neural crest cells generate
myelinating and non-myelinating glial cells in a process that parallels
gliogenesis from the germinal layers of the CNS. Unlike central gliogenesis,
neural crest development involves a protracted embryonic phase devoted to the
generation of, first, the Schwann cell precursor and then the immature Schwann
cell, a cell whose fate as a myelinating or non-myelinating cell has yet to be
determined. Embryonic nerves therefore offer a particular opportunity to analyse 
the early steps of gliogenesis from transient multipotent stem cells, and to
understand how this process is integrated with organogenesis of peripheral
nerves.

People have always been fascinated by the exquisite precision and flexibility of 
the human hand. When hand meets object, we confront the overlapping worlds of
sensorimotor and cognitive functions. We reach for objects, grasp and lift them, 
manipulate them and use them to act on other objects. This review examines one of
these actions--grasping. Recent research in behavioural neuroscience,
neuroimaging and electrophysiology has the potential to reveal where in the brain
the process of grasping is organized, but has yet to address several questions
about the sensorimotor transformations that relate to the control of the hands.

Diverse animals can detect magnetic fields but little is known about how they do 
so. Three main hypotheses of magnetic field perception have been proposed.
Electrosensitive marine fish might detect the Earth's field through
electromagnetic induction, but direct evidence that induction underlies
magnetoreception in such fish has not been obtained. Studies in other animals
have provided evidence that is consistent with two other mechanisms: biogenic
magnetite and chemical reactions that are modulated by weak magnetic fields.
Despite recent advances, however, magnetoreceptors have not been identified with 
certainty in any animal, and the mode of transduction for the magnetic sense
remains unknown.

Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of
undegradable molecules in cells or at extracellular sites in the brain. One such 
family of diseases is the lysosomal storage disorders, which result from defects 
in various aspects of lysosomal function. Until recently, there was little
prospect of treating storage diseases involving the CNS. However, recent progress
has been made in understanding these conditions and in translating the findings
into experimental therapies. We review the developments in this field and discuss
the similarities in pathological features between these diseases and some more
common neurodegenerative disorders.

Forty-five years ago, Roger Sperry, Joseph Bogen and I embarked on what are now
known as the modern split-brain studies. These experiments opened up new
frontiers in brain research and gave rise to much of what we know about
hemispheric specialization and integration. The latest developments in
split-brain research build on the groundwork laid by those early studies.
Split-brain methodology, on its own and in conjunction with neuroimaging, has
yielded insights into the remarkable regional specificity of the corpus callosum 
as well as into the integrative role of the callosum in the perception of
causality and in our perception of an integrated sense of self.

Faces convey a wealth of social signals. A dominant view in face-perception
research has been that the recognition of facial identity and facial expression
involves separable visual pathways at the functional and neural levels, and data 
from experimental, neuropsychological, functional imaging and cell-recording
studies are commonly interpreted within this framework. However, the existing
evidence supports this model less strongly than is often assumed. Alongside this 
two-pathway framework, other possible models of facial identity and expression
recognition, including one that has emerged from principal component analysis
techniques, should be considered.

Neuronal connections are established and refined through a series of
developmental programs that involve axon and dendrite specification, process
growth, target innervation, cell death and synaptogenesis. Many of these
developmental events are regulated by target-derived neurotrophins and their
receptors, which signal retrogradely over long distances from distal-most axons
to neuronal cell bodies. Recent work has established many of the cellular and
molecular events that underlie retrograde signalling and the importance of these 
events for both development and maintenance of proper neural connectivity.

Neurotrophins have diverse functions in the CNS. Initially synthesized as
precursors (proneurotrophins), they are cleaved to produce mature proteins, which
promote neuronal survival and enhance synaptic plasticity by activating Trk
receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent studies indicate that proneurotrophins serve as
signalling molecules by interacting with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). 
Interestingly, proneurotrophins often have biological effects that oppose those
of mature neurotrophins. Therefore, the proteolytic cleavage of proneurotrophins 
represents a mechanism that controls the direction of action of neurotrophins.
New insights into the 'yin and yang' of neurotrophin activity have profound
implications for our understanding of the role of neurotrophins in a wide range
of cellular processes.

For decades, astrocytes have been considered to be non-excitable support cells of
the brain. However, this view has changed radically during the past twenty years.
The recent recognition that they are organized in separate territories and
possess active properties--notably a competence for the regulated release of
'gliotransmitters', including glutamate--has enabled us to develop an
understanding of previously unknown functions for astrocytes. Today, astrocytes
are seen as local communication elements of the brain that can generate various
regulatory signals and bridge structures (from neuronal to vascular) and networks
that are otherwise disconnected from each other. Examples of their specific and
essential roles in normal physiological processes have begun to accumulate, and
the number of diseases known to involve defective astrocytes is increasing.

Resistance to drug treatment is an important hurdle in the therapy of many brain 
disorders, including brain cancer, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression and
infection of the brain with HIV. Consequently, there is a pressing need to
develop new and more effective treatment strategies. Mechanisms of resistance
that operate in cancer and infectious diseases might also be relevant in
drug-resistant brain disorders. In particular, drug efflux transporters that are 
expressed at the blood-brain barrier limit the ability of many drugs to access
the brain. There is increasing evidence that drug efflux transporters have an
important role in drug-resistant brain disorders, and this information should
allow more efficacious treatment strategies to be developed.

Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the neurobiological
mechanisms of the placebo effect, and most of our knowledge originates from the
field of pain and analgesia. Today, the placebo effect represents a promising
model that could allow us to shed new light on mind-body interactions. The mental
events induced by placebo administration can activate mechanisms that are similar
to those activated by drugs, which indicates a similarity between psychosocial
and pharmacodynamic effects. These new neurobiological advances are already
changing our conception of how clinical trials and medical practice must be
viewed and conducted.

Acute pain and emotion are processed in two forebrain networks, and the cingulate
cortex is involved in both. Although Brodmann's cingulate gyrus had two divisions
and was not based on any functional criteria, functional imaging studies still
use this model. However, recent cytoarchitectural studies of the cingulate gyrus 
support a four-region model, with subregions, that is based on connections and
qualitatively unique functions. Although the activity evoked by pain and emotion 
has been widely reported, some view them as emergent products of the brain rather
than of small aggregates of neurons. Here, we assess pain and emotion in each
cingulate subregion, and assess whether pain is co-localized with negative
affect. Amazingly, these activation patterns do not simply overlap.

During the past two decades, an important focus of pain research has been the
study of chronic pain mechanisms, particularly the processes that lead to the
abnormal sensitivity - spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia - that is associated
with these states. For some time it has been recognized that inflammatory
mediators released from immune cells can contribute to these persistent pain
states. However, it has only recently become clear that immune cell products
might have a crucial role not just in inflammatory pain, but also in neuropathic 
pain caused by damage to peripheral nerves or to the CNS.

The study of pain development has come into its own. Reaping the rewards of years
of developmental and molecular biology, it has now become possible to translate
fundamental knowledge of signalling pathways and synaptic physiology into a
better understanding of infant pain. Research has cast new light on the
physiological and pharmacological processes that shape the newborn pain response,
which will help us to understand early pain behaviour and to design better
treatments. Furthermore, it has shown how developing pain circuitry depends on
non-noxious sensory activity in the healthy newborn, and how early injury can
permanently alter pain processing.

Fifteen years ago, cell lineage restriction boundaries were discovered in the
embryonic vertebrate hindbrain, subdividing it into a series of cell-tight
compartments (known as rhombomeres). Compartition, together with segmentally
reiterative neuronal architecture and the nested expression of Hox genes,
indicates that the hindbrain has a truly metameric organization. This finding
initiated a search for compartments in other regions of the developing brain. The
results of recent studies have clarified where compartment boundaries exist, have
shed light on molecular mechanisms that underlie their formation and have
revealed an important function of these boundaries: the positioning and
stabilization of local signalling centres.

Hospital and Medical School, Dundee University, Dundee DD19SY, UK.

GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors mediate most of the 'fast'
synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain and are targeted by many clinically
important drugs. Certain naturally occurring pregnane steroids can potently and
specifically enhance GABA(A) receptor function in a nongenomic (direct) manner,
and consequently have anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic
and anaesthetic properties. These steroids not only act as remote endocrine
messengers, but also can be synthesized in the brain, where they modify neuronal 
activity locally by modulating GABA(A) receptor function. Such 'neurosteroids'
can influence mood and behaviour in various physiological and pathophysiological 
situations, and might contribute to the behavioural effects of psychoactive
drugs.

For a long time the cortical systems for language and actions were believed to be
independent modules. However, as these systems are reciprocally connected with
each other, information about language and actions might interact in distributed 
neuronal assemblies. A critical case is that of action words that are
semantically related to different parts of the body (for example, 'lick', 'pick' 
and 'kick'): does the comprehension of these words specifically, rapidly and
automatically activate the motor system in a somatotopic manner, and does their
comprehension rely on activity in the action system?

Erythropoietin mediates an evolutionarily conserved, ancient immune response that
limits damage to the heart, the nervous system and other tissues following
injury. New evidence indicates that erythropoietin specifically prevents the
destruction of viable tissue surrounding the site of an injury by signalling
through a non-haematopoietic receptor. Engineered derivatives of erythropoietin
that have a high affinity for this receptor have been developed, and these show
robust tissue-protective effects in diverse preclinical models without
stimulating erythropoiesis. A recent successful proof-of-concept clinical trial
that used erythropoietin to treat human patients who had suffered a stroke
encourages the evaluation of both this cytokine and non-erythropoietic
derivatives as therapeutic agents to limit tissue injury.

Vertebrate spinal cord and brainstem central pattern generator (CPG) circuits
share profound similarities with neocortical circuits. CPGs can produce
meaningful functional output in the absence of sensory inputs. Neocortical
circuits could be considered analogous to CPGs as they have rich spontaneous
dynamics that, similar to CPGs, are powerfully modulated or engaged by sensory
inputs, but can also generate output in their absence. We find compelling
evidence for this argument at the anatomical, biophysical, developmental, dynamic
and pathological levels of analysis. Although it is possible that cortical
circuits are particularly plastic types of CPG ('learning CPGs'), we argue that
present knowledge about CPGs is likely to foretell the basic principles of the
organization and dynamic function of cortical circuits.

Since the time of Pythagoras, numerical and spatial representations have been
inextricably linked. We suggest that the relationship between the two is deeply
rooted in the brain's organization for these capacities. Many behavioural and
patient studies have shown that numerical-spatial interactions run far deeper
than simply cultural constructions, and, instead, influence behaviour at several 
levels. By combining two previously independent lines of research, neuroimaging
studies of numerical cognition in humans, and physiological studies of spatial
cognition in monkeys, we propose that these numerical-spatial interactions arise 
from common parietal circuits for attention to external space and internal
representations of numbers.

Short-term and long-term changes in the strength of synapses in neural networks
underlie working memory and long-term memory storage in the brain. These changes 
are regulated by many biochemical signalling pathways in the postsynaptic spines 
of excitatory synapses. Recent findings about the roles and regulation of the
small GTPases Ras, Rap and Rac in spines provide new insights into the
coordination and cooperation of different pathways to effect synaptic plasticity.
Here, we present an initial working representation of the interactions of five
signalling cascades that are usually studied individually. We discuss their
integrated function in the regulation of postsynaptic plasticity.

The use of zinc in medicinal skin cream was mentioned in Egyptian papyri from
2000 BC (for example, the Smith Papyrus), and zinc has apparently been used
fairly steadily throughout Roman and modern times (for example, as the American
lotion named for its zinc ore, 'Calamine'). It is, therefore, somewhat ironic
that zinc is a relatively late addition to the pantheon of signal ions in biology
and medicine. However, the number of biological functions, health implications
and pharmacological targets that are emerging for zinc indicate that it might
turn out to be 'the calcium of the twenty-first century'.

In response to stress, the brain activates several neuropeptide-secreting
systems. This eventually leads to the release of adrenal corticosteroid hormones,
which subsequently feed back on the brain and bind to two types of nuclear
receptor that act as transcriptional regulators. By targeting many genes,
corticosteroids function in a binary fashion, and serve as a master switch in the
control of neuronal and network responses that underlie behavioural adaptation.
In genetically predisposed individuals, an imbalance in this binary control
mechanism can introduce a bias towards stress-related brain disease after adverse
experiences. New candidate susceptibility genes that serve as markers for the
prediction of vulnerable phenotypes are now being identified.

Cortical neurons show irregular but structured spike trains. This has been
interpreted as evidence for 'temporal coding', whereby stimuli are represented by
precise spike-timing patterns. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation
based on the older concept of the cell assembly. The dynamic evolution of
assembly sequences, which are steered but not deterministically controlled by
sensory input, is the proposed substrate of psychological processes beyond simple
stimulus-response associations. Accordingly, spike trains show a temporal
structure that is stimulus-dependent and more variable than would be predicted by
strict sensory control. We propose four signatures of assembly organization that 
can be experimentally tested. We argue that many observations that have been
interpreted as evidence for temporal coding might instead reflect an underlying
assembly structure.

Sensory, motor and cortical neurons fire impulses or spikes at a regular, but
slowly declining, rate in response to a constant current stimulus. Yet, the
intervals between spikes often vary randomly during behaviour. Is this variation 
an unavoidable effect of generating spikes by sensory or synaptic processes
('neural noise') or is it an important part of the 'signal' that is transmitted
to other neurons? Here, we mainly discuss this question in relation to sensory
and motor processes, as the signals are best identified in such systems, although
we also touch on central processes.

The mental retardation protein FMRP is involved in the transport of mRNAs and
their translation at synapses. Patients with fragile X syndrome, in whom FMRP is 
absent or mutated, show deficits in learning and memory that might reflect
impairments in the translational regulation of a subset of neuronal mRNAs. The
study of FMRP provides important insights into the regulation and functions of
local protein synthesis in the neuronal periphery, and increases our
understanding of how these functions can produce specific effects at individual
synapses.

WNT signalling has a key role in early embryonic patterning through the
regulation of cell fate decisions, tissue polarity and cell movements. In the
nervous system, WNT signalling also regulates neuronal connectivity by
controlling axon pathfinding, axon remodelling, dendrite morphogenesis and
synapse formation. Studies, from invertebrates to mammals, have led to a
considerable understanding of WNT signal transduction pathways. This knowledge
provides a framework for the study of the mechanisms by which WNTs regulate
diverse neuronal functions. Manipulation of the WNT pathways could provide new
strategies for nerve regeneration and neuronal circuit modulation.

To make adaptive decisions, animals must evaluate the costs and benefits of
available options. The nascent field of neuroeconomics has set itself the
ambitious goal of understanding the brain mechanisms that are responsible for
these evaluative processes. A series of recent neurophysiological studies in
monkeys has begun to address this challenge using novel methods to manipulate and
measure an animal's internal valuation of competing alternatives. By emphasizing 
the behavioural mechanisms and neural signals that mediate decision making under 
conditions of uncertainty, these studies might lay the foundation for an emerging
neurobiology of choice behaviour.

Immersive virtual environments can break the deep, everyday connection between
where our senses tell us we are and where we are actually located and whom we are
with. The concept of 'presence' refers to the phenomenon of behaving and feeling 
as if we are in the virtual world created by computer displays. In this article, 
we argue that presence is worthy of study by neuroscientists, and that it might
aid the study of perception and consciousness.

'Statins' are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors - oral
cholesterol-lowering drugs that are used to treat hypercholesterolaemia. It is
widely accepted that statins have anti-inflammatory effects that are independent 
of their ability to lower cholesterol. Animal studies and observational clinical 
studies have indicated that statins might also be effective in treating certain
neurological diseases - in particular, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease
and ischaemic stroke. At present, however, results from ongoing prospective,
randomized clinical trials are not available.

Impairments in certain cognitive functions, such as working memory, are core
features of schizophrenia. Convergent findings indicate that a deficiency in
signalling through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor leads to reduced GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesis in the parvalbumin-containing subpopulation
of inhibitory GABA neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals
with schizophrenia. Despite both pre- and postsynaptic compensatory responses,
the resulting alteration in perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons
contributes to a diminished capacity for the gamma-frequency synchronized
neuronal activity that is required for working memory function. These findings
reveal specific targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive
function in individuals with schizophrenia.

A coordinated movement is easy to recognize, but we know little about how it is
achieved. In search of the neural basis of coordination, we present a model of
spinocerebellar interactions in which the structure-functional organizing
principle is a division of the cerebellum into discrete microcomplexes. Each
microcomplex is the recipient of a specific motor error signal - that is, a
signal that conveys information about an inappropriate movement. These signals
are encoded by spinal reflex circuits and conveyed to the cerebellar cortex
through climbing fibre afferents. This organization reveals salient features of
cerebellar information processing, but also highlights the importance of systems 
level analysis for a fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie 
behaviour.

The huge number of neurons in the human brain are connected to form functionally 
specialized assemblies. The brain's amazing processing capabilities rest on local
communication within and long-range communication between these assemblies. Even 
simple sensory, motor and cognitive tasks depend on the precise coordination of
many brain areas. Recent improvements in the methods of studying long-range
communication have allowed us to address several important questions. What are
the common mechanisms that govern local and long-range communication and how do
they relate to the structure of the brain? How does oscillatory synchronization
subserve neural communication? And what are the consequences of abnormal
synchronization?

A recent flurry of time-lapse imaging studies of live neurons have tried to
address the century-old question: what morphological changes in dendritic spines 
can be related to long-term memory? Changes that have been proposed to relate to 
memory include the formation of new spines, the enlargement of spine heads and
the pruning of spines. These observations also relate to a more general question 
of how stable dendritic spines are. The objective of this review is to critically
assess the new data and to propose much needed criteria that relate spines to
memory, thereby allowing progress in understanding the morphological basis of
memory.

The role of calmodulin as a signal integrator for synaptic plasticity.

Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.

Excitatory synapses in the brain show several forms of synaptic plasticity,
including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are 
initiated by increases in intracellular Ca(2+) that are generated through NMDA
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors or voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels. LTP
depends on the coordinated regulation of an ensemble of enzymes, including
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, adenylyl cyclase 1 and 8, and
calcineurin, all of which are stimulated by calmodulin, a Ca(2+)-binding protein.
In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that calmodulin is a central integrator
of synaptic plasticity and that its unique regulatory properties allow the
integration of several forms of signal transduction that are required for LTP and
LTD.

The study of implicit perception - perception in the absence of awareness - has a
long history. Decades of behavioural work have identified crucial theoretical and
methodological issues that must be considered when evaluating claims of implicit 
perception. Neuroimaging methods provide an important new avenue for illuminating
our understanding of perception both with and without awareness, but most imaging
experiments have not met the rigorous conditions that the behavioural work has
shown are necessary for inferring implicit perception. Here, we review the
literature of both behavioural and neuroimaging studies, and note the pitfalls of
studying implicit perception as well as the promise that neuroimaging studies
have for providing insights about implicit perception when combined with
appropriately rigorous behavioural measures of awareness.

The chemical hypothesis of depression suggests that mood disorders are caused by 
a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can be corrected by antidepressant
drugs. However, recent evidence indicates that problems in information processing
within neural networks, rather than changes in chemical balance, might underlie
depression, and that antidepressant drugs induce plastic changes in neuronal
connectivity, which gradually lead to improvements in neuronal information
processing and recovery of mood.

One of the key organizers in the CNS is the floor plate - a group of cells that
is responsible for instructing neural cells to acquire distinctive fates, and
that has an important role in establishing the elaborate neuronal networks that
underlie the function of the brain and spinal cord. In recent years, considerable
controversy has arisen over the mechanism by which floor plate cells form. Here, 
we describe recent evidence that indicates that discrete populations of floor
plate cells, with characteristic molecular properties, form in different regions 
of the neuraxis, and we discuss data that imply that the mode of floor plate
induction varies along the anteroposterior axis.

The proper functioning of the adult mammalian brain relies on the orchestrated
regulation of neural activity by a diverse population of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric
acid)-releasing neurons. Until recently, our appreciation of GABA-mediated
inhibition focused predominantly on the GABA(A) (GABA type A) receptors located
at synaptic contacts, which are activated in a transient or 'phasic' manner by
GABA that is released from synaptic vesicles. However, there is growing evidence 
that low concentrations of ambient GABA can persistently activate certain
subtypes of GABA(A) receptor, which are often remote from synapses, to generate a
'tonic' conductance. In this review, we consider the distinct roles of synaptic
and extrasynaptic GABA receptor subtypes in the control of neuronal excitability.

Gap junctions are channel-forming structures in contacting plasma membranes that 
allow direct metabolic and electrical communication between almost all cell types
in the mammalian brain. At least 20 connexin genes and 3 pannexin genes probably 
code for gap junction proteins in mice and humans. Gap junctions between murine
neurons (also known as electrical synapses) can be composed of connexin 36,
connexin 45 or connexin 57 proteins, depending on the type of neuron.
Furthermore, pannexin 1 and 2 are likely to form electrical synapses. Here, we
discuss the roles of connexin and pannexin genes in the formation of neuronal gap
junctions, and evaluate recent functional analyses of electrical synapses that
became possible through the characterization of mouse mutants that show targeted 
defects in connexin genes.

Intracellular transport is fundamental for neuronal morphogenesis, function and
survival. Many proteins are selectively transported to either axons or dendrites.
In addition, some specific mRNAs are transported to dendrites for local
translation. Proteins of the kinesin superfamily participate in selective
transport by using adaptor or scaffolding proteins to recognize and bind cargoes.
The molecular components of RNA-transporting granules have been identified, and
it is becoming clear how cargoes are directed to axons and dendrites by kinesin
superfamily proteins. Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms of directional
axonal and dendritic transport with specific emphasis on the role of motor
proteins and their mechanisms of cargo recognition.

Numbers are an integral part of our everyday life - we use them to quantify, rank
and identify objects. The verbal number concept allows humans to develop superior
mathematical and logic skills that define technologically advanced cultures.
However, basic numerical competence is rooted in biological primitives that can
be explored in animals, infants and human adults alike. We are now beginning to
unravel its anatomical basis and neuronal mechanisms on many levels, down to its 
single neuron correlate. Neural representations of numerical information can
engage extensive cerebral networks, but the posterior parietal cortex and the
prefrontal cortex are the key structures in primates.

We believe that names have a powerful influence on the experiments we do and the 
way in which we think. For this reason, and in the light of new evidence about
the function and evolution of the vertebrate brain, an international consortium
of neuroscientists has reconsidered the traditional, 100-year-old terminology
that is used to describe the avian cerebrum. Our current understanding of the
avian brain - in particular the neocortex-like cognitive functions of the avian
pallium - requires a new terminology that better reflects these functions and the
homologies between avian and mammalian brains.

Membrane vesicle cycling is orchestrated through the combined actions of proteins
and lipids. At neuronal synapses, this orchestration must meet the stringent
demands of speed, fidelity and sustainability of the synaptic vesicle cycle that 
mediates neurotransmission. Historically, the lion's share of the attention has
been focused on the proteins that are involved in this cycle; but, in recent
years, it has become clear that the previously unheralded plasma membrane and
vesicle lipids are also key regulators of this cycle. This article reviews recent
insights into the roles of lipid-modifying enzymes and lipids in the acute
modulation of neurotransmission.

That speech and language are innate capacities of the human brain has long been
widely accepted, but only recently has an entry point into the genetic basis of
these remarkable faculties been found. The discovery of a mutation in FOXP2 in a 
family with a speech and language disorder has enabled neuroscientists to trace
the neural expression of this gene during embryological development, track the
effects of this gene mutation on brain structure and function, and so begin to
decipher that part of our neural inheritance that culminates in articulate
speech.

A fundamental question in memory research is how our brains can form enduring
memories. In humans, memories of everyday life depend initially on the medial
temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus. As these memories mature, they
are thought to become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the
cortex. Little is understood about how new memories in the hippocampus are
transformed into remote memories in cortical networks. However, recent studies
have begun to shed light on how remote memories are organized in the cortex, and 
the molecular and cellular events that underlie their consolidation.

Sensory working memory consists of the short-term storage of sensory stimuli to
guide behaviour. There is increasing evidence that elemental sensory dimensions -
such as object motion in the visual system or the frequency of a sound in the
auditory system - are stored by segregated feature-selective systems that include
not only the prefrontal and parietal cortex, but also areas of sensory cortex
that carry out relatively early stages of processing. These circuits seem to have
a dual function: precise sensory encoding and short-term storage of this
information. New results provide insights into how activity in these circuits
represents the remembered sensory stimuli.

Discoveries concerning the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation and
development have dictated the definition of a new sub-discipline of genetics
known as epigenetics. Epigenetics refers to a set of self-perpetuating,
post-translational modifications of DNA and nuclear proteins that produce lasting
alterations in chromatin structure as a direct consequence, and lasting
alterations in patterns of gene expression as an indirect consequence. The area
of epigenetics is a burgeoning subfield of genetics in which there is
considerable enthusiasm driving new discoveries. Neurobiologists have only
recently begun to investigate the possible roles of epigenetic mechanisms in
behaviour, physiology and neuropathology. Strikingly, the relevant data from the 
few extant neurobiology-related studies have already indicated a theme -
epigenetic mechanisms probably have an important role in synaptic plasticity and 
memory formation.

Denmark. mlauritz@mfi.ku.dk

A key goal in functional neuroimaging is to use signals that are related to local
changes in metabolism and blood flow to track the neuronal correlates of mental
activity. Recent findings indicate that the dendritic processing of excitatory
synaptic inputs correlates more closely than the generation of spikes with brain 
imaging signals. The correlation is often nonlinear and context-sensitive, and
cannot be generalized for every condition or brain region. The vascular signals
are mainly produced by increases in intracellular calcium in neurons and possibly
astrocytes, which activate important enzymes that produce vasodilators to
generate increments in flow and the positive blood oxygen level dependent signal.
Our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of functional imaging signals places
constraints on the interpretation of the data.

effectively with the visually deprived brain in order to merge what is perceived

Synaptic vesicle pools.

Author information:

Communication between cells reaches its highest degree of specialization at
chemical synapses. Some synapses talk in a 'whisper'; others 'shout'. The
'louder' the synapse, the more synaptic vesicles are needed to maintain effective
transmission, ranging from a few hundred (whisperers) to nearly a million
(shouters). These vesicles reside in different 'pools', which have been given a
bewildering array of names. In this review, we focus on five tissue preparations 
in which synaptic vesicle pools have been identified and thoroughly
characterized. We argue that, in each preparation, each vesicle can be assigned
to one of three distinct pools.

Cholinergic projections to the cortex and hippocampus mediate fundamental
cognitive processes. The capacity of the high-affinity choline uptake transporter
(CHT) to import choline from the extracellular space to presynaptic terminals is 
essential for normal acetylcholine synthesis and therefore cholinergic
transmission. The CHT is highly regulated, and the cellular mechanisms that
modulate its capacity show considerable plasticity. Recent evidence links changes
in CHT capacity with the ability to perform tasks that tax attentional processes 
and capacities. Abnormal regulation of CHT capacity might contribute to the
cognitive impairments that are associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the CHT might represent a productive
target for the development of new pharmacological treatments for these
conditions.

Although non-invasive methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging,
electroencephalograms and magnetoencephalograms provide most of the current data 
about the human brain, their resolution is insufficient to show physiological
processes at the cellular level. Clinical approaches sometimes allow invasive
recordings to be taken from the human brain, mainly in patients with epilepsy or 
with movement disorders, and such recordings can sample neural activity at
spatial scales ranging from single cells to distributed cell assemblies. In
addition to their clinical relevance, these recordings can provide unique
insights into brain functions such as movement control, perception, memory,
language and even consciousness.

Prions--pathogens that are lethal to humans and other animals--are thought to be 
conformational isomers of the cellular prion protein. Their unique biology, and
the potential for a wider pathobiological significance of prion-like mechanisms, 
has motivated much research into understanding prion neurodegeneration. Moreover,
concerns that extensive dietary exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) prions might have infected many individuals--who might eventually develop
its human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)--has focused much
interest on therapeutics. The challenge of interrupting this aggressive, diffuse 
and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative process is daunting. However, the recent
finding that the onset of clinical disease in established neuroinvasive prion
infection in a mouse model can be halted and early pathology reversed is a source
for considerable optimism. A therapeutic focus on the cellular prion protein,
rather than prions themselves, which might not be directly neurotoxic, is
suggested.

Many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by conformational changes in
proteins that result in misfolding, aggregation and intra- or extra-neuronal
accumulation of amyloid fibrils. Molecular chaperones provide a first line of
defence against misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and are among the most
potent suppressors of neurodegeneration known for animal models of human disease.
Recent studies have investigated the role of molecular chaperones in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and polyglutamine
diseases. We propose that molecular chaperones are neuroprotective because of
their ability to modulate the earliest aberrant protein interactions that trigger
pathogenic cascades. A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of
chaperone-mediated protection against neurodegeneration might lead to the
development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with
protein misfolding and aggregation.

Drug addiction manifests as a compulsive drive to take a drug despite serious
adverse consequences. This aberrant behaviour has traditionally been viewed as
bad "choices" that are made voluntarily by the addict. However, recent studies
have shown that repeated drug use leads to long-lasting changes in the brain that
undermine voluntary control. This, combined with new knowledge of how
environmental, genetic and developmental factors contribute to addiction, should 
bring about changes in our approach to the prevention and treatment of addiction.

Long-term potentiation and long-term depression are processes that have been
widely studied to understand the molecular basis of information storage in the
brain. Glutamate receptors are required for the induction and expression of these
forms of plasticity, and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors are involved in
their modulation. Recent insights into how these receptors are rapidly moved into
and out of synaptic membranes has profound implications for our understanding of 
the mechanisms of long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

Both behaviour and its neural control can be studied at two levels. At the
proximate level, we aim to identify the neural circuits that control behaviour
and to understand how information is represented and processed in these circuits.
Ultimately, however, we are faced with questions of why particular neural
solutions have arisen, and what factors govern the ways in which neural circuits 
are modified during the evolution of new behaviours. Only by integrating these
levels of analysis can we fully understand the neural control of behaviour.
Recent studies of electrosensory systems show how this synthesis can benefit from
the use of tractable systems and comparative studies.

Changes in gene expression are required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity and 
long-term memory in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Regulation of local
protein synthesis allows synapses to control synaptic strength independently of
messenger RNA synthesis in the cell body. Recent reports indicate that several
biochemical signalling cascades couple neurotransmitter and neurotrophin
receptors to translational regulatory factors in protein synthesis-dependent
forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. In this review, we highlight these
translational regulatory mechanisms and the signalling pathways that govern the
expression of synaptic plasticity in response to specific types of neuronal
stimulation.

Stress has profound effects on brain structure and function, but the underlying
mechanisms are still poorly understood. Recent studies imply that neuronal cell
adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily--NCAM and L1--are important 
mediators of the effects of stress on the brain. Chronic stress regimes that lead
to hippocampal atrophy and spatial-learning impairment in rodents simultaneously 
induce a pattern of changes in cell adhesion molecule expression that fits with a
role for these molecules in stress-induced neuronal damage and neuroprotective
mechanisms. These findings highlight cell adhesion molecules as potential
therapeutic targets to treat stress-related cognitive disturbances.

Voltage-activated cation channels have pores that are selective for K(+), Na(+)
or Ca(2+). Neurons use these channels to generate and propagate action
potentials, release neurotransmitters at synaptic terminals and integrate
incoming signals in dendrites. Recent X-ray and electron microscopy studies of an
archaebacterial voltage-activated K(+) (Kv) channel have provided the first
atomic resolution images of the voltage-sensing domains in Kv channels. Although 
these structures are consistent with previous biophysical analyses of eukaryotic 
channels, they also contain surprises, which have provoked new ideas about the
structure and movements of these proteins during gating. This review summarizes
our current understanding of these intriguing membrane proteins and highlights
the open questions.

Objects are the building blocks of experience, but what do we mean by an object? 
Increasingly, neuroscientists refer to 'auditory objects', yet it is not clear
what properties these should possess, how they might be represented in the brain,
or how they might relate to the more familiar objects of vision. The concept of
an auditory object challenges our understanding of object perception. Here, we
offer a critical perspective on the concept and its basis in the brain.

During the last few decades, neuroscientists have benefited from the emergence of
many powerful functional imaging techniques that cover broad spatial and temporal
scales. We can now image single molecules controlling cell differentiation,
growth and death; single cells and their neurites processing electrical inputs
and sending outputs; neuronal circuits performing neural computations in vitro;
and the intact brain. At present, imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) 
offers the highest spatial and temporal resolution for imaging neocortical
functions in the living brain, and has paved the way for a new era in the
functional imaging of cortical dynamics. It has facilitated the exploration of
fundamental mechanisms that underlie neocortical development, function and
plasticity at the fundamental level of the cortical column.

There is increasing evidence that iron is involved in the mechanisms that
underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Conditions such as neuroferritinopathy 
and Friedreich ataxia are associated with mutations in genes that encode proteins
that are involved in iron metabolism, and as the brain ages, iron accumulates in 
regions that are affected by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. High
concentrations of reactive iron can increase oxidative-stress induced neuronal
vulnerability, and iron accumulation might increase the toxicity of environmental
or endogenous toxins. By studying the accumulation and cellular distribution of
iron during ageing, we should be able to increase our understanding of these
neurodegenerative disorders and develop new therapeutic strategies.

Priming is a nonconscious form of memory that involves a change in a person's
ability to identify, produce or classify an item as a result of a previous
encounter with that item or a related item. One important question relates to the
specificity of priming - the extent to which priming reflects the influence of
abstract representations or the retention of specific features of a previous
episode. Cognitive neuroscience analyses provide evidence for three types of
specificity: stimulus, associative and response. We consider empirical,
methodological and conceptual issues that relate to each type of specificity, and
suggest a theoretical perspective to help in guiding future research.

The learning and remembering of fearful events depends on the integrity of the
amygdala, but how are fear memories represented in the activity of amygdala
neurons? Here, we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that
neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition
and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies that combine unit
recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence
that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory. Extinction of fear
memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Understanding the signalling of aversive
memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems
that support fear behaviour.

Infants learn language with remarkable speed, but how they do it remains a
mystery. New data show that infants use computational strategies to detect the
statistical and prosodic patterns in language input, and that this leads to the
discovery of phonemes and words. Social interaction with another human being
affects speech learning in a way that resembles communicative learning in
songbirds. The brain's commitment to the statistical and prosodic patterns that
are experienced early in life might help to explain the long-standing puzzle of
why infants are better language learners than adults. Successful learning by
infants, as well as constraints on that learning, are changing theories of
language acquisition.

Recent technological advances, such as functional imaging techniques, allow
neuroscientists to measure and localize brain activity in healthy individuals.
These techniques avoid many of the limitations of the traditional method for
inferring brain function, which relies on examining patients with brain lesions. 
This has fueled the zeitgeist that the classical lesion method is an inferior and
perhaps obsolescent technique. However, although the lesion method has important 
weaknesses, we argue that it complements the newer activation methods (and their 
weaknesses). Furthermore, recent developments can address many of the criticisms 
of the lesion method. Patients with brain lesions provide a unique window into
brain function, and this approach will fill an important niche in future
research.

The roof plate is an embryonic organizing centre that occupies the dorsal midline
of the vertebrate neural tube. During early CNS development, the roof plate
produces secreted factors, which control the specification and differentiation of
dorsal neuronal cell types. An appreciation of the signalling properties of the
roof plate has prompted an enhanced interest in this important organizing centre,
and several recent studies have begun to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of
roof plate development.

Mammals adapt to a rapidly changing world because of the sophisticated cognitive 
functions that are supported by the neocortex. The neocortex, which forms almost 
80% of the human brain, seems to have arisen from repeated duplication of a
stereotypical microcircuit template with subtle specializations for different
brain regions and species. The quest to unravel the blueprint of this template
started more than a century ago and has revealed an immensely intricate design.
The largest obstacle is the daunting variety of inhibitory interneurons that are 
found in the circuit. This review focuses on the organizing principles that
govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits.

Primary brain tumours are among the most lethal of all cancers, largely as a
result of their lack of responsiveness to current therapy. Numerous new therapies
hold great promise for the treatment of patients with brain cancer, but the main 
challenge is to determine which treatment is most likely to benefit an individual
patient. DNA-microarray-based technologies, which allow simultaneous analysis of 
expression of thousands of genes, have already begun to uncover previously
unrecognized patient subsets that differ in their survival. Here, we review the
progress made so far in using DNA microarrays to optimize brain cancer therapy.

PDZ domains are protein-interaction domains that are often found in multi-domain 
scaffolding proteins. PDZ-containing scaffolds assemble specific proteins into
large molecular complexes at defined locations in the cell. In the postsynaptic
density of neuronal excitatory synapses, PDZ proteins such as PSD-95 organize
glutamate receptors and their associated signalling proteins and determine the
size and strength of synapses. PDZ scaffolds also function in the dynamic
trafficking of synaptic proteins by assembling cargo complexes for transport by
molecular motors. As key organizers that control synaptic protein composition and
structure, PDZ scaffolds are themselves highly regulated by synthesis and
degradation, subcellular distribution and post-translational modification.

Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) channels of small (SK) and intermediate (IK)
conductance are present in a wide range of excitable and non-excitable cells. On 
activation by low concentrations of Ca(2+), they open, which results in
hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and changes in cellular excitability.
K(Ca)-channel activation also counteracts further increases in intracellular
Ca(2+), thereby regulating the concentration of this ubiquitous intracellular
messenger in space and time. K(Ca) channels have various functions, including the
regulation of neuronal firing properties, blood flow and cell proliferation. The 
cloning of SK and IK channels has prompted investigations into their gating,
pharmacology and organization into calcium-signalling domains, and has provided a
framework that can be used to correlate molecularly identified K(Ca) channels
with their native currents.

Our eyes send different 'images' of the outside world to the brain - an image of 
contours (line drawing), a colour image (watercolour painting) or an image of
moving objects (movie). This is commonly referred to as parallel processing, and 
starts as early as the first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle. Here, the
molecular composition of the transmitter receptors of the postsynaptic neurons
defines which images are transferred to the inner retina. Within the second
synaptic layer - the inner plexiform layer - circuits that involve complex
inhibitory and excitatory interactions represent filters that select 'what the
eye tells the brain'.

A fundamental question in visual perception is whether the representation of the 
fovea is split at the midline between the two hemispheres, or bilaterally
represented by overlapping projections of the fovea in each hemisphere. Here we
examine psychophysical, anatomical, neuropsychological and brain stimulation
experiments that have addressed this question, and argue for a shift from the
current default view of bilateral representation to that of a split
representation, to provide a greater understanding of higher visual processes.

Developmental deficits that affect speech perception increase the risk of
language and literacy problems, which can lead to lowered academic and
occupational accomplishment. Normal development and disorders of speech
perception have both been linked to temporospectral auditory processing speed.
Understanding the role of dynamic auditory processing in speech perception and
language comprehension has led to the development of neuroplasticity-based
intervention strategies aimed at ameliorating language and literacy problems and 
their sequelae.

In birds and mammals, differences in development between the sexes arise from the
differential actions of genes that are encoded on the sex chromosomes. These
genes are differentially represented in the cells of males and females, and have 
been selected for sex-specific roles. The brain is a sexually dimorphic organ and
is also shaped by sex-specific selection pressures. Genes on the sex chromosomes 
probably determine the gender (sexually dimorphic phenotype) of the brain in two 
ways: by acting on the gonads to induce sex differences in levels of gonadal
secretions that have sex-specific effects on the brain, and by acting in the
brain itself to differentiate XX and XY brain cells.

Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02129, USA.

Developing neurons are programmed to die by an apoptotic pathway unless they are 
rescued by extrinsic growth factors that generate an anti-apoptotic response. By 
contrast, adult neurons need to survive for the lifetime of the organism, and
their premature death can cause irreversible functional deficits. The default
apoptotic pathway is shut down when development is complete, and consequently
growth factors are no longer required to prevent death. To protect against
accidental apoptotic cell death, anti-apoptotic mechanisms are activated in
mature neurons in response to stress. Loss or reduced activity of these intrinsic
anti-apoptotic 'brakes' might contribute to or accelerate neurodegeneration,
whereas their activation might rescue neurons from injury or genetic
abnormalities.

Treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the biggest unmet medical need in neurology.
Current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying
effects. Three main classes of disease-modification approaches can be defined:
one that is broadly neurotrophic or neuroprotective, one that targets specific
aspects of AD pathology, and one that is based on epidemiological observation.
This review discusses all three approaches, with particular emphasis on
anti-amyloid strategies - currently the most active area of investigation. The
approaches that are reviewed include secretase inhibition, amyloid-beta
aggregation inhibition, immunotherapy and strategies that might indirectly affect
the amyloid pathway.

Carbohydrate-carrying molecules in the nervous system have important roles during
development, regeneration and synaptic plasticity. Carbohydrates mediate
interactions between recognition molecules, thereby contributing to the formation
of a complex molecular meshwork at the cell surface and in the extracellular
matrix. The tremendous structural diversity of glycan chains allows for immense
combinatorial possibilities that might underlie the fine-tuning of cell-cell and 
cell-matrix interactions.

Neuroscientists associate the name of Donald O. Hebb with the Hebbian synapse and
the Hebbian learning rule, which underlie connectionist theories and synaptic
plasticity, but Hebb's work has also influenced developmental psychology,
neuropsychology, perception and the study of emotions, as well as learning and
memory. Here, we review the work of Hebb and its lasting influence on
neuroscience in honour of the 2004 centenary of his birth.

The molecular basis of water transport in the brain.

Brain function is inextricably coupled to water homeostasis. The fact that most
of the volume between neurons is occupied by glial cells, leaving only a narrow
extracellular space, represents an important challenge, as even small
extracellular volume changes will affect ion concentrations and therefore
neuronal excitability. Further, the ionic transmembrane shifts that are required 
to maintain ion homeostasis during neuronal activity must be accompanied by
water. It follows that the mechanisms for water transport across plasma membranes
must have a central part in brain physiology. These mechanisms are also likely to
be of pathophysiological importance in brain oedema, which represents a net
accumulation of water in brain tissue. Recent studies have shed light on the
molecular basis for brain water transport and have identified a class of
specialized water channels in the brain that might be crucial to the
physiological and pathophysiological handling of water.

Proteinase-activated receptors in the nervous system.

Recent data point to important roles for proteinases and their cognate
proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) in the ontogeny and pathophysiology of the 
nervous system. PARs are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that can affect 
neural cell proliferation, morphology and physiology. PARs also have important
roles in neuroinflammatory and degenerative diseases such as human
immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia, Alzheimer's disease and pain. These
receptors might also influence the pathogenesis of stroke and multiple sclerosis,
conditions in which the blood-brain barrier is disrupted. The diversity of
effects of PARs on neural function and their widespread distribution in the
nervous system make them attractive therapeutic targets for neurological
disorders. Here, we review the roles of PARs in the central and peripheral
nervous systems during health and disease, with a focus on neuroinflammatory and 
degenerative disorders.

The local differentiation of myelinated axons at nodes of Ranvier.

Author information:

Rehovot, Israel.

Efficient and rapid propagation of action potentials in myelinated axons depends 
on the molecular specialization of the nodes of Ranvier. The nodal region is
organized into several distinct domains, each of which contains a unique set of
ion channels, cell-adhesion molecules and cytoplasmic adaptor proteins.
Voltage-gated Na+ channels - which are concentrated at the nodes - are separated 
from K+ channels - which are clustered at the juxtaparanodal region - by a
specialized axoglial contact that is formed between the axon and the myelinating 
cell at the paranodes. This local differentiation of myelinated axons is tightly 
regulated by oligodendrocytes and myelinating Schwann cells, and is achieved
through complex mechanisms that are used by another specialized cell-cell contact
- the synapse.

Several families of extracellular guidance cues have been implicated in guiding
neurons and axons to their appropriate destinations in the nervous system. Their 
receptors include single- and seven-transmembrane receptors, and their signal
transduction pathways converge onto the Rho family of small GTPases, which
control the cytoskeleton. A single guidance protein can use different mechanisms 
to regulate different kinds of motility or the motilities of different cell
types. There is crosstalk between the signalling pathways initiated by distinct
guidance cues. Studies of neuronal guidance mechanisms have shed light not only
on neural development, but also on other processes that involve the extracellular
regulation of the cytoskeleton.

New genetic models that target the serotonin system show that transient
alterations in serotonin homeostasis cause permanent changes to adult behaviour
and modify the fine wiring of brain connections. These findings have revived a
long-standing interest in the developmental role of serotonin. Molecular genetic 
approaches are now showing us that different serotonin receptors, acting at
different developmental stages, modulate different developmental processes such
as neurogenesis, apoptosis, axon branching and dendritogenesis. Our understanding
of the specification of the serotonergic phenotype is improving. In addition,
studies have revealed that serotonergic traits are dissociable, as there are
populations of neurons that contain serotonin but do not synthesize it.

Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels have a wide range of functions including 
the control of neuronal signalling, heart rate, blood flow and insulin release.
Because of the physiological importance of these channels, considerable effort
has been invested in understanding the structural basis of their physiology. In
this review, we use two recent, high-resolution structures as foundations for
examining our current understanding of the fundamental functions that are shared 
by all K(+) channels, such as K(+) selectivity and channel gating, as well as
characteristic features of Kir channel family members, such as inward
rectification and their regulation by intracellular factors.

According to the 'mental time travel hypothesis' animals, unlike humans, cannot
mentally travel backwards in time to recollect specific past events (episodic
memory) or forwards to anticipate future needs (future planning). Until recently,
there was little evidence in animals for either ability. Experiments on memory in
food-caching birds, however, question this assumption by showing that western
scrub-jays form integrated, flexible, trial-unique memories of what they hid,
where and when. Moreover, these birds can adjust their caching behaviour in
anticipation of future needs. We suggest that some animals have elements of both 
episodic-like memory and future planning.

Although integration is a widely acknowledged goal in neuroscience, our approach 
to the function of biological entities often places boundaries that defy
integration. Mapping across systems - from the genome to cognitive function -
will require innovative methods that can identify every contributing component to
a function, and instantaneously scale numerous changes in large data sets to
consequences over the entire biological hierarchy.

The malleability of memory is becoming increasingly clear. Many influences can
cause memories to change or even be created anew, including our imaginations and 
the leading questions or different recollections of others. The knowledge that we
cannot rely on our memories, however compelling they might be, leads to questions
about the validity of criminal convictions that are based largely on the
testimony of victims or witnesses. Our scientific understanding of memory should 
be used to help the legal system to navigate this minefield.

Primary visual cortex and visual awareness.

The primary visual cortex (V1) is probably the best characterized area of primate
cortex, but whether this region contributes directly to conscious visual
experience is controversial. Early neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies
found that visual awareness was best correlated with neural activity in
extrastriate visual areas, but recent studies have found similarly powerful
effects in V1. Lesion and inactivation studies have provided further evidence
that V1 might be necessary for conscious perception. Whereas hierarchical models 
propose that damage to V1 simply disrupts the flow of information to extrastriate
areas that are crucial for awareness, interactive models propose that recurrent
connections between V1 and higher areas form functional circuits that support
awareness. Further investigation into V1 and its interactions with higher areas
might uncover fundamental aspects of the neural basis of visual awareness.

Recent studies combining psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments in
behaving monkeys have provided new insights into how several cortical areas
integrate efforts to solve a vibrotactile discrimination task. In particular,
these studies have addressed how neural codes are related to perception, working 
memory and decision making in this model. The primary somatosensory cortex drives
higher cortical areas where past and current sensory information are combined,
such that a comparison of the two evolves into a behavioural decision. These and 
other observations in visual tasks indicate that decisions emerge from
highly-distributed processes in which the details of a scheduled motor plan are
gradually specified by sensory information.

The ability to detect and respond to novel events is crucial for survival in a
rapidly changing environment. Four decades of neuroscientific research has begun 
to delineate the neural mechanisms by which the brain detects and responds to
novelty. Here, we review this research and suggest how changes in neural
processing at the cellular, synaptic and network levels allow us to detect,
attend to and subsequently remember the occurrence of a novel event.

The visual recognition of complex movements and actions is crucial for the
survival of many species. It is important not only for communication and
recognition at a distance, but also for the learning of complex motor actions by 
imitation. Movement recognition has been studied in psychophysical,
neurophysiological and imaging experiments, and several cortical areas involved
in it have been identified. We use a neurophysiologically plausible and
quantitative model as a tool for organizing and making sense of the experimental 
data, despite their growing size and complexity. We review the main experimental 
findings and discuss possible neural mechanisms, and show that a learning-based, 
feedforward model provides a neurophysiologically plausible and consistent
summary of many key experimental results.

We are an intensely social species--it has been argued that our social nature
defines what makes us human, what makes us conscious or what gave us our large
brains. As a new field, the social brain sciences are probing the neural
underpinnings of social behaviour and have produced a banquet of data that are
both tantalizing and deeply puzzling. We are finding new links between emotion
and reason, between action and perception, and between representations of other
people and ourselves. No less important are the links that are also being
established across disciplines to understand social behaviour, as
neuroscientists, social psychologists, anthropologists, ethologists and
philosophers forge new collaborations.

Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous
system, but many studies have expanded its functional repertoire by showing that 
glutamate receptors are present in a variety of non-excitable cells. How does
glutamate receptor activation modulate their activity? Do non-excitable cells
release glutamate, and, if so, how? These questions remain enigmatic. Here, we
review the current knowledge on glutamatergic signalling in non-neuronal cells,
with a special emphasis on astrocytes.

A computational perspective on the neural basis of multisensory spatial

We argue that current theories of multisensory representations are inconsistent
with the existence of a large proportion of multimodal neurons with gain fields
and partially shifting receptive fields. Moreover, these theories do not fully
resolve the recoding and statistical issues involved in multisensory integration.
An alternative theory, which we have recently developed and review here, has
important implications for the idea of 'frame of reference' in neural spatial
representations. This theory is based on a neural architecture that combines
basis functions and attractor dynamics. Basis function units are used to solve
the recoding problem, whereas attractor dynamics are used for optimal statistical
inferences. This architecture accounts for gain fields and partially shifting
receptive fields, which emerge naturally as a result of the network connectivity 
and dynamics.

In the immature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is excitatory, and
GABA-releasing synapses are formed before glutamatergic contacts in a wide range 
of species and structures. GABA becomes inhibitory by the delayed expression of a
chloride exporter, leading to a negative shift in the reversal potential for
choride ions. I propose that this mechanism provides a solution to the problem of
how to excite developing neurons to promote growth and synapse formation while
avoiding the potentially toxic effects of a mismatch between GABA-mediated
inhibition and glutamatergic excitation. As key elements of this cascade are
activity dependent, the formation of inhibition adds an element of nurture to the
construction of cortical networks.

Is there more to GABA than synaptic inhibition?

In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during
nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, 
differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes
by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and
probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional
properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly
different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The
unique features of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to
explain how GABA acts as a developmental signal.

Multiple sclerosis is a common cause of neurological disability in young adults. 
The disease is complex -- its aetiology is multifactorial and largely unknown;
its pathology is heterogeneous; and, clinically, it is difficult to diagnose,
manage and treat. However, perhaps its most frustrating aspect is the inadequacy 
of the healing response of remyelination. This regenerative process generally
occurs with great efficiency in experimental models, and sometimes proceeds to
completion in multiple sclerosis. But as the disease progresses, the numbers of
lesions in which demyelination persists increases, significantly contributing to 
clinical deterioration. Understanding why remyelination fails is crucial for
devising effective methods by which to enhance it.

Breaking the neuronal sphere: regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in

The sprouting of neurites, which will later become axons and dendrites, is an
important event in early neuronal differentiation. Studies in living neurons
indicate that neuritogenesis begins immediately after neuronal commitment, with
the activation of membrane receptors by extracellular cues. These receptors
activate intracellular cascades that trigger changes in the actin cytoskeleton,
which promote the initial breakdown of symmetry. Then, through the regulation of 
gene transcription, and of microtubule and membrane dynamics, the newly formed
neurite becomes stabilized. A key challenge is to define the molecular machinery 
that regulates the actin cytoskeleton during initial neurite sprouting. We
propose that analysing the molecules involved in actin-dependent mechanisms in
non-neuronal systems, such as budding yeast and migrating fibroblasts, could help
to uncover the secrets of neuritogenesis.

Sleep can be addressed across the entire hierarchy of biological organization. We
discuss neuronal-network and regional forebrain activity during sleep, and its
consequences for consciousness and cognition. Complex interactions in
thalamocortical circuits maintain the electroencephalographic oscillations of
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Functional neuroimaging affords views of the
human brain in both NREM and REM sleep, and has informed new concepts of the
neural basis of dreaming during REM sleep -- a state that is characterized by
illogic, hallucinosis and emotionality compared with waking. Replay of waking
neuronal activity during sleep in the rodent hippocampus and in functional images
of human brains indicates possible roles for sleep in neuroplasticity. Different 
forms and stages of learning and memory might benefit from different stages of
sleep and be subserved by different forebrain regions.

How do you feel? Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the
body.

Craig AD.

As humans, we perceive feelings from our bodies that relate our state of
well-being, our energy and stress levels, our mood and disposition. How do we
have these feelings? What neural processes do they represent? Recent functional
anatomical work has detailed an afferent neural system in primates and in humans 
that represents all aspects of the physiological condition of the physical body. 
This system constitutes a representation of 'the material me', and might provide 
a foundation for subjective feelings, emotion and self-awareness.

Animal models of neurological deficits are essential for the assessment of new
therapeutic options. It has been suggested that rats are not as appropriate as
primates for the symptomatic modelling of disease, but a large body of data
argues against this view. Comparative analyses of movements in rats and primates 
show homology of many motor patterns across species. Advances have been made in
identifying rat equivalents of akinesia, tremor, postural deficits and
dyskinesia, which are relevant to Parkinson's disease. Rat models of hemiplegia, 
neglect and tactile extinction are useful in assessing the outcome of ischaemic
or traumatic brain injury, and in monitoring the effects of therapeutic
interventions. Studies in rodents that emphasize careful behavioural analysis
should continue to be developed as effective and inexpensive models that
complement studies in primates.

The amygdala -- an almond-shaped group of nuclei at the heart of the
telencephalon -- has been associated with a range of cognitive functions,
including emotion, learning, memory, attention and perception. Most current views
of amygdala function emphasize its role in negative emotions, such as fear, and
in linking negative emotions with other aspects of cognition, such as learning
and memory. However, recent evidence supports a role for the amygdala in
processing positive emotions as well as negative ones, including learning about
the beneficial biological value of stimuli. Indeed, the amygdala's role in
stimulus-reward learning might be just as important as its role in processing

Orchestrating a movement towards a sensory target requires many computational
processes, including a transformation between reference frames. This
transformation is important because the reference frames in which sensory stimuli
are encoded often differ from those of motor effectors. The posterior parietal
cortex has an important role in these transformations. Recent work indicates that
a significant proportion of parietal neurons in two cortical areas transforms the
sensory signals that are used to guide movements into a common reference frame.
This common reference frame is an eye-centred representation that is modulated by
eye-, head-, body- or limb-position signals. A common reference frame might
facilitate communication between different areas that are involved in
coordinating the movements of different effectors. It might also be an efficient 
way to represent the locations of different sensory targets in the world.

The navigational strategies that are used by foraging ants and bees to reach a
goal are similar to those of birds and mammals. Species from all these groups use
path integration and memories of visual landmarks to navigate through familiar
terrain. Insects have far fewer neural resources than vertebrates, so data from
insects might be useful in revealing the essential components of efficient
navigation. Recent work on ants and bees has uncovered a major role for
associative links between long-term memories. We emphasize the roles of these
associations in the reliable recognition of visual landmarks and the reliable
performance of learnt routes. It is unknown whether such associations also
provide insects with a map-like representation of familiar terrain. We suggest,
however, that landmarks act primarily as signposts that tell insects what
particular action they need to perform, rather than telling them where they are.

The specification of neurotransmitter phenotype is an important aspect of
neuronal fate determination. Substantial progress has been made in uncovering key
extracellular signals and transcriptional regulators that control the mode of
neurotransmission in several model systems, among which catecholaminergic and
serotonergic neurons feature prominently. Here, we review our current knowledge
of the regulatory circuits that direct neurotransmitter choice, and discuss the
development of well-studied types of catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons. 
One emerging concept is that different types of neuron use a similar core
programme to control shared modes of neurotransmission, but recruit different
factors that are specific for each neuronal type. Another is that most factors
that specify neurotransmitter identity also control other features of the
neuronal phenotype.

Certain morphological, physiological and molecular characteristics are shared by 
all neurons. However, despite these similarities, neurons constitute the most
diverse cell population of any organism. Recently, considerable attention has
been focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie this cellular 
diversity. Parallel studies in Drosophila and vertebrates have revealed that
proneural genes are key regulators of neurogenesis, coordinating the acquisition 
of a generic neuronal fate and of specific subtype identities that are
appropriate for the location and time of neuronal generation. These studies
reveal that, in spite of differences between invertebrate and vertebrate neural
lineages, Drosophila and vertebrate proneural genes have remarkably similar
roles.

Synapses are not static; their performance is modified adaptively in response to 
activity. Presynaptic mechanisms that affect the probability of transmitter
release or the amount of transmitter that is released are important in synaptic
diversification. Here, we address the diversity of presynaptic performance and
its underlying mechanisms: how much of the variation can be accounted for by
variation in synaptic morphology and how much by molecular differences?
Significant progress has been made in defining presynaptic structural
contributions to synaptic strength; by contrast, we know little about how
presynaptic proteins produce normally observed functional differentiation,
despite abundant information on presynaptic proteins and on the effects of their 
individual manipulation. Closing the gap between molecular and physiological
synaptic diversification still represents a considerable challenge.

Complex traits, including many disease-related traits, are influenced by multiple

to multivariate methods to synthesize the effects of multiple genes, integrate
results across independent studies, and aid in the identification of coordinated 
pathways and interactions between loci.

Studies of experience-driven neuroplasticity at the behavioural, ensemble,
cellular and molecular levels have shown that the structure and significance of
the eliciting stimulus can determine the neural changes that result. Studying
such effects in humans is difficult, but professional musicians represent an
ideal model in which to investigate plastic changes in the human brain. There are
two advantages to studying plasticity in musicians: the complexity of the
eliciting stimulus music and the extent of their exposure to this stimulus. Here,
we focus on the functional and anatomical differences that have been detected in 
musicians by modern neuroimaging methods.

What is the nature of our ability to understand and reason about the beliefs of
others--the possession of a "theory of mind", or ToM? Here, we review findings
from imaging and lesion studies indicating that ToM reasoning is supported by a
widely distributed neural system. Some functional components of this system, such
as language-related regions of the left hemisphere, the frontal lobes and the
right temporal parietal cortex, are not solely dedicated to the computation of
mental states. However, the system also includes a core, domain-specific
component that is centred on the amygdala circuitry. We provide a framework in
which impairments of ToM can be viewed in terms of abnormalities of the core
system, the failure of a co-opted system that is necessary for performance on a
particular set of tasks, or the absence of an experiential trigger for the
emergence of ToM.

Stress is a biologically significant factor that, by altering brain cell
properties, can disturb cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and
consequently limit the quality of human life. Extensive rodent and human research
has shown that the hippocampus is not only crucially involved in memory
formation, but is also highly sensitive to stress. So, the study of
stress-induced cognitive and neurobiological sequelae in animal models might
provide valuable insight into the mnemonic mechanisms that are vulnerable to
stress. Here, we provide an overview of the neurobiology of stress memory
interactions, and present a neural endocrine model to explain how stress modifies
hippocampal functioning.

Animal studies have shown that sensory deprivation in one modality can have
striking effects on the development of the remaining modalities. Although recent 
studies of deaf and blind humans have also provided convincing behavioural,
electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence of increased capabilities and
altered organization of spared modalities, there is still much debate about the
identity of the brain systems that are changed and the mechanisms that mediate
these changes. Plastic changes across brain systems and related behaviours vary
as a function of the timing and the nature of changes in experience. This
specificity must be understood in the context of differences in the maturation
rates and timing of the associated critical periods, differences in patterns of
transiently existing connections, and differences in molecular factors across
brain systems.

In addition to its role as a sex hormone, oestrogen affects the structure and
function of the nervous system. Oestrogen receptors are expressed in brain
regions that are involved in sex differentiation and maturation. But in addition 
to its well-known effects, oestrogen also has important neuroprotective actions
that are both dependent and independent of a nuclear oestrogen-receptor activity.
Furthermore, oestrogen can interact with neuroprotective intracellular signalling
pathways and is itself a neuroprotective antioxidant. Understanding the
mechanisms of oestrogen action will be crucial to determine its potential as a
therapeutic agent, particularly in the elderly.

The conventional scheme of cortical formation shows that postmitotic neurons
migrate away from the germinal ventricular zone to their positions in the
developing cortex, guided by the processes of radial glial cells. However, recent
studies indicate that different neuronal types adopt distinct modes of migration 
in the developing cortex. Here, we review evidence for two modes of radial
movement: somal translocation, which is adopted by the early-generated neurons;
and glia-guided locomotion, which is used predominantly by pyramidal cells.
Cortical interneurons, which originate in the ventral telencephalon, use a third 
mode of migration. They migrate tangentially into the cortex, then seek the
ventricular zone before moving radially to take up their positions in the
cortical anlage.

There is a pressing need for treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Hopes
have been raised by the prospect of neural stem cell therapy; however, despite
intense research activities and media attention, stem cell therapy for
neurological disorders is still a distant goal. Effective strategies must be
developed to isolate, enrich and propagate homogeneous populations of neural stem
cells, and to identify the molecules and mechanisms that are required for their
proper integration into the injured brain. This article examines these
requirements, discusses the results obtained so far, and considers the steps that
need to be taken to provide instruction to donor cells and to elucidate the
neurogenic potential of the adult central nervous system environment.

For more than 1,500 years, nerves were thought to function through the action of 
'animal spirits'. In the seventeenth century, René Descartes conceived of these
'spirits' as liquids or gases, and used the idea to explain reflex action. But he
was rapidly proven wrong by a young Dutchman, Jan Swammerdam. Swammerdam's
elegant experiments pioneered the frog nerve muscle preparation and laid the
foundation of our modern understanding of nerve function.

Members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) families comprising neurotrophins and GDNF-family ligands (GFLs),
respectively are crucial for the development and maintenance of distinct sets of 
central and peripheral neurons. Knockout studies in the mouse have revealed that 
members of these two families might collaborate or act sequentially in a given
neuron. Although neurotrophins and GFLs activate common intracellular signalling 
pathways through their receptor tyrosine kinases, several clear differences exist
between these families of trophic factors.

Childhood absence epilepsy is an idiopathic, generalized non-convulsive epilepsy 
with a multifactorial genetic aetiology. Molecular-genetic analyses of affected
human families and experimental models, together with neurobiological
investigations, have led to important breakthroughs in the identification of
candidate genes and loci, and potential pathophysiological mechanisms for this
type of epilepsy. Here, we review these results, and compare the human and
experimental phenotypes that have been investigated. Continuing efforts and
comparisons of this type will help us to elucidate the multigenetic traits and
pathophysiology of this form of generalized epilepsy.

A key goal in neuroscience is to explain how the operations of a neuron emerge
from sets of active channels with specific dendritic distributions. If general
principles can be identified for these distributions, dendritic channels should
reflect the computational role of a given cell type within its functional neural 
circuit. Here, we discuss insights from experimental and computational data on
the distribution of voltage-gated channels in dendrites, and attempt to derive
rules for how their interactions implement different dendritic functions. We
propose that this type of analysis will be important for understanding
behavioural processes in terms of single-neuron properties, and that it
constitutes a step towards a 'functional proteomics' of nerve cells, which will
be essential for defining neuronal phenotypes.

Locomotion in vertebrates and invertebrates has a long history in research as the
most prominent example of interlimb coordination. However, the evolution towards 
upright stance and gait has paved the way for a bewildering variety of functions 
in which the upper limbs interact with each other in a context-specific manner.
The neural basis of these bimanual interactions has been investigated in recent
years on different scales, ranging from the single-cell level to the analysis of 
neuronal assemblies. Although the prevailing viewpoint has been to assign
bimanual coordination to a single brain locus, more recent evidence points to a
distributed network that governs the processes of neural synchronization and
desynchronization that underlie the rich variety of coordinated functions. The
distributed nature of this network accounts for disruptions of interlimb
coordination across various movement disorders.

Over a short period in the late 1990s, three groups converged on the discovery of
a neuropeptide system, centred in the dorsolateral hypothalamus, that regulates
arousal states, influences feeding and is implicated in the sleep disorder
narcolepsy. Subsequent studies have illuminated many aspects of the circuitry of 
the hypocretin (also called orexin) system, which also influences hormone
secretion and autonomic homeostasis, and have led to the hypothesis that most
human narcolepsies result from an autoimmune attack against the
hypocretin-producing neurons. The biochemical, physiological and anatomical
components that regulate the switch between waking and sleeping are becoming
clear. The rapidity with which the hypocretin story has emerged is a testament to
both the conceptual and the technical evolution of genomic science in the past
two decades.

Functional imaging gives us increasingly detailed information about the location

meaning of location data. Here, we review methods for reporting location in
functional imaging and discuss the problems that arise from the great variability
in brain anatomy between individuals. These problems cause uncertainty in
localization, which limits the effective resolution of functional imaging,
especially for brain areas involved in higher cognitive function.

Human neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of
specific neuronal populations, resulting in substantial disability and early
death. The identification of causative single-gene mutations in families with
inherited neurodegenerative disorders has facilitated the modelling of these
diseases in experimental organisms, including the fruitfly Drosophila
melanogaster. Many neurodegenerative diseases have now been successfully modelled
in Drosophila, and genetic analysis is under way in each of these models. Using
fruitfly genetics to define the molecular pathways that underlie the
neurodegenerative process is likely to improve substantially our understanding of

Recent discoveries about how the central nervous system responds to injury and
how patients reacquire lost behaviours by training have yielded promising new
therapies for neurorehabilitation. Until recently, this field had been largely
static, but the current melding of basic behavioural science with neuroscience
promises entirely new approaches to improving behavioural, perceptual and
cognitive capabilities after neurological damage. Studies of phenomena such as
cortical reorganization after a lesion, central nervous system repair, and the
substantial enhancement of extremity use and linguistic function by behavioural
therapy, support this emerging view. The ongoing changes in rehabilitation
strategies might well amount to an impending paradigm shift in this field.

Innate immunity: the missing link in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration?

Hospital Research Institute, Montréal, Québec, H3G 1A4, Canada.

Innate immunity was previously thought to be a nonspecific immunological
programme that was engaged by peripheral organs to maintain homeostasis after
stress and injury. Emerging evidence indicates that this highly organized
response also takes place in the central nervous system. Through the recognition 
of neuronal fingerprints, the long-term induction of the innate immune response
and its transition to an adaptive form might be central to the pathophysiology
and aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Paradoxically, this response also
protects neurons by favouring remyelination and trophic support afforded by glial
cells.

Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.

We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry
out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts of the
intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and
applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This
system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which
includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely
lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection.
Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant
stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral
frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system,
directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during
normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.

Reviews on the visual system generally praise its amazing performance. Here we
deal with its biggest weakness: sluggishness. Inherent delays lead to
mislocalization when things move or, more generally, when things change. Errors
in time translate into spatial errors when we pursue a moving object, when we try
to localize a target that appears just before a gaze shift, or when we compare
the position of a flashed target with the instantaneous position of a
continuously moving one (or one that appears to be moving even though no change
occurs in the retinal image). Studying such diverse errors might rekindle our
thinking about how the brain copes with real-time changes in the world.

The molecular basis of CaMKII function in synaptic and behavioural memory.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454, USA.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus has been the
primary model by which to study the cellular and molecular basis of memory.
Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is necessary for LTP
induction, is persistently activated by stimuli that elicit LTP, and can, by
itself, enhance the efficacy of synaptic transmission. The analysis of CaMKII
autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation indicates that this kinase could serve 
as a molecular switch that is capable of long-term memory storage. Consistent
with such a role, mutations that prevent persistent activation of CaMKII block
LTP, experience-dependent plasticity and behavioural memory. These results make
CaMKII a leading candidate in the search for the molecular basis of memory.

What does fMRI tell us about neuronal activity?

In recent years, cognitive neuroscientists have taken great advantage of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a non-invasive method of
measuring neuronal activity in the human brain. But what exactly does fMRI tell
us? We know that its signals arise from changes in local haemodynamics that, in
turn, result from alterations in neuronal activity, but exactly how neuronal
activity, haemodynamics and fMRI signals are related is unclear. It has been
assumed that the fMRI signal is proportional to the local average neuronal
activity, but many factors can influence the relationship between the two. A
clearer understanding of how neuronal activity influences the fMRI signal is
needed if we are correctly to interpret functional imaging data.

In this article, I discuss the use of neurally driven evolutionary autonomous
agents (EAAs) in neuroscientific investigations. Two fundamental questions are
addressed. Can EAA studies shed new light on the structure and function of
biological nervous systems? And can these studies lead to the development of new 
tools for neuroscientific analysis? The value and significant potential of EAA
modelling in both respects is demonstrated and discussed. Although the study of
EAAs for neuroscience research still faces difficult conceptual and technical
challenges, it is a promising and timely endeavour.

Erratum in
    Nat Rev Neurosci 2002 Mar;3(3):236.

Recent evidence from cerebellum-dependent motor learning and amygdala-dependent
fear conditioning indicates that, despite being mediated by different brain
systems, these forms of learning might use a similar sequence of events to form
new memories. In each case, learning seems to induce changes in two different
groups of neurons. Changes in the first class of cells are induced very rapidly
during the initial stages of learning, whereas changes in the second class of
cells develop more slowly and are resistant to extinction. So, anatomically
distinct cell populations might contribute differentially to the initial encoding
and the long-term storage of memory in these two systems.

Potassium channel structures.

Author information:

The molecular basis of K+ channel function is universally conserved. K+ channels 
allow K+ flux and are essential for the generation of electric current across
excitable membranes. K+ channels are also the targets of various intracellular
control mechanisms, such that the suboptimal regulation of channel function might
be related to pathological conditions. Because of the fundamental role of K+
channels in controlling membrane excitability, a structural understanding of
their function and regulation will provide a useful framework for understanding
neuronal physiology. Many recent physiological and crystallographic studies have 
led to new insights into the workings of K+ channels.

The conversion of acetylcholine binding into ion conduction across the membrane
is becoming more clearly understood in terms of the structure of the receptor and
its transitions. A high-resolution structure of a protein that is homologous to
the extracellular domain of the receptor has revealed the binding sites and
subunit interfaces in great detail. Although the structures of the membrane and
cytoplasmic domains are less well determined, the channel lining and the
determinants of selectivity have been mapped. The location and structure of the
gates, and the coupling between binding sites and gates, remain to be
established.

As in the case of many ligand-gated ion channels, the biochemical and
electrophysiological properties of the ionotropic glutamate receptors have been
studied extensively. Nevertheless, we still do not understand the molecular
mechanisms that harness the free energy of agonist binding, first to drive
channel opening, and then to allow the channel to close (desensitize) even though
agonist remains bound. Recent crystallographic analyses of the ligand-binding
domains of these receptors have identified conformational changes associated with
agonist binding, yielding a working hypothesis of channel function. This opens
the way to determining how the domains and subunits are assembled into an
oligomeric channel, how the domains are connected, how the channel is formed, and
where it is located relative to the ligand-binding domains, all of which govern
the processes of channel activation and desensitization.

Synapses show widely varying degrees of short-term facilitation and depression.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie short-term plasticity, but the 
contributions of presynaptic mechanisms have been particularly difficult to study
because of the small size of synaptic boutons in the mammalian brain. Here we
review the functional properties of the calyx of Held, a giant nerve terminal
that has shed new light on the general mechanisms that control short-term
plasticity. The calyx of Held has also provided fresh insights into the
strategies used by synapses to extend their dynamic range of operation and
preserve the timing of sensory stimuli.

Anomalous perception in synaesthesia: a cognitive neuroscience perspective.

Author information:

Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.

An enduring question in cognitive neuroscience is how the physical properties of 
the world are represented in the brain to yield conscious perception. In most
people, a particular physical stimulus gives rise to a unitary, unimodal
perceptual experience. So, light energy leads to the sensation of seeing, whereas
sound waves produce the experience of hearing. However, for individuals with the 
rare phenomenon of synaesthesia, specific physical stimuli consistently induce
more than one perceptual experience. For example, hearing particular sounds might
induce vivid experiences of colour, taste or odour, as might the sight of visual 
symbols, such as letters or digits. Here we review the latest findings on
synaesthesia, and consider its possible genetic, neural and cognitive bases. We
also propose a neurocognitive framework for understanding such anomalous
perceptual experiences.

The development of ocular dominance columns has served as a Rosetta stone for
understanding the mechanisms that guide the construction of cortical circuits.
Traditionally, the emergence of ocular dominance columns was thought to be
closely tied to the critical period, during which columnar architecture is highly
susceptible to alterations in visual input. However, recent findings in cats,
monkeys and ferrets indicate that columns develop far earlier, more rapidly and
with considerably greater precision than was previously suspected. These
observations indicate that the initial establishment of cortical functional
architecture, and its subsequent plasticity during the critical period, are
distinct developmental phases that might reflect distinct mechanisms.

The development of the vertebrate brain involves the creation of many cell types 
in precise locations and at precise times, followed by the formation of
functional connections. To generate its cells in the correct numbers, the brain
has to produce many precursors during a limited period. How this is achieved
remains unclear, although several cytokines have been implicated in the
proliferation of neural precursors. Understanding this process will provide
profound insights, not only into the formation of the mammalian brain during
ontogeny, but also into brain evolution. Here we review the role of the Sonic
hedgehog-Gli pathway in brain development. Specifically, we discuss the role of
this pathway in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, and address the
implications of these findings for morphological plasticity. We also highlight
future directions of research that could help to clarify the mechanisms and
consequences of Sonic hedgehog signalling in the brain.

Binocular rivalry--the alternations in perception that occur when different
images are presented to the two eyes--has been the subject of intensive
investigation for more than 160 years. The psychophysical properties of binocular
rivalry have been well described, but newer imaging and electrophysiological
techniques have not resolved the issue of where in the brain rivalry occurs. The 
most recent evidence supports a view of rivalry as a series of processes, each of
which is implemented by neural mechanisms at different levels of the visual
hierarchy. Although unanswered questions remain, this view of rivalry might allow
us to resolve some of the controversies and apparent contradictions that have
emerged from its study.

Interventional strategies against prion diseases.

Aguzzi A, Glatzel M, Montrasio F, Prinz M, Heppner FL.

Only a few years ago, the idea that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
could be treated pharmacologically would have met with considerable scepticism.
Even now, there is no way to cure a patient or animal suffering from a manifest
prion disease. But recent, exciting developments seem to indicate that
immunological and pharmacological interventions could have some potential for the
pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of prion diseases. Although it is
unlikely that we will be able to cure the clinically overt stages of prion
diseases in the foreseeable future, palliative and even life-prolonging
interventions might no longer be confined to the realm of science fiction.

Cytokines and acute neurodegeneration.

Allan SM, Rothwell NJ.

Cytokines have been implicated as mediators and inhibitors of diverse forms of
neurodegeneration. They are induced in response to brain injury and have diverse 
actions that can cause, exacerbate, mediate and/or inhibit cellular injury and
repair. Here we review evidence for the contribution of cytokines to acute
neurodegeneration, focusing primarily on interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). TGFbeta
seems to exert primarily neuroprotective actions, whereas TNFalpha might
contribute to neuronal injury and exert protective effects. IL-1 mediates
ischaemic, excitotoxic and traumatic brain injury, probably through multiple
actions on glia, neurons and the vasculature. Understanding cytokine action in
acute neurodegeneration could lead to novel and effective therapeutic strategies,
some of which are already in clinical trials.

Classical and new roles of beta-arrestins in the regulation of G-protein-coupled 
receptors.

Biochemistry, Box 3821, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina

In the classical model of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulation, arrestins
terminate receptor signalling. After receptor activation, arrestins desensitize
phosphorylated GPCRs, blocking further activation and initiating receptor
internalization. This function of arrestins is exemplified by studies on the role
of arrestins in the development of tolerance to, but not dependence on, morphine.
Arrestins also link GPCRs to several signalling pathways, including activation of
the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC and mitogen-activated protein kinase. In
these cascades, arrestins function as adaptors and scaffolds, bringing
sequentially acting kinases into proximity with each other and the receptor. The 
signalling roles of arrestins have been expanded even further with the discovery 
that the formation of stable receptor-arrestin complexes initiates photoreceptor 
apoptosis in Drosophila, leading to retinal degeneration. Here we review our
current understanding of arrestin function, discussing both its classical and
newly discovered roles.

A neurocognitive perspective on language: the declarative/procedural model.

What are the psychological, computational and neural underpinnings of language?
Are these neurocognitive correlates dedicated to language? Do different parts of 
language depend on distinct neurocognitive systems? Here I address these and
other issues that are crucial for our understanding of two fundamental language
capacities: the memorization of words in the mental lexicon, and the
rule-governed combination of words by the mental grammar. According to the
declarative/procedural model, the mental lexicon depends on declarative memory
and is rooted in the temporal lobe, whereas the mental grammar involves
procedural memory and is rooted in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. I argue 
that the declarative/procedural model provides a new framework for the study of
lexicon and grammar.

Dynamic predictions: oscillations and synchrony in top-down processing.

Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive,
stimulus-driven device. By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the
constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective
process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is
controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of
thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming
sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions
might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing
activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this
process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be
exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of
expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and 
selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.

Addiction and the brain: the neurobiology of compulsion and its persistence.

People take addictive drugs to elevate mood, but with repeated use these drugs
produce serious unwanted effects, which can include tolerance to some drug
effects, sensitization to others, and an adapted state - dependence - which sets 
the stage for withdrawal symptoms when drug use stops. The most serious
consequence of repetitive drug taking, however, is addiction: a persistent state 
in which compulsive drug use escapes control, even when serious negative
consequences ensue. Addiction is characterized by a long-lasting risk of relapse,
which is often initiated by exposure to drug-related cues. Substantial progress
has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, but as yet we understand little of the
neural substrates of compulsive drug use and its remarkable persistence. Here we 
review evidence for the possibility that compulsion and its persistence are based
on a pathological usurpation of molecular mechanisms that are normally involved
in memory.

Functional brain imaging in humans has revealed task-specific increases in brain 
activity that are associated with various mental activities. In the same studies,
mysterious, task-independent decreases have also frequently been encountered,
especially when the tasks of interest have been compared with a passive state,
such as simple fixation or eyes closed. These decreases have raised the
possibility that there might be a baseline or resting state of brain function
involving a specific set of mental operations. We explore this possibility,
including the manner in which we might define a baseline and the implications of 
such a baseline for our understanding of brain function.

Involuntary movements--or dyskinesias--are a debilitating complication of
levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease, and is experienced in most patients.
Despite the importance of this problem, little was known about the cause of
dyskinesia until recently; however, this situation has changed significantly in
the past few years. Our increased understanding of levodopa-induced dyskinesia is
not only valuable for improving patient care, but also in providing us with new
insights into the functional organization of the basal ganglia and motor systems.

Making sense of microarray data is a complex process, in which the interpretation
of findings will depend on the overall experimental design and judgement of the
investigator performing the analysis. As a result, differences in tissue
harvesting, microarray types, sample labelling and data analysis procedures make 
post hoc sharing of microarray data a great challenge. To ensure rapid and
meaningful data exchange, we need to create some order out of the existing chaos.
In these ground-breaking microarray standardization and data sharing efforts, NIH
agencies should take a leading role

Microarray expression profiling is instrumental to our understanding of the
function of the genome. Resolution of functionally relevant expression patterns
will require the analysis of large data sets compiled from multiple
investigators. For this and other reasons, I argue that it is crucial for array
data to be publicly shared in a format as close to the 'raw data' as possible.
Issues such as protection of intellectual property, ensuring quality of the data,
and the format and timing for sharing array data are also discussed.

During the initial development of microarrays, much discussion revolved around
the technology itself. The discussion has now shifted to data analysis and data
sharing. There is great interest in the sharing of cDNA microarray data, but
several issues related to format, quality and validation will need to be resolved
before microarray data can be meaningfully integrated into other molecular
databases.

Sharing of microarray data has many advantages for the scientific and biomedical 
community, and should be advocated by neuroscience journals. The goals of sharing
are manifold, and include improving analysis and confidence in results, and
facilitating global comparisons between experiments, while at the same time, not 
penalizing those who share. The sharing of microarray data poses unique
challenges relative to more generic data such as DNA sequences. These challenges 
are surmountable, and various sharing formats are possible. Centralized
non-commercial databases are being developed to facilitate this process.

Although gap junctions were first demonstrated in the mammalian brain about 30
years ago, the distribution and role of electrical synapses have remained
elusive. A series of recent reports has demonstrated that inhibitory interneurons
in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum and cerebellum are extensively
interconnected by electrical synapses. Investigators have used paired recordings 
to reveal directly the presence of electrical synapses among identified cell
types. These studies indicate that electrical coupling is a fundamental feature
of local inhibitory circuits and suggest that electrical synapses define
functionally diverse networks of GABA-releasing interneurons. Here, we discuss
these results, their possible functional significance and the insights into

Controversy surrounds the function of the anterior cingulate cortex. Recent
discussions about its role in behavioural control have centred on three main
issues: its involvement in motor control, its proposed role in cognition and its 
relationship with the arousal/drive state of the organism. I argue that the
overlap of these three domains is key to distinguishing the anterior cingulate
cortex from other frontal regions, placing it in a unique position to translate
intentions to actions.

Neuronal migration, like the migration of many cell types, requires an extensive 
rearrangement of cell shape, mediated by changes in the cytoskeleton. The genetic
analysis of human brain malformations has identified several biochemical players 
in this process, including doublecortin (DCX) and LIS1, mutations of which cause 
a profound migratory disturbance known as lissencephaly ('smooth brain') in
humans. Studies in mice have identified additional molecules such as Cdk5, P35,
Reelin, Disabled and members of the LDL superfamily of receptors. Understanding
the cell biology of these molecules has been a challenge, and it is not known
whether they function in related biochemical pathways or in very distinct
processes. The last year has seen rapid advances in the biochemical analysis of
several such molecules. This analysis has revealed roles for some of these
molecules in cytoskeletal regulation and has shown an unexpected conservation of 
the genetic pathways that regulate neuronal migration in humans and nuclear
movement in simple eukaryotic organisms.

Voltage-gated Na+ channels set the threshold for action potential generation and 
are therefore good candidates to mediate forms of plasticity that affect the
entire neuronal output. Although early studies led to the idea that Na+ channels 
were not subject to modulation, we now know that Na+ channel function is affected
by phosphorylation. Furthermore, Na+ channel modulation is implicated in the
control of input-output relationships in several types of neuron and seems to be 
involved in phenomena as varied as cocaine withdrawal, hyperalgesia and light
adaptation. Here we review the available evidence for the regulation of Na+
channels by phosphorylation, its molecular mechanism, and the possible ways in
which it affects neuronal function.

Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) channel
gene encode a family of at least 20 ion channel proteins. They are widely
distributed in mammalian tissues, but their specific physiological functions are 
largely unknown. A common theme that links the TRP channels is their activation
or modulation by phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathways. The channel
subunits have six transmembrane domains that most probably assemble into
tetramers to form non-selective cationic channels, which allow for the influx of 
calcium ions into cells. Three subgroups comprise the TRP channel family; the
best understood of these mediates responses to painful stimuli. Other proposed
functions include repletion of intracellular calcium stores, receptor-mediated
excitation and modulation of the cell cycle.

For over 60 years, ideas about emotion in neuroscience and psychology have been
dominated by a debate on whether emotion can be encompassed within a single,
unifying model. In neuroscience, this approach is epitomized by the limbic system
theory and, in psychology, by dimensional models of emotion. Comparative research
has gradually eroded the limbic model, and some scientists have proposed that
certain individual emotions are represented separately in the brain. Evidence
from humans consistent with this approach has recently been obtained by studies
indicating that signals of fear and disgust are processed by distinct neural
substrates. We review this research and its implications for theories of emotion.

Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide, but we know little about the
underlying fundamental biology. Research is hindered by the difficulties of
modelling a disorder of higher cognitive functions in animals. Depression can be 
understood as the interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental
factors; however, current classifications are purely descriptive. The complexity 
of this field is best approached by rigorous explorations of known candidate
systems in conjunction with the use of genomic tools to discover new targets for 
antidepressants and to predict therapeutic outcomes.

Recent studies have shown that components of the cell-cycle machinery can have
diverse and unexpected roles in the retina. Cyclin-kinase inhibitors, for
example, have been implicated as regulators of cell-fate decisions during
histogenesis and reactive gliosis in the adult tissue after injury. Also, various
mechanisms have been identified that can compensate for extra rounds of cell
division when the normal timing of the cell-cycle exit is perturbed.
Surprisingly, distinct components of the cell-cycle machinery seem to be used
during different stages of development, and different organisms might rely on
distinct pathways. Such detailed studies on the regulation of proliferation in
complex multicellular tissues during development have not only advanced our
knowledge of the ways in which proliferation is controlled, but might also help
us to understand the degenerative disorders that are associated with gliosis and 
some types of tumorigenesis.

Research into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been rapidly advanced
by the development of animal models. Initial models were developed by using
toxins that specifically targeted dopamine neurons, the most successful of which 
used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a toxin that causes
parkinsonism in man. More recently, the identification of alpha-synuclein
mutations as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease has led to the development of
alpha-synuclein transgenic mice and Drosophila. Here, I discuss the merits and
limitations of these different animal models in our attempts to understand the
physiology of Parkinson's disease and to develop new therapies.

Activity-mediated changes in the strength of synaptic communication are important
for the establishment of proper neuronal connections during development and for
the experience-dependent modification of neural circuitry that is believed to
underlie all forms of behavioural plasticity. Owing to the wide-ranging
significance of synaptic plasticity, considerable efforts have been made to
identify the mechanisms by which synaptic changes are triggered and expressed.
New evidence indicates that one important expression mechanism of several
long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity might involve the physical transport of
AMPA-type glutamate receptors in and out of the synaptic membrane. Here, we focus
on the rapidly accumulating evidence that AMPA receptors undergo regulated
endocytosis, which is important for long-term depression.

Acetylcholinesterase--new roles for an old actor.

Erratum in
    Nat Rev Neurosci 2001 Sep;2(9):670.

The discovery of the first neurotransmitter--acetylcholine--was soon followed by 
the discovery of its hydrolysing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase. The role of
acetylcholinesterase in terminating acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission made
it the focus of intense research for much of the past century. But the complexity
of acetylcholinesterase gene regulation and recent evidence for some of the
long-suspected 'non-classical' actions of this enzyme have more recently driven a
profound revolution in acetylcholinesterase research. Although our understanding 
of the additional roles of acetylcholinesterase is incomplete, the time is ripe
to summarize the evidence on a remarkable diversity of acetylcholinesterase
functions.

A unified hypothesis on the lineage of neural stem cells.

Alvarez-Buylla A, García-Verdugo JM, Tramontin AD.

For many years, it was assumed that neurons and glia in the central nervous
system were produced from two distinct precursor pools that diverged early during
embryonic development. This theory was partially based on the idea that
neurogenesis and gliogenesis occurred during different periods of development,
and that neurogenesis ceased perinatally. However, there is now abundant evidence
that neural stem cells persist in the adult brain and support ongoing
neurogenesis in restricted regions of the central nervous system. Surprisingly,
these stem cells have the characteristics of fully differentiated glia.
Neuroepithelial stem cells in the embryonic neural tube do not show glial
characteristics, raising questions about the putative lineage from embryonic to
adult stem cells. In the developing brain, radial glia have long been known to
produce cortical astrocytes, but recent data indicate that radial glia might also
divide asymmetrically to produce cortical neurons. Here we review these new
developments and propose that the stem cells in the central nervous system are
contained within the neuroepithelial --> radial glia --> astrocyte lineage.

Examples of G-protein-coupled receptors that can be biochemically detected in
homo- or heteromeric complexes are emerging at an accelerated rate. Biophysical
approaches have confirmed the existence of several such complexes in living cells
and there is strong evidence to support the idea that dimerization is important
in different aspects of receptor biogenesis and function. While the existence of 
G-protein-coupled-receptor homodimers raises fundamental questions about the
molecular mechanisms involved in transmitter recognition and signal transduction,
the formation of heterodimers raises fascinating combinatorial possibilities that
could underlie an unexpected level of pharmacological diversity, and contribute
to cross-talk regulation between transmission systems. Because G-protein-coupled 
receptors are major pharmacological targets, the existence of dimers could have
important implications for the development and screening of new drugs. Here, we
review the evidence supporting the existence of G-protein-coupled-receptor
dimerization and discuss its functional importance.

Although spontaneous regeneration of lesioned fibres is limited in the adult
central nervous system, many people that suffer from incomplete spinal cord
injuries show significant functional recovery. This recovery process can go on
for several years after the injury and probably depends on the reorganization of 
circuits that have been spared by the lesion. Synaptic plasticity in pre-existing
pathways and the formation of new circuits through collateral sprouting of
lesioned and unlesioned fibres are important components of this recovery process.
These reorganization processes might occur in cortical and subcortical motor
centres, in the spinal cord below the lesion, and in the spared fibre tracts that
connect these centres. Functional and anatomical evidence exists that spontaneous
plasticity can be potentiated by activity, as well as by specific experimental
manipulations. These studies prepare the way to a better understanding of
rehabilitation treatments and to the development of new approaches to treat
spinal cord injury.

The development of cortical layers, areas and networks is mediated by a
combination of factors that are present in the cortex and are influenced by
thalamic input. Electrical activity of thalamocortical afferents has a
progressive role in shaping cortex. For early thalamic innervation and
patterning, the presence of activity might be sufficient; for features that
develop later, such as intracortical networks that mediate emergent responses of 
cortex, the spatiotemporal pattern of activity often has an instructive role.
Experiments that route projections from the retina to the auditory pathway alter 
the pattern of activity in auditory thalamocortical afferents at a very early
stage and reveal the progressive influence of activity on cortical development.
Thus, cortical features such as layers and thalamocortical innervation are
unaffected, whereas features that develop later, such as intracortical
connections, are affected significantly. Surprisingly, the behavioural role of
'rewired' cortex is also influenced profoundly, indicating the importance of
patterned activity for this key aspect of cortical function.

Control of nerve-cell excitability is crucial for normal brain function. Two main
groups of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors--GABA(A) and glycine
receptors--fulfil a significant part of this role. To mediate fast synaptic
inhibition effectively, these receptors need to be localized and affixed opposite
nerve terminals that release the appropriate neurotransmitter at multiple sites
on postsynaptic neurons. But for this to occur, neurons require intracellular
anchoring molecules, as well as mechanisms that ensure the efficient turnover and
transport of mature, functional inhibitory synaptic receptor proteins. This
review describes the dynamic regulation of synaptic GABA(A) and glycine receptors
and discusses recent advances in this rapidly evolving field.

The emergence of a unified cognitive moment relies on the coordination of
scattered mosaics of functionally specialized brain regions. Here we review the
mechanisms of large-scale integration that counterbalance the distributed
anatomical and functional organization of brain activity to enable the emergence 
of coherent behaviour and cognition. Although the mechanisms involved in
large-scale integration are still largely unknown, we argue that the most
plausible candidate is the formation of dynamic links mediated by synchrony over 
multiple frequency bands.

Cognitive neuropsychiatry represents a systematic and theoretically driven
approach to explain clinical psychopathologies in terms of deficits to normal
cognitive mechanisms. A concern with the neural substrates of impaired cognitive 
mechanisms links cognitive neuropsychiatry to the basic neurosciences. The
emergence of cognitive neuropsychiatry in the 1990s illustrates the growing
rapprochement between cognitive neuropsychology, clinical medicine and the
neurosciences in addressing common questions about disorders of the mind/brain.
In reviewing recent applications, we highlight how this hybrid discipline will
make a distinctive contribution to the science of psychopathology.

Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are largely known for their involvement in brain
development but, as some of these receptor tyrosine kinases are also expressed in
adults, their possible role in the mature nervous system has begun to be
explored. Evidence for the involvement of Eph receptors in synaptic plasticity,
learning and memory is only emerging and needs corroboration. However, it is
likely that the actions of Eph kinases in the adult brain will attract
significant attention and become a fertile research area, as occurred in the case
of the neurotrophins.

Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of
focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of
attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically
depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that
topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved
to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of
return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from
being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth,
attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges
with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene 
understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended
locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a
computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.

Glial cells are emerging from the background to become more prominent in our
thinking about integration in the nervous system. Given that glial cells
associated with synapses integrate neuronal inputs and can release transmitters
that modulate synaptic activity, it is time to rethink our understanding of the
wiring diagram of the nervous system. It is no longer appropriate to consider
solely neuron-neuron connections; we also need to develop a view of the intricate
web of active connections among glial cells, and between glia and neurons.
Without such a view, it might be impossible to decode the language of the brain.

With a bang, a new family of potassium channels has exploded into view. Although 
KCNK channels were discovered only five years ago, they already outnumber other
channel types. KCNK channels are easy to identify because of their unique
structure--they possess two preforming domains in each subunit. The new channels 
function in a most remarkable fashion: they are highly regulated,
potassium-selective leak channels. Although leak currents are fundamental to the 
function of nerves and muscles, the molecular basis for this type of conductance 
had been a mystery. Here we review the discovery of KCNK channels, what has been 
learned about them and what lies ahead. Even though two-P-domain channels are
widespread and essential, they were hidden from sight in plain view--our most
basic questions remain to be answered.

The control of cell movement during development is essential for forming and
stabilizing the spatial organization of tissues and cell types. During initial
steps of tissue patterning, distinct regional domains or cell types arise at
appropriate locations, and the movement of cells is constrained in order to
maintain spatial relationships during growth. In other situations, the guidance
of migrating cells or neuronal growth cones to specific destinations underlies
the establishment or remodeling of a pattern. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and
their ephrin ligands are key players in controlling these cell movements in many 
tissues and at multiple stages of patterning.

Two organizing centres operate at long-range distances within the anterior neural
plate to pattern the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Important progress has
been made in understanding the formation and function of one of these organizing 
centres, the isthmic organizer, which controls the development of the midbrain
and anterior hindbrain. Here we review our current knowledge on the identity,
localization and maintenance of the isthmic organizer, as well as on the
molecular cascades that underlie the activity of this organizing centre.

For three-quarters of a century, developmental biologists have been asking how
the nervous system is specified as distinct from the rest of the ectoderm during 
early development, and how it becomes subdivided initially into distinct regions 
such as forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. The two events of 'neural
induction' and 'early neural patterning' seem to be intertwined, and many models 
have been put forward to explain how these processes work at a molecular level.
Here I consider early neural patterning and discuss the evidence for and against 
the two most popular models proposed for its explanation: the idea that multiple 
signalling centres (organizers) are responsible for inducing different regions of
the nervous system, and a model first articulated by Nieuwkoop that invokes two
steps (activation/transformation) necessary for neural patterning. As recent
evidence from several systems challenges both models, I propose a modification of
Nieuwkoop's model that most easily accommodates both classical and more recent
data, and end by outlining some possible directions for future research.

Pain is necessary for survival, but persistent pain can result in anxiety,
depression and a reduction in the quality of life. The discriminative and
affective qualities of pain are both thought to be regulated in an
activity-dependent fashion. Recent studies have identified cells and molecules
that regulate pain sensitivity and the parallel pathways that distribute
nociceptive information to limbic or sensory areas of the forebrain. Here, we
emphasize the cellular and neurobiological consequences of pain, especially those
that are involved in the generation and maintenance of chronic pain. These new
insights into pain processing will significantly alter our approach to pain
control and the development of new analgesics.

It is difficult to think of any behavioural process that is more intrinsically
important to us than attachment. Feeding, sleeping and locomotion are all
necessary for survival, but humans are, as Baruch Spinoza famously noted, "a
social animal" and it is our social attachments that we live for. Over the past
decade, studies in a range of vertebrates, including humans, have begun to
address the neural basis of attachment at a molecular, cellular and systems
level. This review describes some of the important insights from this work.

Studies of human addicts and behavioural studies in rodent models of addiction
indicate that key behavioural abnormalities associated with addiction are
extremely long lived. So, chronic drug exposure causes stable changes in the
brain at the molecular and cellular levels that underlie these behavioural
abnormalities. There has been considerable progress in identifying the mechanisms
that contribute to long-lived neural and behavioural plasticity related to
addiction, including drug-induced changes in gene transcription, in RNA and
protein processing, and in synaptic structure. Although the specific changes
identified so far are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the nearly
permanent changes in behaviour associated with addiction, recent work has pointed
to the types of mechanism that could be involved.

Postmitotic neurons are produced from a pool of cycling progenitors in an orderly
fashion during development. Studies of cell-fate determination in the vertebrate 
retina have uncovered several fundamental principles by which this is achieved.
Most notably, a model for vertebrate cell-fate determination has been proposed
that combines findings on the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic
regulators in controlling cell-fate choices. At the heart of the model is the
proposal that progenitors pass through intrinsically determined competence
states, during which they are capable of giving rise to a limited subset of cell 
types under the influence of extrinsic signals.

Recent evidence indicates that an old memory reactivated by cueing becomes labile
and vulnerable to an amnesic treatment. Although the 'reconsolidation' concept
derived from these findings challenges the traditional consolidation theory, here
we argue that the new concept suffers from some of the same limitations as the
earlier model. We propose an alternative retrieval-based theory that accommodates
the recent data, as well as other puzzling related observations.

The hallmark of medial temporal lobe amnesia is a loss of episodic memory such
that patients fail to remember new events that are set in an autobiographical
context (an episode). A further symptom is a loss of recognition memory. The
relationship between these two features has recently become contentious. Here, we
focus on the central issue in this dispute--the relative contributions of the
hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex to recognition memory. A resolution is
vital not only for uncovering the neural substrates of these key aspects of
memory, but also for understanding the processes disrupted in medial temporal
lobe amnesia and the validity of animal models of this syndrome.

Splicing of pre-messenger RNA is regulated differently in the brain compared with
other tissues. Recognition of aberrations in splicing events that are associated 
with neurological disease has contributed to our understanding of disease
pathogenesis in some cases. Neuron-specific proteins involved in RNA splicing and
metabolism are also affected in several neurological disorders. These findings
have begun to bridge what we know about the mechanisms regulating neuron-specific
splicing and our understanding of neural function and disease.

The ability and opportunity to make decisions and carry out effective actions in 
pursuit of goals is central to intelligent life. Recent research has provided
significant new insights into how the brain arrives at decisions, makes choices, 
and produces and evaluates the consequences of actions. In fact, by monitoring or
manipulating specific neurons, certain choices can now be predicted or
manipulated.

The role of neurotrophins as regulatory factors that mediate the differentiation 
and survival of neurons has been well described. More recent evidence indicates
that neurotrophins may also act as synaptic modulators. Here, I review the
evidence that synaptic activity regulates the synthesis, secretion and action of 
neurotrophins, which can in turn induce immediate changes in synaptic efficacy
and morphology. By this account, neurotrophins may participate in
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, linking synaptic activity with long-term 
functional and structural modification of synaptic connections.

Local-circuit, gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing inhibitory interneurons of the
hippocampus and cortex have traditionally been considered as the regulators of
principal neuron activity--the yin to the excitatory yang. Recent evidence
indicates that, in addition to that role, their network connectivity and the
properties of their intrinsic voltage-gated currents are finely tuned to permit
inhibitory interneurons to generate and control the rhythmic output of large
populations of both principal cells and other populations of inhibitory
interneurons. This review brings together recently described properties and
emerging principles of interneuron function that indicate a much more complex
role for these cells than just providers of inhibition.

'Consolidation' has been used to describe distinct but related processes. In
considering the implications of our recent findings on the lability of
reactivated fear memories, we view consolidation and reconsolidation in terms of 
molecular events taking place within neurons as opposed to interactions between
brain regions. Our findings open up a new dimension in the study of memory
consolidation. We argue that consolidation is not a one-time event, but instead
is reiterated with subsequent activation of the memories.

The observation that retrieval returns a stable memory into a labile state cannot
be readily explained by any simple version of consolidation theory. This finding 
has been interpreted as evidence for the need to reconsolidate a memory after
reactivating it. However, as we discuss in this commentary, other behavioural
observations indicate that even this modification to consolidation theory may be 
insufficient to describe the dynamic properties of memory.

The fundamental biological importance of rewards has created an increasing
interest in the neuronal processing of reward information. The suggestion that
the mechanisms underlying drug addiction might involve natural reward systems has
also stimulated interest. This article focuses on recent neurophysiological
studies in primates that have revealed that neurons in a limited number of brain 
structures carry specific signals about past and future rewards. This research
provides the first step towards an understanding of how rewards influence
behaviour before they are received and how the brain might use reward information
to control learning and goal-directed behaviour.

Neuronal plasticity is a central theme of modern neurobiology, from cellular and 
molecular mechanisms of synapse formation in Drosophila to behavioural recovery
from strokes in elderly humans. Although the methods used to measure plastic
responses differ, the stimuli required to elicit plasticity are thought to be
activity-dependent. In this article, we focus on the neuronal changes that occur 
in response to complex stimulation by an enriched environment. We emphasize the
behavioural and neurobiological consequences of specific elements of enrichment, 
especially exercise and learning.

A fundamental function of nerve cells is the transformation of incoming synaptic 
information into specific patterns of action potential output. An important
component of this transformation is synaptic integration--the combination of
voltage deflections produced by a myriad of synaptic inputs into a singular
change in membrane potential. There are three basic elements involved in
integration: the amplitude of the unitary postsynaptic potential; the manner in
which non-simultaneous unitary events add in time (temporal summation), and the
addition of unitary events occurring simultaneously in separate regions of the
dendritic arbor (spatial summation). This review discusses how passive and active
dendritic properties, and the functional characteristics of the synapse, shape
these three elements of synaptic integration.

The Rho family of small GTPases act as intracellular molecular switches that
transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to the actin cytoskeleton and the
nucleus. Recent evidence implicates Rho GTPases in the regulation of neuronal
morphogenesis, including migration, polarity, axon growth and guidance, dendrite 
elaboration and plasticity, and synapse formation. Signalling pathways from
membrane receptors to Rho GTPases and from Rho GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton 
are beginning to be discovered. Mutations in these signalling pathways have been 
reported in human neurological diseases, which underscores their importance in
the development and function of the nervous system.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a special form of vesicle budding important for 
the internalization of receptors and extracellular ligands, for the recycling of 
plasma membrane components, and for the retrieval of surface proteins destined
for degradation. In nerve terminals, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is crucial for
synaptic vesicle recycling. Recent structural studies have provided molecular
details of coat assembly. In addition, biochemical and genetic studies have
identified numerous accessory proteins that assist the clathrin coat in its
function at synapses and in other systems. This review summarizes these advances 
with a special focus on accessory factors and highlights new aspects of
clathrin-mediated endocytosis revealed by the study of these factors.

We are not passive recipients of the information that impinges on our retinae,
but active participants in our own perceptual processes. Visual experience
depends critically on attention. We select particular aspects of a visual scene
for detailed analysis and control of subsequent behaviour, but ignore other
aspects so completely that moments after they disappear from view we cannot
report anything about them. Here we show that functional neuroimaging is
revealing much more than where attention happens in the brain; it is beginning to
answer some of the oldest and deepest questions about what visual attention is
and how it works.

Psychophysical and physiological studies have shown that attending to a stimulus 
can enhance its sensory processing. Functional imaging studies now reveal that
attention can also modulate activity in sensory brain areas before stimulus
onset, when the observer prepares to attend to an anticipated stimulus. These
preparatory 'baseline shifts' in brain activity pose many new questions, and
potentially offer new insights into the neural basis of perceptual awareness.

beginning to yield the cardinal example of the molecular-genetic control of
behaviour. This perspective describes recent evidence for the conservation of a
double-loop, autoregulatory feedback mechanism across the best understood
eukaryotic circadian systems, and discusses how these findings may illuminate
some long-standing puzzles concerning our subliminal sense of circadian time.

Dynamic regulation of synaptic efficacy is one of the mechanisms thought to
underlie learning and memory. Many of the observed changes in efficacy, such as
long-term potentiation and long-term depression, result from the functional
alteration of excitatory neurotransmission mediated by postsynaptic glutamate
receptors. These changes may result from the modulation of the receptors
themselves and from regulation of protein networks associated with glutamate
receptors. Understanding the interactions in this synaptic complex will yield
invaluable insight into the molecular basis of synaptic function. This review
focuses on the molecular organization of excitatory synapses and the processes
involved in the dynamic regulation of glutamate receptors.

Information is encoded in the brain by populations or clusters of cells, rather
than by single cells. This encoding strategy is known as population coding. Here 
we review the standard use of population codes for encoding and decoding
information, and consider how population codes can be used to support neural
computations such as noise removal and nonlinear mapping. More radical ideas
about how population codes may directly represent information about stimulus
uncertainty are also discussed.

Understanding the patterning mechanisms that control head
development--particularly the neural crest and its contribution to bones, nerves 
and connective tissue--is an important problem, as craniofacial anomalies account
for one-third of all human congenital defects. Classical models for craniofacial 
patterning argue that the morphogenic program and Hox gene identity of the neural
crest is pre-patterned, carrying positional information acquired in the hindbrain
to the peripheral nervous system and the branchial arches. Recently, however,
plasticity of Hox gene expression has been observed in the hindbrain and cranial 
neural crest of chick, mouse and zebrafish embryos. Hence, craniofacial
development is not dependent on neural crest prepatterning, but is regulated by a
more complex integration of cell and tissue interactions.

Two decades ago, molecular genetic analysis provided a new approach for defining 
the roots of inherited disorders. This strategy has proved particularly powerful 
because, with only a description of the inheritance pattern, it can uncover
previously unsuspected mechanisms of pathogenesis that are not implicated by
known biological pathways or by the disease manifestations. Nowhere has the
impact of molecular genetics been more evident than in the dominantly inherited
neurodegenerative disorders, where eight unrelated diseases have been revealed to
possess the same type of mutation--an expanded polyglutamine encoding
sequence--affecting different genes.

New perspectives on spinal motor systems.

The production and control of complex motor functions are usually attributed to
central brain structures such as cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum. In
traditional schemes the spinal cord is assigned a subservient function during the
production of movement, playing a predominantly passive role by relaying the
commands dictated to it by supraspinal systems. This review challenges this idea 
by presenting evidence that the spinal motor system is an active participant in
several aspects of the production of movement, contributing to functions normally
ascribed to 'higher' brain regions.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used to investigate almost all areas
of cognitive neuroscience. This article discusses the most important (and least
understood) considerations regarding the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation
for cognitive neuroscience and outlines advances in the use of this technique for
the replication and extension of findings from neuropsychology. We also take a
more speculative look forward to the emerging development of strategies for
combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with other brain imaging technologies
and methods in the cognitive neurosciences.

For over 100 years a central assumption in the field of neuroscience has been
that new neurons are not added to the adult mammalian brain. This perspective
examines the origins of this dogma, its perseverance in the face of contradictory
evidence, and its final collapse. The acceptance of adult neurogenesis may be
part of a contemporary paradigm shift in our view of the plasticity and stability
of the adult brain.

One of the enduring mysteries of brain function concerns the process of cognitive
control. How does complex and seemingly willful behaviour emerge from
interactions between millions of neurons? This has long been suspected to depend 
on the prefrontal cortex--the neocortex at the anterior end of the brain--but now
we are beginning to uncover its neural basis. Nearly all intended behaviour is
learned and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the
'rules of the game' needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation. Studies 
indicate that the prefrontal cortex is central in this process. It provides an
infrastructure for synthesizing a diverse range of information that lays the
foundation for the complex forms of behaviour observed in primates.

Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts an
increasing part of our ageing population. An isoform of apolipoprotein E, a
protein that mediates the transport of lipids and cholesterol in the circulatory 
system, predisposes carriers of this allele to the common late-onset form of the 
disease. How this protein is related to a neurodegenerative disorder is an
enigma. Mounting evidence indicates that apolipoprotein E receptors, which are
abundantly expressed in most neurons in the central nervous system, also fulfill 
critical functions during brain development and may profoundly influence the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

A cortical-hippocampal system for declarative memory.

Recent neurobiological studies have begun to reveal the cognitive and neural
coding mechanisms that underlie declarative memory--our ability to recollect
everyday events and factual knowledge. These studies indicate that the critical
circuitry involves bidirectional connections between the neocortex, the
parahippocampal region and the hippocampus. Each of these areas makes a unique
contribution to memory processing. Widespread high-order neocortical areas
provide dedicated processors for perceptual, motor or cognitive information that 
is influenced by other components of the system. The parahippocampal region
mediates convergence of this information and extends the persistence of
neocortical memory representations. The hippocampus encodes the sequences of
places and events that compose episodic memories, and links them together through
their common elements. Here I describe how these mechanisms work together to
create and re-create fully networked representations of previous experiences and 
knowledge about the world.

Songbirds are one of the best-studied examples of vocal learners. Learning of
both human speech and birdsong depends on hearing. Once learned, adult song in
many species remains unchanging, suggesting a reduced influence of sensory
experience. Recent studies have revealed, however, that adult song is not always 
stable, extending our understanding of the mechanisms involved in song
maintenance, and their similarity to those active during song learning. Here we
review some of the processes that contribute to song learning and production,
with an emphasis on the role of auditory feedback. We then consider some of the
possible neural substrates involved in these processes, particularly basal
ganglia circuitry. Although a thorough treatment of human speech is beyond the
scope of this article, we point out similarities between speech and song
learning, and ways in which studies of these disparate behaviours complement each
other in developing an understanding of general principles that contribute to
learning and maintenance of vocal behaviour.

Humans have over 70 potassium channel genes, but only some of these have been
linked to disease. In this respect, the KCNQ family of potassium channels is
exceptional: mutations in four out of five KCNQ genes underlie diseases including
cardiac arrhythmias, deafness and epilepsy. These disorders illustrate the
different physiological functions of KCNQ channels, and provide a model for the
study of the 'safety margin' that separates normal from pathological levels of
channel expression. In addition, several KCNQ isoforms can associate to form
heteromeric channels that underlie the M-current, an important regulator of
neuronal excitability.

In 1894, Ramón y Cajal first proposed that memory is stored as an anatomical
change in the strength of neuronal connections. For the following 60 years,
little evidence was recruited in support of this idea. This situation changed in 
the middle of the twentieth century with the development of cellular techniques
for the study of synaptic connections and the emergence of new formulations of
synaptic plasticity that redefined Ramón y Cajal's idea, making it more suitable 
for testing. These formulations defined two categories of plasticity, referred to
as homosynaptic or Hebbian activity-dependent, and heterosynaptic or modulatory
input-dependent. Here we suggest that Hebbian mechanisms are used primarily for
learning and for short-term memory but often cannot, by themselves, recruit the
events required to maintain a long-term memory. In contrast, heterosynaptic
plasticity commonly recruits long-term memory mechanisms that lead to
transcription and to synpatic growth. When jointly recruited, homosynaptic
mechanisms assure that learning is effectively established and heterosynaptic
mechanisms ensure that memory is maintained.
