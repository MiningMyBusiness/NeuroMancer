"Although it is well established that all brain regions contain various neuronal subtypes with different functions, astrocytes have traditionally been thought to be homogenous. However, recent evidence has shown that astrocytes in the mammalian CNS display distinct inter- and intra-regional features, as well as functional diversity. In the CNS, astrocyte processes fill the local environment in non-overlapping domains. Therefore, a potential advantage of region-specified astrocytes might be their capacity to regulate local development or optimize local neural circuit function. An overview of the regional heterogeneity of neuron-astrocyte interactions indicates novel ways in which they could regulate normal neurological function and shows how they might become dysregulated in disease.", ,"Glucocorticoid stress hormones are crucially involved in modulating mnemonic processing of emotionally arousing experiences. They enhance the consolidation of new memories, including those that extinguish older memories, but impair the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory. As strong aversive memories lie at the core of several fear-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias, the memory-modulating properties of glucocorticoids have recently become of considerable translational interest. Clinical trials have provided the first evidence that glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies aimed at attenuating aversive memories might be helpful in the treatment of fear-related disorders. Here, we review important advances in the understanding of how glucocorticoids mediate stress effects on memory processes, and discuss the translational potential of these new conceptual insights.","Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use, manipulate and generalize knowledge that is acquired over the lifespan to support innumerable verbal and non-verbal behaviours. This Review summarizes key findings and issues arising from a decade of research into the neurocognitive and neurocomputational underpinnings of this ability, leading to a new framework that we term controlled semantic cognition (CSC). CSC offers solutions to long-standing queries in philosophy and cognitive science, and yields a convergent framework for understanding the neural and computational bases of healthy semantic cognition and its dysfunction in brain disorders.","Neurofeedback is a psychophysiological procedure in which online feedback of neural activation is provided to the participant for the purpose of self-regulation. Learning control over specific neural substrates has been shown to change specific behaviours. As a progenitor of brain-machine interfaces, neurofeedback has provided a novel way to investigate brain function and neuroplasticity. In this Review, we examine the mechanisms underlying neurofeedback, which have started to be uncovered. We also discuss how neurofeedback is being used in novel experimental and clinical paradigms from a multidisciplinary perspective, encompassing neuroscientific, neuroengineering and learning-science viewpoints.", , , , , , , , , ,"Chronic pain is not simply a temporal continuum of acute pain. Studies on functional plasticity in neural circuits of pain have provided mechanistic insights and linked various modulatory factors to a change in perception and behaviour. However, plasticity also occurs in the context of structural remodelling and reorganisation of synapses, cells and circuits, potentially contributing to the long-term nature of chronic pain. This Review discusses maladaptive structural plasticity in neural circuits of pain, spanning multiple anatomical and spatial scales in animal models and human patients, and addresses key questions on structure-function relationships.", ,"The human subcortex is a densely populated part of the brain, of which only 7% of the individual structures are depicted in standard MRI atlases. In vivo MRI of the subcortex is challenging owing to its anatomical complexity and its deep location in the brain. The technical advances that are needed to reliably uncover this 'terra incognita' call for an interdisciplinary human neuroanatomical approach. We discuss the emerging methods that could be used in such an approach and the incorporation of the data that are generated from these methods into model-based cognitive neuroscience frameworks.", , , ,"The function of neural circuits and networks can be controlled, in part, by modulating the synchrony of their components' activities. Network hypersynchrony and altered oscillatory rhythmic activity may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this condition, network activities that support cognition are altered decades before clinical disease onset, and these alterations predict future pathology and brain atrophy. Although the precise causes and pathophysiological consequences of these network alterations remain to be defined, interneuron dysfunction and network abnormalities have emerged as potential mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in AD and related disorders. Here, we explore the concept that modulating these mechanisms may help to improve brain function in these conditions.", ,"Integrins are a large family of extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors. In the developing and adult brain, many integrins are present at high levels at synapses. The tetrapartite structure of synapses - which comprises presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, the ECM and glial processes - places synaptic integrins in an excellent position to sense dynamic changes in the synaptic environment and use this information to coordinate further changes in synapse structure and function that will shape neural circuit properties. Recent developments in our understanding of the cellular and physiological roles of integrins, which range from control of neural process outgrowth and synapse formation to regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory, enable us to attempt a synthesis of synaptic integrin function.", , , , , ,"It is becoming clear that the manner by which the immune response resolves or contains infection by a pathogen varies according to the tissue that is affected. Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus, the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune response - when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS - provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.", ,"The mirror mechanism is a basic brain mechanism that transforms sensory representations of others' behaviour into one's own motor or visceromotor representations concerning that behaviour. According to its location in the brain, it may fulfil a range of cognitive functions, including action and emotion understanding. In each case, it may enable a route to knowledge of others' behaviour, which mainly depends on one's own motor or visceromotor representations.", ,DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.158 PMID: 27881855  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher], , ,"Nonrandom chromosomal conformations, including promoter-enhancer loopings that bypass kilobases or megabases of linear genome, provide a crucial layer of transcriptional regulation and move vast amounts of non-coding sequence into the physical proximity of genes that are important for neurodevelopment, cognition and behaviour. Activity-regulated changes in the neuronal '3D genome' could govern transcriptional mechanisms associated with learning and plasticity, and loop-bound intergenic and intronic non-coding sequences have been implicated in psychiatric and adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies have begun to clarify the roles of spatial genome organization in normal and abnormal cognition.", ,"Most research on mind-wandering has characterized it as a mental state with contents that are task unrelated or stimulus independent. However, the dynamics of mind-wandering - how mental states change over time - have remained largely neglected. Here, we introduce a dynamic framework for understanding mind-wandering and its relationship to the recruitment of large-scale brain networks. We propose that mind-wandering is best understood as a member of a family of spontaneous-thought phenomena that also includes creative thought and dreaming. This dynamic framework can shed new light on mental disorders that are marked by alterations in spontaneous thought, including depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", , ,"Topoisomerases are unique enzymes that regulate torsional stress in DNA to enable essential genome functions, including DNA replication and transcription. Although all cells in an organism require topoisomerases to maintain normal function, the nervous system in particular shows a vital need for these enzymes. Indeed, a range of inherited human neurologic syndromes, including neurodegeneration, schizophrenia and intellectual impairment, are associated with aberrant topoisomerase function. Much remains unknown regarding the tissue-specific function of neural topoisomerases or the connections between these enzymes and disease aetiology. Precisely how topoisomerases regulate genome dynamics within the nervous system is therefore a crucial research question.", , ,"Goal-directed social behaviours such as mating and fighting are associated with scalable and persistent internal states of emotion, motivation, arousal or drive. How those internal states are encoded and coupled to behavioural decision making and action selection is not clear. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster and mice have identified circuit nodes that have causal roles in the control of innate social behaviours. Remarkably, in both species, these relatively small groups of neurons can influence both aggression and mating, and also play a part in the encoding of internal states that promote these social behaviours. These similarities may be superficial and coincidental, or may reflect conserved or analogous neural circuit modules for the control of social behaviours in flies and mice.", , , ,"General anaesthesia is usually considered to safely induce a reversible brain state allowing the performance of surgery under optimal conditions. An increasing number of clinical and experimental observations, however, suggest that anaesthetic drugs, especially when they are administered at the extremes of age, can trigger long-term morphological and functional alterations in the brain. Here, we review available mechanistic data linking general-anaesthesia exposure to impaired cognitive performance in both young and mature nervous systems. We also provide a critical appraisal of the translational value of animal models and highlight the important challenges that need to be addressed to strengthen the link between laboratory work and clinical investigations in the field of anaesthesia-neurotoxicity research.","Dysregulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-urocortin (UCN) system has been implicated in stress-related psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety. It has been proposed that CRF-CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1) signalling promotes the stress response and anxiety-like behaviour, whereas UCNs and CRFR2 activation mediate stress recovery and the restoration of homeostasis. Recent findings, however, provide clear evidence that this view is overly simplistic. Instead, a more complex picture has emerged that suggests that there are brain region- and cell type-specific effects of CRFR signalling that are influenced by the individual's prior experience and that shape molecular, cellular and ultimately behavioural responses to stressful challenges.", ,"GluN3-containing NMDA receptors (GluN3-NMDARs) are rarer than the 'classical' NMDARs, which are composed solely of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, and have non-conventional biophysical, trafficking and signalling properties. In the CNS, they seem to have important roles in delaying synapse maturation until the arrival of sensory experience and in targeting non-used synapses for pruning. The reactivation of GluN3A expression at inappropriate ages may underlie maladaptive synaptic rearrangements observed in addiction, neurodegenerative diseases and other major brain disorders. Here, we discuss current evidence for these and other emerging roles for GluN3-NMDARs in the physiology and pathology of the CNS.", , , , , ,"As polarized cells, neurons maintain different sets of resident plasma membrane proteins in their axons and dendrites, which is consistent with the different roles that these neurites have in electrochemical signalling. Axonal and dendritic proteins are synthesized together within the somatodendritic domain; this raises a fundamental question: what is the nature of the intracellular trafficking machinery that ensures that these proteins reach the correct domain? Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the processes underlying the selective sorting and selective transport of axonal and dendritic proteins and have created potential avenues for future progress.","Maltreatment-related childhood adversity is the leading preventable risk factor for mental illness and substance abuse. Although the association between maltreatment and psychopathology is compelling, there is a pressing need to understand how maltreatment increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that maltreatment alters trajectories of brain development to affect sensory systems, network architecture and circuits involved in threat detection, emotional regulation and reward anticipation. This Review explores whether these alterations reflect toxic effects of early-life stress or potentially adaptive modifications, the relationship between psychopathology and brain changes, and the distinction between resilience, susceptibility and compensation.", , , , , , ,DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.112 PMID: 27487814  [PubMed - in process], ,"Members of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) class have emerged as crucial regulators of nervous system development, with important implications for human health and disease. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of aGPCR functions during key steps in neural development, including cortical patterning, dendrite and synapse formation, and myelination. We focus on aGPCR modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signalling to control these varied aspects of neural development, and we discuss how impaired aGPCR function leads to neurological disease. We further highlight the emerging hypothesis that aGPCRs can be mechanically activated and the implications of this property in the nervous system.", , ,DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.103 PMID: 27466146  [PubMed - in process], , ,"Mossy cells comprise a large fraction of the cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, suggesting that their function in this region is important. They are vulnerable to ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and seizures, and their loss could contribute to dentate gyrus dysfunction in such conditions. Mossy cell function has been unclear because these cells innervate both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons within the dentate gyrus, contributing to a complex circuitry. It has also been difficult to directly and selectively manipulate mossy cells to study their function. In light of the new data generated using methods to preferentially eliminate or activate mossy cells in mice, it is timely to ask whether mossy cells have become any less enigmatic than they were in the past.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.102 PMID: 27466142  [PubMed - in process],"The main characteristic of alcohol use disorder is the consumption of large quantities of alcohol despite the negative consequences. The transition from the moderate use of alcohol to excessive, uncontrolled alcohol consumption results from neuroadaptations that cause aberrant motivational learning and memory processes. Here, we examine studies that have combined molecular and behavioural approaches in rodents to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that keep the social intake of alcohol in check, which we term 'stop pathways', and the neuroadaptations that underlie the transition from moderate to uncontrolled, excessive alcohol intake, which we term 'go pathways'. We also discuss post-transcriptional, genetic and epigenetic alterations that underlie both types of pathways.", ,"In the embryonic and adult brain, neural stem cells proliferate and give rise to neurons and glia through highly regulated processes. Epigenetic mechanisms - including DNA and histone modifications, as well as regulation by non-coding RNAs - have pivotal roles in different stages of neurogenesis. Aberrant epigenetic regulation also contributes to the pathogenesis of various brain disorders. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic regulation in neurogenesis and its dysregulation in brain disorders, including discussion of newly identified DNA cytosine modifications. We also briefly cover the emerging field of epitranscriptomics, which involves modifications of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs.","Research on the neural substrates of drug reward, withdrawal and relapse has yet to be translated into significant advances in the treatment of addiction. One potential reason is that this research has not captured a common feature of human addiction: progressive social exclusion and marginalization. We propose that research aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms that link these processes to drug seeking and drug taking would help to make addiction neuroscience research more clinically relevant.", , , , , , ,"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is activated in both acute and chronic pain. In this Review, we discuss increasing evidence from rodent studies that ACC activation contributes to chronic pain states and describe several forms of synaptic plasticity that may underlie this effect. In particular, one form of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the ACC, which is triggered by the activation of NMDA receptors and expressed by an increase in AMPA-receptor function, sustains the affective component of the pain state. Another form of LTP in the ACC, which is triggered by the activation of kainate receptors and expressed by an increase in glutamate release, may contribute to pain-related anxiety.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.78 PMID: 27277870  [PubMed - in process],"Data from clinical and preclinical studies indicate that immune dysregulation, specifically of inflammatory processes, is associated with symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and concomitant activation of brain-resident microglia can lead to depressive behavioural symptoms. Repeated exposure to psychological stress has a profound impact on peripheral immune responses and perturbs the function of brain microglia, which may contribute to neurobiological changes underlying MDD. Here, we review these findings and discuss ongoing studies examining neuroimmune mechanisms that influence neuronal activity as well as synaptic plasticity. Interventions targeting immune-related cellular and molecular pathways may benefit subsets of MDD patients with immune dysregulation.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.79 PMID: 27277866  [PubMed - in process],"The dopamine system is unique among the brain's modulatory systems in that it has discrete projections to specific brain regions involved in motor behaviour, cognition and emotion. Dopamine neurons exhibit several activity patterns - including tonic and phasic firing - that are determined by a combination of endogenous pacemaker conductances and regulation by multiple afferent systems. Emerging evidence suggests that disruptions in these regulatory systems may underlie the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression.","Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that ensures the lysosomal degradation of old, supernumerary or ectopic cytoplasmic entities. Most eukaryotic cells, including neurons, rely on proficient autophagic responses for the maintenance of homeostasis in response to stress. Accordingly, autophagy mediates neuroprotective effects following some forms of acute brain damage, including methamphetamine intoxication, spinal cord injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. In some other circumstances, however, the autophagic machinery precipitates a peculiar form of cell death (known as autosis) that contributes to the aetiology of other types of acute brain damage, such as neonatal asphyxia. Here, we dissect the context-specific impact of autophagy on non-infectious acute brain injury, emphasizing the possible therapeutic application of pharmacological activators and inhibitors of this catabolic process for neuroprotection.","The hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) both have important roles in cognitive processes such as learning, memory and decision making. Nevertheless, research on the OFC and hippocampus has proceeded largely independently, and little consideration has been given to the importance of interactions between these structures. Here, evidence is reviewed that the hippocampus and OFC encode parallel, but interactive, cognitive 'maps' that capture complex relationships between cues, actions, outcomes and other features of the environment. A better understanding of the interactions between the OFC and hippocampus is important for understanding the neural bases of flexible, goal-directed decision making.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.104 PMID: 27466149  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher],DOI: 10.1038/nrn.2016.105 PMID: 27466141  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher], , , , , , , , , , , ,"Somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons constitute a major class of inhibitory neurons in the mammalian cortex and are characterized by dense wiring into the local network and high basal firing activity that persists in the absence of synaptic input. This firing provides both GABA type A receptor (GABAAR)- and GABABR-mediated inhibition that operates at fast and slow timescales. The activity of somatostatin-expressing neurons is regulated by brain state, during learning and in rewarded behaviour. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how this class of cells can control network activity, with specific reference to how this is constrained by their anatomical and electrophysiological properties.", , ,"In this Opinion article, we discuss how integrated information theory accounts for several aspects of the relationship between consciousness and the brain. Integrated information theory starts from the essential properties of phenomenal experience, from which it derives the requirements for the physical substrate of consciousness. It argues that the physical substrate of consciousness must be a maximum of intrinsic cause-effect power and provides a means to determine, in principle, the quality and quantity of experience. The theory leads to some counterintuitive predictions and can be used to develop new tools for assessing consciousness in non-communicative patients.","Working memory - the ability to maintain and manipulate information over a period of seconds - is a core component of higher cognitive functions. The storage capacity of working memory is limited but can be expanded by training, and evidence of the neural mechanisms underlying this effect is accumulating. Human imaging studies and neurophysiological recordings in non-human primates, together with computational modelling studies, reveal that training increases the activity of prefrontal neurons and the strength of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and between the prefrontal and parietal cortex. Dopaminergic transmission could have a facilitatory role. These changes more generally inform us of the plasticity of higher cognitive functions.","The scarcity of live human brain cells for experimental access has for a long time limited our ability to study complex human neurological disorders and elucidate basic neuroscientific mechanisms. A decade ago, the development of methods to reprogramme somatic human cells into induced pluripotent stem cells enabled the in vitro generation of a wide range of neural cells from virtually any human individual. The growth of methods to generate more robust and defined neural cell types through reprogramming and direct conversion into induced neurons has led to the establishment of various human reprogramming-based neural disease models.","Increasing evidence points to a complex interplay between genes and the environment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including rare de novo mutations in chromatin genes such as methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) in Rett syndrome. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation act at this interface, reflecting the plasticity in metabolic and neurodevelopmentally regulated gene pathways. Genome-wide studies of gene sequences, gene pathways and DNA methylation are providing valuable mechanistic insights into ASD. The dynamic developmental landscape of DNA methylation is vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental insults: therefore, understanding pathways that are central to this 'perfect storm' will be crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.", , , , , ,"Humans and non-human primates share an elemental quantification system that resides in a dedicated neural network in the parietal and frontal lobes. In this cortical network, 'number neurons' encode the number of elements in a set, its cardinality or numerosity, irrespective of stimulus appearance across sensory motor systems, and from both spatial and temporal presentation arrays. After numbers have been extracted from sensory input, they need to be processed to support goal-directed behaviour. Studying number neurons provides insights into how information is maintained in working memory and transformed in tasks that require rule-based decisions. Beyond an understanding of how cardinal numbers are encoded, number processing provides a window into the neuronal mechanisms of high-level brain functions.", , , , , , ,"Although it is challenging for individuals with cocaine addiction to achieve abstinence, the greatest difficulty is avoiding relapse to drug taking, which is often triggered by cues associated with prior cocaine use. This vulnerability to relapse persists for long periods (months to years) after abstinence is achieved. Here, I discuss rodent studies of cue-induced cocaine craving during abstinence, with a focus on neuronal plasticity in the reward circuitry that maintains high levels of craving. Such work has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and to further our understanding of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult brain under normal circumstances and in the context of addiction.","A nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) within the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene was the first of this type of mutation to be linked to multiple neurological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The pathogenic mechanisms through which the C9orf72 NRE contributes to these disorders include loss of C9orf72 function and gain-of-function mechanisms of C9orf72 driven by toxic RNA and protein species encoded by the NRE. These mechanisms have been linked to several cellular defects - including nucleocytoplasmic trafficking deficits and nuclear stress - that have been observed in both patients and animal models.", , , ,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are assemblies of four core subunits, GluA1-4, that mediate most fast excitatory neurotransmission. The component subunits determine the functional properties of AMPARs, and the prevailing view is that the subunit composition also determines AMPAR trafficking, which is dynamically regulated during development, synaptic plasticity and in response to neuronal stress in disease. Recently, the subunit dependence of AMPAR trafficking has been questioned, leading to a reappraisal of this field. In this Review, we discuss what is known, uncertain, conjectured and unknown about the roles of the individual subunits, and how they affect AMPAR assembly, trafficking and function under both normal and pathological conditions.", ,"There have been a number of advances in the search for the neural correlates of consciousness--the minimum neural mechanisms sufficient for any one specific conscious percept. In this Review, we describe recent findings showing that the anatomical neural correlates of consciousness are primarily localized to a posterior cortical hot zone that includes sensory areas, rather than to a fronto-parietal network involved in task monitoring and reporting. We also discuss some candidate neurophysiological markers of consciousness that have proved illusory, and measures of differentiation and integration of neural activity that offer more promising quantitative indices of consciousness.","Alternative precursor-mRNA splicing is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in mammals and is controlled by specialized RNA-binding proteins. The misregulation of splicing is implicated in multiple neurological disorders. We describe recent mouse genetic studies of alternative splicing that reveal its critical role in both neuronal development and the function of mature neurons. We discuss the challenges in understanding the extensive genetic programmes controlled by proteins that regulate splicing, both during development and in the adult brain.", ,"Energy balance--that is, the relationship between energy intake and energy expenditure--is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones, brain circuits and peripheral tissues. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine that suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure. Ironically, obese individuals have high levels of plasma leptin and are resistant to leptin treatment. Neurotrophic factors, particularly ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are also important for the control of body weight. CNTF can overcome leptin resistance in order to reduce body weight, although CNTF and leptin activate similar signalling cascades. Mutations in the gene encoding BDNF lead to insatiable appetite and severe obesity.","In an increasing number of states and countries, cannabis now stands poised to join alcohol and tobacco as a legal drug. Quantifying the relative adverse and beneficial effects of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids should therefore be prioritized. Whereas newspaper headlines have focused on links between cannabis and psychosis, less attention has been paid to the much more common problem of cannabis addiction. Certain cognitive changes have also been attributed to cannabis use, although their causality and longevity are fiercely debated. Identifying why some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of cannabis is now of paramount importance to public health. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about such vulnerability factors, the variations in types of cannabis, and the relationship between these and cognition and addiction.","Language-processing functions follow heterogeneous developmental trajectories. The human embryo can already distinguish vowels in utero, but grammatical complexity is usually not fully mastered until at least 7 years of age. Examining the current literature, we propose that the ontogeny of the cortical language network can be roughly subdivided into two main developmental stages. In the first stage extending over the first 3 years of life, the infant rapidly acquires bottom-up processing capacities, which are primarily implemented bilaterally in the temporal cortices. In the second stage continuing into adolescence, top-down processes emerge gradually with the increasing functional selectivity and structural connectivity of the left inferior frontal cortex.", , , , ,"There has been an explosion in the number of papers discussing the hypothesis of 'pathogenic spread' in neurodegenerative disease - the idea that abnormal forms of disease-associated proteins, such as tau or α-synuclein, physically move from neuron to neuron to induce disease progression. However, whether inter-neuronal spread of protein aggregates actually occurs in humans and, if so, whether it causes symptom onset remain uncertain. Even if pathogenic spread is proven in humans, it is unclear how much this would alter the specific therapeutic approaches that are in development. A critical appraisal of this increasingly popular hypothesis thus seems both important and timely.","Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are a family of scaffold proteins that are highly enriched in synapses and are responsible for organizing the numerous protein complexes required for synaptic development and plasticity. Mutations in genes encoding MAGUKs and their interacting proteins can cause a broad spectrum of human psychiatric disorders. Here, we review MAGUK-mediated synaptic protein complex formation and regulation by focusing on findings from recent biochemical and structural investigations. These mechanistic-based studies show that the formation of MAGUK-organized complexes is often directly regulated by protein phosphorylation, suggesting a close connection between neuronal activity and the assembly of dynamic protein complexes in synapses.", ,"The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) shows three major types of rhythms: theta, sharp wave-ripples and gamma. These rhythms are defined by their frequencies, they have behavioural correlates in several species including rats and humans, and they have been proposed to carry out distinct functions in hippocampal memory processing. However, recent findings have challenged traditional views on these behavioural functions. In this Review, I discuss our current understanding of the origins and the mnemonic functions of hippocampal theta, sharp wave-ripples and gamma rhythms on the basis of findings from rodent studies. In addition, I present an updated synthesis of their roles and interactions within the hippocampal network.", , ,"Unravelling the functional operation of neuronal networks and linking cellular activity to specific behavioural outcomes are among the biggest challenges in neuroscience. In this broad field of research, substantial progress has been made in studies of the spinal networks that control locomotion. Through united efforts using electrophysiological and molecular genetic network approaches and behavioural studies in phylogenetically diverse experimental models, the organization of locomotor networks has begun to be decoded. The emergent themes from this research are that the locomotor networks have a modular organization with distinct transmitter and molecular codes and that their organization is reconfigured with changes to the speed of locomotion or changes in gait.","Genome-wide association studies have identified rare variants of the gene that encodes triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) - an immune receptor that is found in brain microglia - as risk factors for non-familial Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, animal studies have indicated that microglia have an important role in the brain response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and that TREM2 variants may have an impact on such a function. We discuss how TREM2 may control the microglial response to Aβ and its impact on microglial senescence, as well as the interaction of TREM2 with other molecules that are encoded by gene variants associated with AD and the hypothetical consequences of the cleavage of TREM2 from the cell surface.", , ,"Functional neural competence and integrity require interactive exchanges among sensory and motor neurons, interneurons and glial cells. Recent studies have attributed some of the tasks needed for these exchanges to extracellular vesicles (such as exosomes and microvesicles), which are most prominently involved in shuttling reciprocal signals between myelinating glia and neurons, thus promoting neuronal survival, the immune response mediated by microglia, and synapse assembly and plasticity. Such vesicles have also been identified as important factors in the spread of neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer. These extracellular vesicle functions add a previously unrecognized level of complexity to transcellular interactions within the nervous system.","When rats come to a decision point, they sometimes pause and look back and forth as if deliberating over the choice; at other times, they proceed as if they have already made their decision. In the 1930s, this pause-and-look behaviour was termed 'vicarious trial and error' (VTE), with the implication that the rat was 'thinking about the future'. The discovery in 2007 that the firing of hippocampal place cells gives rise to alternating representations of each of the potential path options in a serial manner during VTE suggested a possible neural mechanism that could underlie the representations of future outcomes. More-recent experiments examining VTE in rats suggest that there are direct parallels to human processes of deliberative decision making, working memory and mental time travel.","The brain creates a model of the world around us. We can use this representation to perceive and comprehend what we see at any given moment, but also to vividly re-experience scenes from our past and imagine future (or even fanciful) scenarios. Recent work has shown that these cognitive functions--perception, imagination and recall of scenes and events--all engage the anterior hippocampus. In this Opinion article, we capitalize on new findings from functional neuroimaging to propose a model that links high-level cognitive functions to specific structures within the anterior hippocampus.","Environmental stimuli and objects, including rewards, are often processed sequentially in the brain. Recent work suggests that the phasic dopamine reward prediction-error response follows a similar sequential pattern. An initial brief, unselective and highly sensitive increase in activity unspecifically detects a wide range of environmental stimuli, then quickly evolves into the main response component, which reflects subjective reward value and utility. This temporal evolution allows the dopamine reward prediction-error signal to optimally combine speed and accuracy.","The 'one neuron, one neurotransmitter' doctrine states that synaptic communication between two neurons occurs through the release of a single chemical transmitter. However, recent findings suggest that neurons that communicate using more than one classical neurotransmitter are prevalent throughout the adult mammalian CNS. In particular, several populations of neurons previously thought to release only glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine or histamine also release the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Here, we review these findings and discuss the implications of GABA co-release for synaptic transmission and plasticity.", , , , , ,"When it comes to fusion with the neuronal cell membrane, does a synaptic vesicle have a choice whether to stop or to go? Recent work suggests that complexin, a tiny protein found within the synaptic terminal, contributes to the mechanism through which this choice is made. How complexin plays this consulting part and which synaptic vesicle proteins it interacts with remain open questions. Indeed, studies in mice and flies have led to the proposal of different models of complexin function. We suggest that understanding the modular nature of complexin will help us to unpick its role in synaptic vesicle release.","Autoantibodies targeting proteins at the neuromuscular junction are known to cause several distinct myasthenic syndromes. Recently, autoantibodies targeting neurotransmitter receptors and associated proteins have also emerged as a cause of severe, but potentially treatable, diseases of the CNS. Here, we review the clinical evidence as well as in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence that autoantibodies account for myasthenic syndromes and autoimmune disorders of the CNS by disrupting the functional or structural integrity of synapses. Studying neurological and psychiatric diseases of autoimmune origin may provide new insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying a broad range of CNS disorders.","Hippocampal area CA2 has several features that distinguish it from CA1 and CA3, including a unique gene expression profile, failure to display long-term potentiation and relative resistance to cell death. A recent increase in interest in the CA2 region, combined with the development of new methods to define and manipulate its neurons, has led to some exciting new discoveries on the properties of CA2 neurons and their role in behaviour. Here, we review these findings and call attention to the idea that the definition of area CA2 ought to be revised in light of gene expression data.","For many types of learning, spaced training, which involves repeated long inter-trial intervals, leads to more robust memory formation than does massed training, which involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently have data begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced training, and we review these theories and data here. Computational models of the implicated signalling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular inter-trial intervals can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.", , ,"Molecular, genetic and pathological evidence suggests that deficits in GABAergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology through alterations in the brain's excitation-inhibition balance that result in impaired behaviour and cognition. Although the factors that trigger these deficits are diverse, there is increasing evidence that they converge on a common pathological hub that involves NMDA receptor hypofunction and oxidative stress. These factors have been separately linked to schizophrenia pathogenesis, but evidence now suggests that they are mechanistically interdependent and contribute to a common schizophrenia-associated pathology.", , , ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2016 Feb;17(2):118.,"The puzzle of how complex nervous systems emerged remains unsolved. Comparative studies of neurodevelopment in cnidarians and bilaterians suggest that this process began with distinct integration centres that evolved on opposite ends of an initial nerve net. The 'apical nervous system' controlled general body physiology, and the 'blastoporal nervous system' coordinated feeding movements and locomotion. We propose that expansion, integration and fusion of these centres gave rise to the bilaterian nerve cord and brain.", , ,"The molecular diversification of cell surface molecules has long been postulated to impart specific surface identities on neuronal cell types. The existence of unique cell surface identities would allow neurons to distinguish one another and connect with their appropriate target cells. Although progress has been made in identifying cell type-specific surface molecule repertoires and in characterizing their extracellular interactions, determining how this molecular diversity contributes to the precise wiring of neural circuitry has proven challenging. Here, we review the role of the cadherin, neurexin, immunoglobulin and leucine-rich repeat protein superfamilies in the specification of connectivity. The emerging evidence suggests that the concerted actions of these proteins may critically contribute to the assembly of neural circuits.","Genome-editing tools, and in particular those based on CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein) systems, are accelerating the pace of biological research and enabling targeted genetic interrogation in almost any organism and cell type. These tools have opened the door to the development of new model systems for studying the complexity of the nervous system, including animal models and stem cell-derived in vitro models. Precise and efficient gene editing using CRISPR-Cas systems has the potential to advance both basic and translational neuroscience research.", ,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that has a role in stabilizing neuronal microtubules and thus in promoting axonal outgrowth. Structurally, tau is a natively unfolded protein, is highly soluble and shows little tendency for aggregation. However, tau aggregation is characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. The mechanisms underlying tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration are debated, but considerable progress has been made in the field of tau research in recent years, including the identification of new physiological roles for tau in the brain. Here, we review the expression, post-translational modifications and functions of tau in physiology and in pathophysiology.",Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Apr;16(4):213-25. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2016 Jan;17(1):59.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2016 Jan;17(1):59., , ,"The synapse is the focus of experimental research and theory on the cellular mechanisms of nervous system plasticity and learning, but recent research is expanding the consideration of plasticity into new mechanisms beyond the synapse, notably including the possibility that conduction velocity could be modifiable through changes in myelin to optimize the timing of information transmission through neural circuits. This concept emerges from a confluence of brain imaging that reveals changes in white matter in the human brain during learning, together with cellular studies showing that the process of myelination can be influenced by action potential firing in axons. This Opinion article summarizes the new research on activity-dependent myelination, explores the possible implications of these studies and outlines the potential for new research.","The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a central integrator linking the perception of external and internal stimuli to distinct neurophysiological and behavioural outcomes (such as fear reaction, anxiety and stress-coping), thus allowing an organism to adapt to its changing environment. eCB signalling seems to determine the value of fear-evoking stimuli and to tune appropriate behavioural responses, which are essential for the organism's long-term viability, homeostasis and stress resilience; and dysregulation of eCB signalling can lead to psychiatric disorders. An understanding of the underlying neural cell populations and cellular processes enables the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate behavioural maladaptation.", , , ,"To identify and interact with moving objects, including other members of the same species, an animal's nervous system must correctly interpret patterns of contrast in the physical signals (such as light or sound) that it receives from the environment. In weakly electric fish, the motion of objects in the environment and social interactions with other fish create complex patterns of contrast in the electric fields that they produce and detect. These contrast patterns can extend widely over space and time and represent a multitude of relevant features, as is also true for other sensory systems. Mounting evidence suggests that the computational principles underlying contrast coding in electrosensory neural networks are conserved elements of spatiotemporal processing that show strong parallels with the vertebrate visual system.","Classically, the basal ganglia have been considered to have a role in producing habitual and goal-directed behaviours. In this article, we review recent evidence that expands this role, indicating that the basal ganglia are also involved in neural and behavioural inhibition in the motor and non-motor domains. We then distinguish between goal-directed and habitual (also known as automatic) inhibition mediated by fronto-striato-subthalamic-pallido-thalamo-cortical networks. We also suggest that imbalance between goal-directed and habitual action and inhibition contributes to some manifestations of Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, we propose that basal ganglia surgery improves these disorders by restoring a functional balance between facilitation and inhibition.", ,"Cortical circuits work through the generation of coordinated, large-scale activity patterns. In sensory systems, the onset of a discrete stimulus usually evokes a temporally organized packet of population activity lasting ∼50-200 ms. The structure of these packets is partially stereotypical, and variation in the exact timing and number of spikes within a packet conveys information about the identity of the stimulus. Similar packets also occur during ongoing stimuli and spontaneously. We suggest that such packets constitute the basic building blocks of cortical coding.", ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Dec;16(12):767.,Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Aug;16(8):487-97. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Dec;16(12):767.,"Emotions are powerful determinants of behaviour, thought and experience, and they may be regulated in various ways. Neuroimaging studies have implicated several brain regions in emotion regulation, including the ventral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, as well as the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Drawing on computational approaches to value-based decision-making and reinforcement learning, we propose a unifying conceptual framework for understanding the neural bases of diverse forms of emotion regulation.", ,"DNA damage is correlated with and may drive the ageing process. Neurons in the brain are postmitotic and are excluded from many forms of DNA repair; therefore, neurons are vulnerable to various neurodegenerative diseases. The challenges facing the field are to understand how and when neuronal DNA damage accumulates, how this loss of genomic integrity might serve as a 'time keeper' of nerve cell ageing and why this process manifests itself as different diseases in different individuals.","Clinical studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance (IR) and cognitive dysfunction, but there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Animal models of IR help to bridge these gaps and point to hippocampal IR as a potential mediator of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM, as well as in Alzheimer disease (AD). This Review highlights these observations and discusses intervention studies which suggest that the restoration of insulin activity in the hippocampus may be an effective strategy to alleviate the cognitive decline associated with T2DM and AD.", , ,"Cable theory and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Huxley-Katz models for the propagation of ions and voltage within a neuron have provided a theoretical foundation for electrophysiology and been responsible for many cornerstone advances in neuroscience. However, these theories break down when they are applied to small neuronal compartments, such as dendritic spines, synaptic terminals or small neuronal processes, because they assume spatial and ionic homogeneity. Here we discuss a broader theory that uses the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) approximation and electrodiffusion to more accurately model the constraints that neuronal nanostructures place on electrical current flow. This extension of traditional cable theory could advance our understanding of the physiology of neuronal nanocompartments.", , ,"Neural circuit function can be drastically affected by variations in the number of cells that are produced during development or by a reduction in adult cell number owing to disease. For this reason, unique cell cycle and cell growth control mechanisms operate in the developing and adult brain. In Drosophila melanogaster and in mammalian neural stem and progenitor cells, these mechanisms are intricately coordinated with the developmental age and the nutritional, metabolic and hormonal state of the animal. Defects in neural stem cell proliferation that result in the generation of incorrect cell numbers or defects in neural stem cell differentiation can cause microcephaly or megalencephaly.","Visual attention functions as a filter to select environmental information for learning and memory, making it the first step in the eventual cascade of thought and action systems. Here, we review studies of typical and atypical visual attention development and explain how they offer insights into the mechanisms of adult visual attention. We detail interactions between visual processing and visual attention, as well as the contribution of visual attention to memory. Finally, we discuss genetic mechanisms underlying attention disorders and how attention may be modified by training.", ,"Brain endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling influences the motivation for natural rewards (such as palatable food, sexual activity and social interaction) and modulates the rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Pathological forms of natural and drug-induced reward are associated with dysregulated eCB signalling that may derive from pre-existing genetic factors or from prolonged drug exposure. Impaired eCB signalling contributes to dysregulated synaptic plasticity, increased stress responsivity, negative emotional states and cravings that propel addiction. Understanding the contributions of eCB disruptions to behavioural and physiological traits provides insight into the eCB influence on addiction vulnerability.","Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognition, which manifests as difficulties in identifying emotions, feeing connected to others, inferring people's thoughts and reacting emotionally to others. These social cognitive impairments interfere with social connections and are strong determinants of the degree of impaired daily functioning in such individuals. Here, we review recent findings from the fields of social cognition and social neuroscience and identify the social processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. We also consider empathy as an example of a complex social cognitive function that integrates several social processes and is impaired in schizophrenia. This information may guide interventions to improve social cognition in patients with this disorder.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Nov;16(11):700., , ,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most-frequently inherited form of intellectual disability and the most-prevalent single-gene cause of autism, results from a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that acts, in most cases, to repress translation. Multiple pharmacological and genetic manipulations that target receptors, scaffolding proteins, kinases and translational control proteins can rescue neuronal morphology, synaptic function and behavioural phenotypes in FXS model mice, presumably by reducing excessive neuronal translation to normal levels. Such rescue strategies might also be explored in the future to identify the mRNAs that are critical for FXS pathophysiology.",Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Jun;16(6):317-31., , ,"Genetics studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified several risk genes that are key regulators of synaptic plasticity. Indeed, many of the risk genes that have been linked to these disorders encode synaptic scaffolding proteins, receptors, cell adhesion molecules or proteins that are involved in chromatin remodelling, transcription, protein synthesis or degradation, or actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Changes in any of these proteins can increase or decrease synaptic strength or number and, ultimately, neuronal connectivity in the brain. In addition, when deleterious mutations occur, inefficient genetic buffering and impaired synaptic homeostasis may increase an individual's risk for ASD.","Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is associated with persistent psychosocial disability in affected individuals. Although studies of schizophrenia have traditionally focused on deficits in higher-order processes such as working memory and executive function, there is an increasing realization that, in this disorder, deficits can be found throughout the cortex and are manifest even at the level of early sensory processing. These deficits are highly amenable to translational investigation and represent potential novel targets for clinical intervention. Deficits, moreover, have been linked to specific structural abnormalities in post-mortem auditory cortex tissue from individuals with schizophrenia, providing unique insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.","Many attempts have been made to localize the physical trace of a memory, or engram, in the brain. However, until recently, engrams have remained largely elusive. In this Review, we develop four defining criteria that enable us to critically assess the recent progress that has been made towards finding the engram. Recent 'capture' studies use novel approaches to tag populations of neurons that are active during memory encoding, thereby allowing these engram-associated neurons to be manipulated at later times. We propose that findings from these capture studies represent considerable progress in allowing us to observe, erase and express the engram.", , ,"The voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.9 is preferentially expressed in nociceptors and has been shown in rodent models to have a major role in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These studies suggest that by selectively targeting Na(V)1.9, it might be possible to ameliorate pain without inducing adverse CNS side effects such as sedation, confusion and addictive potential. Three recent studies in humans--two genetic and functional studies in rare genetic disorders, and a third study showing a role for Na(V)1.9 in painful peripheral neuropathy--have demonstrated that Na(V)1.9 plays an important part both in regulating sensory neuron excitability and in pain signalling. With this human validation, attention is turning to this channel as a potential therapeutic target for pain.","Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)--an Alzheimer disease risk factor--although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.", , , ,"Increasing evidence points to a central role for immune dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several ASD risk genes encode components of the immune system and many maternal immune system-related risk factors--including autoimmunity, infection and fetal reactive antibodies--are associated with ASD. In addition, there is evidence of ongoing immune dysregulation in individuals with ASD and in animal models of this disorder. Recently, several molecular signalling pathways--including pathways downstream of cytokines, the receptor MET, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, microglia and complement factors--have been identified that link immune activation to ASD phenotypes. Together, these findings indicate that the immune system is a point of convergence for multiple ASD-related genetic and environmental risk factors.","Recent research into local-circuit GABAergic inhibitory interneurons of the mammalian central nervous system has provided unprecedented insight into the mechanics of neuronal circuitry and its dysfunction. Inhibitory interneurons consist of a broad array of anatomically and neurochemically diverse cell types, and this suggests that each occupies an equally diverse functional role. Although neurogliaform cells were observed by Cajal over a century ago, our understanding of the functional role of this class of interneurons is in its infancy. However, it is rapidly becoming clear that this cell type operates under a distinct repertoire of rules to provide novel forms of inhibitory control of numerous afferent pathways.", , ,"The choroid plexus (ChP) is the principal source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which has accepted roles as a fluid cushion and a sink for nervous system waste in vertebrates. Various animal models have provided insights into how the ChP-CSF system develops and matures. In addition, recent studies have uncovered new, active roles for this dynamic system in the regulation of neural stem cells, critical periods and the overall health of the nervous system. Together, these findings have brought about a paradigm shift in our understanding of brain development and health, and have stimulated new initiatives for the treatment of neurological disease.", ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Dec;16(12):767. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Dec;16(12):767.,"Birth is associated with a neuroprotective, oxytocin-mediated abrupt excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA shift that is abolished in autism, and its restoration attenuates the disorder in offspring. In this Opinion article, I discuss the links between birth-related stressful mechanisms, persistent excitatory GABA actions, perturbed network oscillations and autism. I propose that birth (parturition) is a critical period that confirms, attenuates or aggravates the deleterious effects of intrauterine genetic or environmental insults.", , ,"Placebo effects are beneficial effects that are attributable to the brain-mind responses to the context in which a treatment is delivered rather than to the specific actions of the drug. They are mediated by diverse processes--including learning, expectations and social cognition--and can influence various clinical and physiological outcomes related to health. Emerging neuroscience evidence implicates multiple brain systems and neurochemical mediators, including opioids and dopamine. We present an empirical review of the brain systems that are involved in placebo effects, focusing on placebo analgesia, and a conceptual framework linking these findings to the mind-brain processes that mediate them. This framework suggests that the neuropsychological processes that mediate placebo effects may be crucial for a wide array of therapeutic approaches, including many drugs.","Nociceptors and immune cells both protect the host from potential threats to homeostasis. There is growing evidence for bidirectional signalling between these two systems, and the underlying mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. An understanding is emerging of how both the adaptive and innate immune systems can activate and sensitize nociceptors, and, reciprocally, how nociceptors modulate immune cells. In this Review, we discuss how these interactions can be adaptive and useful to the organism but also consider when such signalling might be maladaptive and pathophysiological, contributing to immune-mediated diseases and persistent pain states.","Stress necessitates an immediate engagement of multiple neural and endocrine systems. However, exposure to a single stressor causes adaptive changes that modify responses to subsequent stressors. Recent studies examining synapses onto neuroendocrine cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus demonstrate that stressful experiences leave indelible marks that alter the ability of these synapses to undergo plasticity. These adaptations include a unique form of metaplasticity at glutamatergic synapses, bidirectional changes in endocannabinoid signalling and bidirectional changes in strength at GABAergic synapses that rely on distinct temporal windows following stress. This rich repertoire of plasticity is likely to represent an important building block for dynamic, experience-dependent modulation of neuroendocrine stress adaptation.", ,"The brain regulates information flow by balancing the segregation and integration of incoming stimuli to facilitate flexible cognition and behaviour. The topological features of brain networks--in particular, network communities and hubs--support this segregation and integration but do not provide information about how external inputs are processed dynamically (that is, over time). Experiments in which the consequences of selective inputs on brain activity are controlled and traced with great precision could provide such information. However, such strategies have thus far had limited success. By contrast, recent whole-brain computational modelling approaches have enabled us to start assessing the effect of input perturbations on brain dynamics in silico.",Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Apr;16(4):213-25., , ,"Intuition suggests that perception follows sensation and therefore bodily feelings originate in the body. However, recent evidence goes against this logic: interoceptive experience may largely reflect limbic predictions about the expected state of the body that are constrained by ascending visceral sensations. In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a common vulnerability for mental and physical illness.", , ,"The past two decades of research into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) have been driven largely by the amyloid hypothesis; the neuroinflammation that is associated with AD has been assumed to be merely a response to pathophysiological events. However, new data from preclinical and clinical studies have established that immune system-mediated actions in fact contribute to and drive AD pathogenesis. These insights have suggested both novel and well-defined potential therapeutic targets for AD, including microglia and several cytokines. In addition, as inflammation in AD primarily concerns the innate immune system - unlike in 'typical' neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and encephalitides - the concept of neuroinflammation in AD may need refinement.","Most neurodegenerative diseases that afflict humans are associated with the intracytoplasmic deposition of aggregate-prone proteins in neurons and with mitochondrial dysfunction. Autophagy is a powerful process for removing such proteins and for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Over recent years, evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that upregulation of autophagy may protect against neurodegeneration. However, autophagy dysfunction has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. This Review summarizes the progress that has been made in our understanding of how perturbations in autophagy are linked with neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic strategies resulting from the modulation of this process.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Jul;16(7):439., , , , , ,"Neurodevelopmental programming - the implementation of the genetic and epigenetic blueprints that guide and coordinate normal brain development - requires tight regulation of transcriptional processes. During prenatal and postnatal time periods, epigenetic processes fine-tune neurodevelopment towards an end product that determines how an organism interacts with and responds to exposures and experiences throughout life. Epigenetic processes also have the ability to reprogramme the epigenome in response to environmental challenges, such as maternal stress, making the organism more or less adaptive depending on the future challenges presented. Epigenetic marks generated within germ cells as a result of environmental influences throughout life can also shape future generations long before conception occurs.", ,"Stress often affects our social lives. When undergoing high-level or persistent stress, individuals frequently retract from social interactions and become irritable and hostile. Predisposition to antisocial behaviours - including social detachment and violence - is also modulated by early life adversity; however, the effects of early life stress depend on the timing of exposure and genetic factors. Research in animals and humans has revealed some of the structural, functional and molecular changes in the brain that underlie the effects of stress on social behaviour. Findings in this emerging field will have implications both for the clinic and for society.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Jun;16(6):372.,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Jun;16(6):372.,"For several decades, addiction has come to be viewed as a disorder of the dopamine neurotransmitter system; however, this view has not led to new treatments. In this Opinion article, we review the origins of the dopamine theory of addiction and discuss the ability of addictive drugs to elicit the release of dopamine in the human striatum. There is robust evidence that stimulants increase striatal dopamine levels and some evidence that alcohol may have such an effect, but little evidence, if any, that cannabis and opiates increase dopamine levels. Moreover, there is good evidence that striatal dopamine receptor availability and dopamine release are diminished in individuals with stimulant or alcohol dependence but not in individuals with opiate, nicotine or cannabis dependence. These observations have implications for understanding reward and treatment responses in various addictions.","As the global population ages, older decision makers will be required to take greater responsibility for their own physical, psychological and financial well-being. With this in mind, researchers have begun to examine the effects of ageing on decision making and associated neural circuits. A new 'affect-integration-motivation' (AIM) framework may help to clarify how affective and motivational circuits support decision making. Recent research has shed light on whether and how ageing influences these circuits, providing an interdisciplinary account of how ageing can alter decision making.", , , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Apr;16(4):225.,Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Jan;16(1):43-54.

Furthermore, animal studies have shown that manipulating the levels of particular miRNAs in the brain can alter behaviour. Here, we review recent studies in humans, animal models, cellular systems and bioinformatics that have advanced our understanding of the contribution of brain miRNAs to the regulation of behaviour in the context of psychiatric conditions. These studies highlight the potential of miRNA levels to be used in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and suggest that brain miRNAs could become novel treatment targets for psychiatric disorders.","Coping with stress is fundamental for mental health, but understanding of the molecular neurobiology of stress is still in its infancy. Adult neurogenesis is well known to be regulated by stress, and conversely adult neurogenesis regulates stress responses. Recent studies in neurogenic cells indicate that molecular pathways activated by glucocorticoids, the main stress hormones, are modulated by crosstalk with other stress-relevant mechanisms, including inflammatory mediators, neurotrophic factors and morphogen signalling pathways. This Review discusses the pathways that are involved in this crosstalk and thus regulate this complex relationship between adult neurogenesis and stress.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2016 Jan;17(1):59.

By reviewing studies of illiterate subjects, we propose specific hypotheses on how the functions of core brain systems are partially reoriented or 'recycled' when learning to read. Literacy acquisition improves early visual processing and reorganizes the ventral occipito-temporal pathway: responses to written characters are increased in the left occipito-temporal sulcus, whereas responses to faces shift towards the right hemisphere. Literacy also modifies phonological coding and strengthens the functional and anatomical link between phonemic and graphemic representations. Literacy acquisition therefore provides a remarkable example of how the brain reorganizes to accommodate a novel cultural skill.","Astrocytes seem to rely on relatively sluggish and spatially blurred Ca(2+) waves to communicate with fast and point-precise neural circuits. This apparent discrepancy could, however, reflect our current inability to understand the microscopic mechanisms involved. Difficulties in detecting and interpreting astrocyte Ca(2+) signals may have led to some prominent controversies in the field. Here, we argue that a deeper understanding of astrocyte physiology requires a qualitative leap in our experimental and analytical strategies.", , , , , ,"Exposure to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, leads to plastic changes in the activity of brain circuits, and a prevailing view is that these changes play a part in drug addiction. Notably, there has been intense focus on drug-induced changes in synaptic excitability and much less attention on intrinsic excitability factors (that is, excitability factors that are remote from the synapse). Accumulating evidence now suggests that intrinsic factors such as K+ channels are not only altered by cocaine but may also contribute to the shaping of the addiction phenotype.","Pathological perturbations of the brain are rarely confined to a single locus; instead, they often spread via axonal pathways to influence other regions. Patterns of such disease propagation are constrained by the extraordinarily complex, yet highly organized, topology of the underlying neural architecture; the so-called connectome. Thus, network organization fundamentally influences brain disease, and a connectomic approach grounded in network science is integral to understanding neuropathology. Here, we consider how brain-network topology shapes neural responses to damage, highlighting key maladaptive processes (such as diaschisis, transneuronal degeneration and dedifferentiation), and the resources (including degeneracy and reserve) and processes (such as compensation) that enable adaptation. We then show how knowledge of network topology allows us not only to describe pathological processes but also to generate predictive models of the spread and functional consequences of brain disease.","Multiple sclerosis is characterized at the gross pathological level by the presence of widespread focal demyelinating lesions of the myelin-rich white matter. However, it is becoming clear that grey matter is not spared, even during the earliest phases of the disease. Furthermore, grey matter damage may have an important role both in physical and cognitive disability. Grey matter pathology involves both inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, but the relationship between the two is unclear. Histological, immunological and neuroimaging studies have provided new insight in this rapidly expanding field, and form the basis of the most recent hypotheses on the pathogenesis of grey matter damage.","Subplate neurons have an essential role in cortical circuit formation. They are among the earliest formed neurons of the cerebral cortex, are located at the junction of white and grey matter, and are necessary for correct thalamocortical axon ingrowth. Recent transcriptomic studies have provided opportunities for monitoring and modulating selected subpopulations of these cells. Analyses of mouse lines expressing reporter genes have demonstrated novel, extracortical subplate neurogenesis and have shown how subplate cells are integrated under the influence of sensory activity into cortical and extracortical circuits. Recent studies have revealed that the subplate is involved in neurosecretion and modification of the extracellular milieu.", , ,"Retromer is a protein assembly that has a central role in endosomal trafficking, and retromer dysfunction has been linked to a growing number of neurological disorders. First linked to Alzheimer disease, retromer dysfunction causes a range of pathophysiological consequences that have been shown to contribute to the core pathological features of the disease. Genetic studies have established that retromer dysfunction is also pathogenically linked to Parkinson disease, although the biological mechanisms that mediate this link are only now being elucidated. Most recently, studies have shown that retromer is a tractable target in drug discovery for these and other disorders of the nervous system.", , , , , ,"Spatial orientation and navigation rely on the acquisition of several types of sensory information. This information is then transformed into a neural code for space in the hippocampal formation through the activity of place cells, grid cells and head-direction cells. These spatial representations, in turn, are thought to guide long-range navigation. But how the representations encoded by these different cell types are integrated in the brain to form a neural 'map and compass' is largely unknown. Here, we discuss this problem in the context of spatial navigation by bats and rats. We review the experimental findings and theoretical models that provide insight into the mechanisms that link sensory systems to spatial representations and to large-scale natural navigation.","The adult mammalian cerebellar cortex is generally assumed to have a uniform cytoarchitecture. Differences in cerebellar function are thought to arise primarily through distinct patterns of input and output connectivity rather than as a result of variations in cortical microcircuitry. However, evidence from anatomical, physiological and genetic studies is increasingly challenging this orthodoxy, and there are now various lines of evidence indicating that the cerebellar cortex is not uniform. Here, we develop the hypothesis that regional differences in properties of cerebellar cortical microcircuits lead to important differences in information processing.", , , , ,"The progression of many neurodegenerative diseases is thought to be driven by the template-directed misfolding, seeded aggregation and cell-cell transmission of characteristic disease-related proteins, leading to the sequential dissemination of pathological protein aggregates. Recent evidence strongly suggests that the anatomical connections made by neurons - in addition to the intrinsic characteristics of neurons, such as morphology and gene expression profile - determine whether they are vulnerable to degeneration in these disorders. Notably, this common pathogenic principle opens up opportunities for pursuing novel targets for therapeutic interventions for these neurodegenerative disorders. We review recent evidence that supports the notion of neuron-neuron protein propagation, with a focus on neuropathological and positron emission tomography imaging studies in humans.","Chemokines and opioids are important regulators of immune, inflammatory and neuronal responses in peripheral and central pain pathways. Recent studies have provided insights into the functional interactions between chemokine receptors and opioid receptors, and their role in pain modulation. In this Progress article, we discuss how crosstalk between these two systems might provide a molecular and cellular framework for the development of novel analgesic therapies for the management of acute and/or chronic pain.", , , ,"Ageing is characterized by the progressive impairment of physiological functions and increased risk of developing debilitating disorders, including chronic inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. These disorders have common molecular mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. In the wake of the approval of the first cannabinoid-based drug for the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis, we examine how endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling controls--and is affected by--normal ageing and neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose a conceptual framework linking eCB signalling to the control of the cellular and molecular hallmarks of these processes, and categorize the key components of endocannabinoid signalling that may serve as targets for novel therapeutics.","Fast synaptic communication in the brain requires synchronous vesicle fusion that is evoked by action potential-induced Ca(2+) influx. However, synaptic terminals also release neurotransmitters by spontaneous vesicle fusion, which is independent of presynaptic action potentials. A functional role for spontaneous neurotransmitter release events in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, as well as the regulation of certain behaviours, has been reported. In addition, there is evidence that the presynaptic mechanisms underlying spontaneous release of neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic targets are segregated from those of evoked neurotransmission. These findings challenge current assumptions about neuronal signalling and neurotransmission, as they indicate that spontaneous neurotransmission has an autonomous role in interneuronal communication that is distinct from that of evoked release.", , , , , , ,"Hormones regulate homeostasis by communicating through the bloodstream to the body's organs, including the brain. As homeostatic regulators of brain function, some hormones exert neuroprotective actions. This is the case for the ovarian hormone 17β-oestradiol, which signals through oestrogen receptors (ERs) that are widely distributed in the male and female brain. Recent discoveries have shown that oestradiol is not only a reproductive hormone but also a brain-derived neuroprotective factor in males and females and that ERs coordinate multiple signalling mechanisms that protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases, affective disorders and cognitive decline.","The brain is constantly bombarded by stimuli, and the relative salience of these inputs determines which are more likely to capture attention. A brain system known as the 'salience network', with key nodes in the insular cortices, has a central role in the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli and the coordination of neural resources. Emerging evidence suggests that atypical engagement of specific subdivisions of the insula within the salience network is a feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Apr;16(4):225. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Apr;16(4):225.,"Among the many signalling lipids, endocannabinoids are increasingly recognized for their important roles in neuronal and glial development. Recent experimental evidence suggests that, during neuronal differentiation, endocannabinoid signalling undergoes a fundamental switch from the prenatal determination of cell fate to the homeostatic regulation of synaptic neurotransmission and bioenergetics in the mature nervous system. These studies also offer novel insights into neuropsychiatric disease mechanisms and contribute to the public debate about the benefits and the risks of cannabis use during pregnancy and in adolescence.", , ,"The brain is highly enriched with fatty acids. These include the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which are largely esterified to the phospholipid cell membrane. Once PUFAs are released from the membrane, they can participate in signal transduction, either directly or after enzymatic conversion to a variety of bioactive derivatives ('mediators'). PUFAs and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission, cell survival and neuroinflammation, and thereby mood and cognition. PUFA levels and the signalling pathways that they regulate are altered in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression. Diet and drugs targeting PUFAs may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of brain disorders.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2015 Mar;16(3):184., , , , ,"Suicide ranks among the leading causes of death around the world and takes a heavy emotional and public health toll on most societies. Both distal and proximal factors contribute to suicidal behaviour. Distal factors - such as familial and genetic predisposition, as well as early-life adversity - increase the lifetime risk of suicide. They alter responses to stress and other processes through epigenetic modification of genes and associated changes in gene expression, and through the regulation of emotional and behavioural traits. Proximal factors are associated with the precipitation of a suicidal event and include alterations in key neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory changes and glial dysfunction in the brain. This Review explores the key molecular changes that are associated with suicidality and discusses some promising avenues for future research.","For several decades, myths about the brain - neuromyths - have persisted in schools and colleges, often being used to justify ineffective approaches to teaching. Many of these myths are biased distortions of scientific fact. Cultural conditions, such as differences in terminology and language, have contributed to a 'gap' between neuroscience and education that has shielded these distortions from scrutiny. In recent years, scientific communications across this gap have increased, although the messages are often distorted by the same conditions and biases as those responsible for neuromyths. In the future, the establishment of a new field of inquiry that is dedicated to bridging neuroscience and education may help to inform and to improve these communications.", , ,"Isolation and structure elucidation of most of the major cannabinoid constituents--including Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), which is the principal psychoactive molecule in Cannabis sativa--was achieved in the 1960s and 1970s. It was followed by the identification of two cannabinoid receptors in the 1980s and the early 1990s and by the identification of the endocannabinoids shortly thereafter. There have since been considerable advances in our understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its function in the brain, which reveal potential therapeutic targets for a wide range of brain disorders.", ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Dec;15(12):816.,"Wakefulness and vigilance levels are required for maintaining purposeful activities and motivated behaviours, which are often triggered by sensory information conveying external cues. An increasing body of work has suggested that orexins (also known as hypocretins)--a pair of neuropeptides that are crucial for maintaining wakefulness - are also involved in the regulation of motivated behaviours, including feeding, emotional behaviour and reward seeking, and that these functions are mediated by two subtypes of orexin receptors. Autonomic and endocrine responses, which accompany these motivated behaviours, are also influenced by the orexin system. Orexin-producing neurons act as a hub that links information about the internal and external environments of an animal to vigilance levels and internal bodily functions to support various motivated behaviours.", ,"Recent studies have revealed the existence of hippocampal neurons that fire at successive moments in temporally structured experiences. Several studies have shown that such temporal coding is not attributable to external events, specific behaviours or spatial dimensions of an experience. Instead, these cells represent the flow of time in specific memories and have therefore been dubbed 'time cells'. The firing properties of time cells parallel those of hippocampal place cells; time cells thus provide an additional dimension that is integrated with spatial mapping. The robust representation of both time and space in the hippocampus suggests a fundamental mechanism for organizing the elements of experience into coherent memories.", , , , , , ,"The precise functional role of the hippocampus remains a topic of much debate. The dominant view is that the dorsal (or posterior) hippocampus is implicated in memory and spatial navigation and the ventral (or anterior) hippocampus mediates anxiety-related behaviours. However, this 'dichotomy view' may need revision. Gene expression studies demonstrate multiple functional domains along the hippocampal long axis, which often exhibit sharply demarcated borders. By contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are superimposed on discrete functional domains. This model provides a potential framework to explain and test the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus.","Electrical activity in neurons requires a seamless functional coupling between plasmalemmal ion channels and ion transporters. Although ion channels have been studied intensively for several decades, research on ion transporters is in its infancy. In recent years, it has become evident that one family of ion transporters, cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), and in particular K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter 2 (KCC2), have seminal roles in shaping GABAergic signalling and neuronal connectivity. Studying the functions of these transporters may lead to major paradigm shifts in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain development and plasticity in health and disease.", , , , , ,"Modern network science has revealed fundamental aspects of normal brain-network organization, such as small-world and scale-free patterns, hierarchical modularity, hubs and rich clubs. The next challenge is to use this knowledge to gain a better understanding of brain disease. Recent developments in the application of network science to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy have challenged the classical concept of neurological disorders being either 'local' or 'global', and have pointed to the overload and failure of hubs as a possible final common pathway in neurological disorders.","Despite global increases in diversity, social prejudices continue to fuel intergroup conflict, disparities and discrimination. Moreover, as norms have become more egalitarian, prejudices seem to have 'gone underground', operating covertly and often unconsciously, such that they are difficult to detect and control. Neuroscientists have recently begun to probe the neural basis of prejudice and stereotyping in an effort to identify the processes through which these biases form, influence behaviour and are regulated. This research aims to elucidate basic mechanisms of the social brain while advancing our understanding of intergroup bias in social behaviour.", , , , ,"Neuronal circuits are defined by synaptic connections between their cellular constituents. In this article, I highlight several recent studies emphasizing the surprising level of precision exhibited by inhibitory GABAergic synapses within the neocortex and hippocampus. Specifically, GABAergic inputs to dendritic shafts and spines of pyramidal cells have a key role in the localized regulation of neuronal Ca(2+) signalling. These findings provide important new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying the contributions of inhibitory transmission to both normal and abnormal brain activity.","Understanding how the brain controls behaviour is undisputedly one of the grand goals of neuroscience research, and the pursuit of this goal has a long tradition in insect neuroscience. However, appropriate techniques were lacking for a long time. Recent advances in genetic and recording techniques now allow the participation of identified neurons in the execution of specific behaviours to be interrogated. By focusing on fly visual course control, I highlight what has been learned about the neuronal circuit modules that control visual guidance in Drosophila melanogaster through the use of these techniques.", ,"Lineage studies conducted in the retina more than 25 years ago demonstrated the multipotency of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). The number and types of cells produced by individual RPCs, even from a single time point in development, were found to be highly variable. This raised the question of whether this variability was due to intrinsic differences among RPCs or to extrinsic and/or stochastic effects on equivalent RPCs or their progeny. Newer lineage studies that have made use of molecular markers of RPCs, retrovirus-mediated lineage analyses of specific RPCs and live imaging have begun to provide answers to this question. RPCs that produce two postmitotic daughter cells - that is, terminally dividing RPCs - have been the most well characterized RPCs to date, and have been shown to produce specific types of daughter cells. In addition, recent studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms that drive the temporal order in which retinal cells are born.","Uniquely among human senses, hearing is not simply a passive response to stimulation. Our auditory system is instead enhanced by an active process in cochlear hair cells that amplifies acoustic signals several hundred-fold, sharpens frequency selectivity and broadens the ear's dynamic range. Active motility of the mechanoreceptive hair bundles underlies the active process in amphibians and some reptiles; in mammals, this mechanism operates in conjunction with prestin-based somatic motility. Both individual hair bundles and the cochlea as a whole operate near a dynamical instability, the Hopf bifurcation, which accounts for the cardinal features of the active process.", ,"Our ability to perceive temperature is crucial: it enables us to swiftly react to noxiously cold or hot objects and helps us to maintain a constant body temperature. Sensory nerve endings, upon depolarization by temperature-gated ion channels, convey electrical signals from the periphery to the CNS, eliciting a sense of temperature. In the past two decades, we have witnessed important advances in our understanding of mammalian thermosensation, with the identification and animal-model assessment of candidate molecular thermosensors - such as types of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels - involved in peripheral thermosensation. Ongoing research aims to understand how these miniature thermometers operate at the cellular and molecular level, and how they can be pharmacologically targeted to treat pain without disturbing vital thermoregulatory processes.", , ,"Mobile elements are DNA sequences that can change their position (retrotranspose) within the genome. Although its biological function is largely unappreciated, DNA derived from mobile elements comprises nearly half of the human genome. It has long been thought that neuronal genomes are invariable; however, recent studies have demonstrated that mobile elements actively retrotranspose during neurogenesis, thereby creating genomic diversity between neurons. In addition, mounting data demonstrate that mobile elements are misregulated in certain neurological disorders, including Rett syndrome and schizophrenia.", ,"How does our brain choose the best course of action? Choices between material goods are thought to be steered by neural value signals that encode the rewarding properties of the choice options. Social decisions, by contrast, are traditionally thought to rely on neural representations of the self and others. However, recent studies show that many types of social decisions may also involve neural value computations. This suggests a unified mechanism for motivational control of behaviour that may incorporate both social and non-social factors. In this Review, we outline a theoretical framework that may help to identify possible overlaps and differences between the neural processes that guide social and non-social decision making.","Visual categorization is thought to occur in the human ventral temporal cortex (VTC), but how this categorization is achieved is still largely unknown. In this Review, we consider the computations and representations that are necessary for categorization and examine how the microanatomical and macroanatomical layout of the VTC might optimize them to achieve rapid and flexible visual categorization. We propose that efficient categorization is achieved by organizing representations in a nested spatial hierarchy in the VTC. This spatial hierarchy serves as a neural infrastructure for the representational hierarchy of visual information in the VTC and thereby enables flexible access to category information at several levels of abstraction.","People are increasingly being exposed to environmental noise from traffic, media and other sources that falls within and outside legal limits. Although such environmental noise is known to cause stress in the auditory system, it is still generally considered to be harmless. This complacency may be misplaced: even in the absence of cochlear damage, new findings suggest that environmental noise may progressively degrade hearing through alterations in the way sound is represented in the adult auditory cortex.","Malignant gliomas are devastating tumours that frequently kill patients within 1 year of diagnosis. The major obstacle to a cure is diffuse invasion, which enables tumours to escape complete surgical resection and chemo- and radiation therapy. Gliomas use the same tortuous extracellular routes of migration that are travelled by immature neurons and stem cells, frequently using blood vessels as guides. They repurpose ion channels to dynamically adjust their cell volume to accommodate to narrow spaces and breach the blood-brain barrier through disruption of astrocytic endfeet, which envelop blood vessels. The unique biology of glioma invasion provides hitherto unexplored brain-specific therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.", , ,"Light has profoundly influenced the evolution of life on earth. As widely appreciated, light enables us to generate images of our environment. However, light - through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) - also influences behaviours that are essential for our health and quality of life but are independent of image formation. These include the synchronization of the circadian clock to the solar day, tracking of seasonal changes and the regulation of sleep. Irregular light environments lead to problems in circadian rhythms and sleep, which eventually cause mood and learning deficits. Recently, it was found that irregular light can also directly affect mood and learning without producing major disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep. In this Review, we discuss the indirect and direct influence of light on mood and learning, and provide a model for how light, the circadian clock and sleep interact to influence mood and cognitive functions.", ,"One of the grand challenges in neuroscience is to comprehend neural computation in the association cortices, the parts of the cortex that have shown the largest expansion and differentiation during mammalian evolution and that are thought to contribute profoundly to the emergence of advanced cognition in humans. In this Review, we use grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex as a gateway to understand network computation at a stage of cortical processing in which firing patterns are shaped not primarily by incoming sensory signals but to a large extent by the intrinsic properties of the local circuit.","Müller glia are the major glial component of the retina. They are one of the last retinal cell types to be born during development, and they function to maintain retinal homeostasis and integrity. In mammals, Müller glia respond to retinal injury in various ways that can be either protective or detrimental to retinal function. Although these cells can be coaxed to proliferate and generate neurons under special circumstances, these responses are meagre and insufficient for repairing a damaged retina. By contrast, in teleost fish (such as zebrafish), the response of Müller glia to retinal injury involves a reprogramming event that imparts retinal stem cell characteristics and enables them to produce a proliferating population of progenitors that can regenerate all major retinal cell types and restore vision. Recent studies have revealed several important mechanisms underlying Müller glial cell reprogramming and retina regeneration in fish that may lead to new strategies for stimulating retina regeneration in mammals.", , , ,"Punctuated episodes of spreading depolarizations erupt in the brain, encumbering tissue structure and function, and raising fascinating unanswered questions concerning their initiation and propagation. Linked to migraine aura and headache, cortical spreading depression contributes to the morbidity in the world's migraine with aura population. Even more ominously, erupting spreading depolarizations accelerate tissue damage during brain injury. The once-held view that spreading depolarizations may not exist in the human brain has changed, largely because of the discovery of migraine genes that confer cortical spreading depression susceptibility, the application of sophisticated imaging tools and efforts to interrogate their impact in the acutely injured human brain.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviours that are experienced as unwanted. Family and twin studies have demonstrated that OCD is a multifactorial familial condition that involves both polygenic and environmental risk factors. Neuroimaging studies have implicated the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit in the pathophysiology of the disorder, which is supported by the observation of specific neuropsychological impairments in patients with OCD, mainly in executive functions. Genetic studies indicate that genes affecting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, and the interaction between them, play a crucial part in the functioning of this circuit. Environmental factors such as adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes and, hence, trigger the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.","Axon degeneration is a prominent early feature of most neurodegenerative disorders and can also be induced directly by nerve injury in a process known as Wallerian degeneration. The discovery of genetic mutations that delay Wallerian degeneration has provided insight into mechanisms underlying axon degeneration in disease. Rapid Wallerian degeneration requires the pro-degenerative molecules SARM1 and PHR1. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is essential for axon growth and survival. Its loss from injured axons may activate Wallerian degeneration, whereas NMNAT overexpression rescues axons from degeneration. Here, we discuss the roles of these and other proposed regulators of Wallerian degeneration, new opportunities for understanding disease mechanisms and intriguing links between Wallerian degeneration, innate immunity, synaptic growth and cell death.","Under normal conditions, food intake and energy expenditure are balanced by a homeostatic system that maintains stability of body fat content over time. However, this homeostatic system can be overridden by the activation of 'emergency response circuits' that mediate feeding responses to emergent or stressful stimuli. Inhibition of these circuits is therefore permissive for normal energy homeostasis to occur, and their chronic activation can cause profound, even life-threatening, changes in body fat mass. This Review highlights how the interplay between homeostatic and emergency feeding circuits influences the biologically defended level of body weight under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.","We might be forced to listen to a high-frequency tone at our audiologist's office or we might enjoy falling asleep with a white-noise machine, but the sounds that really matter to us are the voices of our companions or music from our favourite radio station. The auditory system has evolved to process behaviourally relevant natural sounds. Research has shown not only that our brain is optimized for natural hearing tasks but also that using natural sounds to probe the auditory system is the best way to understand the neural computations that enable us to comprehend speech or appreciate music.", , , , , , , , , ,"The ability to speak two languages often marvels monolinguals, although bilinguals report no difficulties in achieving this feat. Here, we examine how learning and using two languages affect language acquisition and processing as well as various aspects of cognition. We do so by addressing three main questions. First, how do infants who are exposed to two languages acquire them without apparent difficulty? Second, how does language processing differ between monolingual and bilingual adults? Last, what are the collateral effects of bilingualism on the executive control system across the lifespan? Research in all three areas has not only provided some fascinating insights into bilingualism but also revealed new issues related to brain plasticity and language learning.","Astrocyte Ca(2+) signalling has been proposed to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve a higher level of brain integration. However, some discrepancies in the results of recent studies challenge this view and highlight key insufficiencies in our current understanding. In parallel, new experimental approaches that enable the study of astrocyte physiology at higher spatial-temporal resolution in intact brain preparations are beginning to reveal an unexpected level of compartmentalization and sophistication in astrocytic Ca(2+) dynamics. This newly revealed complexity needs to be attentively considered in order to understand how astrocytes may contribute to brain information processing.","The loss of a limb or paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury has devastating consequences on quality of life. One approach to restoring lost sensory and motor abilities in amputees and patients with tetraplegia is to supply them with implants that provide a direct interface with the CNS. Such brain-machine interfaces might enable a patient to exert voluntary control over a prosthetic or robotic limb or over the electrically induced contractions of paralysed muscles. A parallel interface could convey sensory information about the consequences of these movements back to the patient. Recent developments in the algorithms that decode motor intention from neuronal activity and in approaches to convey sensory feedback by electrically stimulating neurons, using biomimetic and adaptation-based approaches, have shown the promise of invasive interfaces with sensorimotor cortices, although substantial challenges remain.","It has been over 20 years since JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) were identified as protein kinases that are strongly activated by cellular stress and that have a key role in apoptosis. Examination of Jnk-knockout mice and characterization of JNK behaviour in neuronal cells has further revealed the importance of the JNK family in the nervous system. As well as regulating neuronal death, JNKs govern brain morphogenesis and axodendritic architecture during development, and regulate important neuron-specific functions such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This Review examines the evidence that the spatial segregation of JNKs in neurons underlies their distinct functions and that compartment-specific targeting of JNKs may offer promising new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system, such as stroke and neurodegenerative disorders.", , ,"Mononuclear phagocytic cells in the CNS used to be defined according to their anatomical location and surface marker expression. Recently, this concept has been challenged by the results of developmental and gene expression profiling studies that have used novel molecular biological tools to unravel the origin of microglia and to define their role as specialized tissue macrophages with long lifespans. Here, we describe how these results have redefined microglia and helped us to understand how different myeloid cell populations operate in the CNS based on their cell-specific gene expression signatures, distinct ontogeny and differential functions. Moreover, we describe the vulnerability of microglia to dysfunction and propose that myelomonocytic cells might be used in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders that are characterized by primary or secondary 'microgliopathy'.", , , ,"The size and extent of folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex are important factors that influence a species' cognitive abilities and sensorimotor skills. Studies in various animal models and in humans have provided insight into the mechanisms that regulate cortical growth and folding. Both protein-coding genes and microRNAs control cortical size, and recent progress in characterizing basal progenitor cells and the genes that regulate their proliferation has contributed to our understanding of cortical folding. Neurological disorders linked to disruptions in cortical growth and folding have been associated with novel neurogenetic mechanisms and aberrant signalling pathways, and these findings have changed concepts of brain evolution and may lead to new medical treatments for certain disorders.","Microglia, the brain's professional phagocytes, can remove dead and dying neurons as well as synapses and the processes of live neurons. However, we and others have recently shown that microglia can also execute neuronal death by phagocytosing stressed-but-viable neurons - a process that we have termed phagoptosis. In this Progress article, we discuss evidence suggesting that phagoptosis may contribute to neuronal loss during brain development, inflammation, ischaemia and neurodegeneration.", ,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which cells regulate levels of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is well characterized in non-neuronal cells, a proliferation of papers over the past few years has revealed a key role for the UPR in normal neuronal function and as an important driver of neurodegenerative diseases. A complex scenario is emerging in which distinct UPR signalling modules have specific and even opposite effects on neurodegeneration depending on the disease context. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent findings addressing the biological relevance of ER stress in the nervous system.", , ,"Brain function relies on the ability of neurons to communicate with each other. Interneuronal communication primarily takes place at synapses, where information from one neuron is rapidly conveyed to a second neuron. There are two main modalities of synaptic transmission: chemical and electrical. Far from functioning independently and serving unrelated functions, mounting evidence indicates that these two modalities of synaptic transmission closely interact, both during development and in the adult brain. Rather than conceiving synaptic transmission as either chemical or electrical, this article emphasizes the notion that synaptic transmission is both chemical and electrical, and that interactions between these two forms of interneuronal communication might be required for normal brain development and function.", , , ,"We often assume that the variables of functional and structural brain parameters - such as synaptic weights, the firing rates of individual neurons, the synchronous discharge of neural populations, the number of synaptic contacts between neurons and the size of dendritic boutons - have a bell-shaped distribution. However, at many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain, the distribution of numerous parameters is in fact strongly skewed with a heavy tail, suggesting that skewed (typically lognormal) distributions are fundamental to structural and functional brain organization. This insight not only has implications for how we should collect and analyse data, it may also help us to understand how the different levels of skewed distributions - from synapses to cognition - are related to each other.", ,"Recent studies using transgenic mice lacking NMDA receptors in the hippocampus challenge the long-standing hypothesis that hippocampal long-term potentiation-like mechanisms underlie the encoding and storage of associative long-term spatial memories. However, it may not be the synaptic plasticity-dependent memory hypothesis that is wrong; instead, it may be the role of the hippocampus that needs to be re-examined. We present an account of hippocampal function that explains its role in both memory and anxiety.","Music is a universal feature of human societies, partly owing to its power to evoke strong emotions and influence moods. During the past decade, the investigation of the neural correlates of music-evoked emotions has been invaluable for the understanding of human emotion. Functional neuroimaging studies on music and emotion show that music can modulate activity in brain structures that are known to be crucially involved in emotion, such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, hippocampus, insula, cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. The potential of music to modulate activity in these structures has important implications for the use of music in the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.","The neurotransmitters GABA and glycine mediate fast synaptic inhibition by activating ligand-gated chloride channels--namely, type A GABA (GABA(A)) and glycine receptors. Both types of receptors are anchored postsynaptically by gephyrin, which self-assembles into a scaffold and interacts with the cytoskeleton. Current research indicates that postsynaptic gephyrin clusters are dynamic assemblies that are held together and regulated by multiple protein-protein interactions. Moreover, post-translational modifications of gephyrin regulate the formation and plasticity of GABAergic synapses by altering the clustering properties of postsynaptic scaffolds and thereby the availability and function of receptors and other signalling molecules. Here, we discuss the formation and regulation of the gephyrin scaffold, its role in GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic function and the implications for the pathophysiology of brain disorders caused by abnormal inhibitory neurotransmission.", , , , , ,"Left-handers are often excluded from study cohorts in neuroscience and neurogenetics in order to reduce variance in the data. However, recent investigations have shown that the inclusion or targeted recruitment of left-handers can be informative in studies on a range of topics, such as cerebral lateralization and the genetic underpinning of asymmetrical brain development. Left-handed individuals represent a substantial portion of the human population and therefore left-handedness falls within the normal range of human diversity; thus, it is important to account for this variation in our understanding of brain functioning. We call for neuroscientists and neurogeneticists to recognize the potential of studying this often-discarded group of research subjects.", , ,"There is now compelling evidence that the allocation of memory to specific neurons (neuronal allocation) and synapses (synaptic allocation) in a neurocircuit is not random and that instead specific mechanisms, such as increases in neuronal excitability and synaptic tagging and capture, determine the exact sites where memories are stored. We propose an integrated view of these processes, such that neuronal allocation, synaptic tagging and capture, spine clustering and metaplasticity reflect related aspects of memory allocation mechanisms. Importantly, the properties of these mechanisms suggest a set of rules that profoundly affect how memories are stored and recalled.", , , ,"Mammalian brains exhibit population oscillations, the structures of which vary in time and space according to behavioural state. A proposed function of these oscillations is to control the flow of signals among anatomically connected networks. However, the nature of neural coding that may support selective communication that depends on oscillations has received relatively little attention. Here, we consider the role of multiplexing, whereby multiple information streams share a common neural substrate. We suggest that multiplexing implemented through periodic modulation of firing-rate population codes enables flexible reconfiguration of effective connectivity among brain areas.", ,"Neurons integrate synaptic inputs across time and space, a process that determines the transformation of input signals into action potential output. This article explores how synaptic integration contributes to the richness of sensory signalling in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices. Whether a neuron receives a few or a few thousand discrete inputs, most evoked synaptic activity generates only subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations. Sensory tuning of synaptic inputs is typically broad, but short-term dynamics and the interplay between excitation and inhibition restrict action potential firing to narrow windows of opportunity. We highlight the challenges and limitations of the use of somatic recordings in the study of synaptic integration and the importance of active dendritic mechanisms in sensory processing.","Microglia and macrophages in the CNS contain multimolecular complexes termed inflammasomes. Inflammasomes function as intracellular sensors for infectious agents as well as for host-derived danger signals that are associated with neurological diseases, including meningitis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Assembly of an inflammasome activates caspase 1 and, subsequently, the proteolysis and release of the cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, as well as pyroptotic cell death. Since the discovery of inflammasomes in 2002, there has been burgeoning recognition of their complexities and functions. Here, we review the current understanding of the functions of different inflammasomes in the CNS and their roles in neurological diseases.", , , ,"Chemicals that are used experimentally to evoke itch elicit activity in diverse subpopulations of cutaneous pruriceptive neurons, all of which also respond to painful stimuli. However, itch is distinct from pain: it evokes different behaviours, such as scratching, and originates from the skin or certain mucosae but not from muscle, joints or viscera. New insights regarding the neurons that mediate the sensation of itch have been gained from experiments in which gene expression has been manipulated in different types of pruriceptive neurons as well as from comparisons between psychophysical measurements of itch and the neuronal discharges and other properties of peripheral and central pruriceptive neurons.","The remarkable ability of a single axon to extend multiple branches and form terminal arbors enables vertebrate neurons to integrate information from divergent regions of the nervous system. Axons select appropriate pathways during development, but it is the branches that extend interstitially from the axon shaft and arborize at specific targets that are responsible for virtually all of the synaptic connectivity in the vertebrate CNS. How do axons form branches at specific target regions? Recent studies have identified molecular cues that activate intracellular signalling pathways in axons and mediate dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton to promote the formation of axon branches.", , ,"Criminal behaviour and violence are increasingly viewed as worldwide public health problems. A growing body of knowledge shows that criminal behaviour has a neurobiological basis, and this has intensified judicial interest in the potential application of neuroscience to criminal law. It also gives rise to important questions. What are the implications of such application for predicting future criminal behaviour and protecting society? Can it be used to prevent violence? And what are the implications for the way offenders are punished?", ,"The extensive lengths of neuronal processes necessitate efficient mechanisms for communication with the cell body. Neuronal regeneration after nerve injury requires new transcription; thus, long-distance retrograde signalling from axonal lesion sites to the soma and nucleus is required. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mechanistic basis of this system. This has included the discovery of a priming role for early calcium waves; confirmation of central roles for mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling effectors, the importin family of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors and molecular motors such as dynein; and demonstration of the importance of local translation as a key regulatory mechanism. These recent findings provide a coherent mechanistic framework for axon-soma communication in the injured nerve and shed light on the integration of cytoplasmic and nuclear transport in all eukaryotic cells.", , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Jan;15(1):63.,Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Jan;15(1):63. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Apr;14(4):278-91.,"The CNS is endowed with an elaborated response repertoire termed 'neuroinflammation', which enables it to cope with pathogens, toxins, traumata and degeneration. On the basis of recent publications, we deduce that orchestrated actions of immune cells, vascular cells and neurons that constitute neuroinflammation are not only provoked by pathological conditions but can also be induced by increased neuronal activity. We suggest that the technical term 'neurogenic neuroinflammation' should be used for inflammatory reactions in the CNS in response to neuronal activity. We believe that neurogenic neuro-inflammation maintains homeostasis to enable the CNS to cope with enhanced metabolic demands and increases the computational power and plasticity of CNS neuronal networks. However, neurogenic neuroinflammation may also become maladaptive and aggravate the outcomes of pain, stress and epilepsy.","Synapses are constantly generated at a high rate in the developing, prepubescent brain. Newly generated glutamatergic synapses lack functional AMPA receptor-mediated transmission. Most of these 'AMPA-silent' synapses are eliminated during the developmental period, but some are specifically selected for AMPA unsilencing by correlated pre-and postsynaptic activity as the first step in a process that leads to stabilization of the synapse. Premature, or delayed, unsilencing of AMPA-silent synapses has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, and abnormal generation of AMPA-silent synapses is associated with brain trauma, addiction and neurodegenerative disorders, further highlighting the importance of AMPA-silent synapses in brain pathology.", , , ,"Humour is a vital component of human socio-affective and cognitive functioning. Recent advances in neuroscience have enabled researchers to explore this human attribute in children and adults. Humour seems to engage a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas involved in detecting and resolving incongruity (mismatch between expected and presented stimuli); and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the amygdala, key structures for reward and salience processing. Examining personality effects and sex differences in the neural correlates of humour may aid in understanding typical human behaviour and the neural mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders, which can have dramatic effects on the capacity to experience social reward.", , ,"Adults frequently provide compelling, detailed accounts of early childhood experiences in the courtroom. Judges and jurors are asked to decide guilt or innocence based solely on these decades-old memories using 'common sense' notions about memory. However, these notions are not in agreement with findings from neuroscientific and behavioural studies of memory development. Without expert guidance, judges and jurors may have difficulty in properly adjudicating the weight of memory evidence in cases involving adult recollections of childhood experiences.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877.,"Liver failure affects brain function, leading to neurological and psychiatric alterations; such alterations are referred to as hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Early diagnosis of minimal HE reveals an unexpectedly high incidence of mild cognitive impairment and psychomotor slowing in patients with liver cirrhosis - conditions that have serious health, social and economic consequences. The mechanisms responsible for the neurological alterations in HE are beginning to emerge. New therapeutic strategies acting on specific targets in the brain (phosphodiesterase 5, type A GABA receptors, cyclooxygenase and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38) have been shown to restore cognitive and motor function in animal models of chronic HE, and NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to increase survival in acute liver failure. This article reviews the latest studies aimed at understanding how liver failure affects brain function and potential ways to ameliorate these effects.",Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Aug;14(8):577-85. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877.,Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 May;14(5):365-76.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877., ,"Neuroscience studies into psychiatric disorders generally rely on disease definitions that are based on the influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the fifth edition of which (DSM-5) was released earlier this year. Designed as a purely diagnostic tool, the DSM considers different disorders as distinct entities. However, boundaries between disorders are often not as strict as the DSM suggests. To provide an alternative framework for research into psychiatric disorders, the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently introduced its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. In the RDoC, five 'domains' each reflect a brain system in which functioning is impaired, to different degrees, in different psychiatric conditions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked six leading investigators for their thoughts on how DSM-5 and the RDoC will influence neuroscience research into psychiatric disorders.","The past decade has witnessed a renewed interest in cortical local field potentials (LFPs)--that is, extracellularly recorded potentials with frequencies of up to ~500 Hz. This is due to both the advent of multielectrodes, which has enabled recording of LFPs at tens to hundreds of sites simultaneously, and the insight that LFPs offer a unique window into key integrative synaptic processes in cortical populations. However, owing to its numerous potential neural sources, the LFP is more difficult to interpret than are spikes. Careful mathematical modelling and analysis are needed to take full advantage of the opportunities that this signal offers in understanding signal processing in cortical circuits and, ultimately, the neural basis of perception and cognition.", , ,"Conduct disorder is a childhood behaviour disorder that is characterized by persistent aggressive or antisocial behaviour that disrupts the child's environment and impairs his or her functioning. A proportion of children with conduct disorder have psychopathic traits. Psychopathic traits consist of a callous-unemotional component and an impulsive-antisocial component, which are associated with two core impairments. The first is a reduced empathic response to the distress of other individuals, which primarily reflects reduced amygdala responsiveness to distress cues; the second is deficits in decision making and in reinforcement learning, which reflects dysfunction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum. Genetic and prenatal factors contribute to the abnormal development of these neural systems, and social-environmental variables that affect motivation influence the probability that antisocial behaviour will be subsequently displayed.","The sophisticated circuitry of the neocortex is assembled from a diverse repertoire of neuronal subtypes generated during development under precise molecular regulation. In recent years, several key controls over the specification and differentiation of neocortical projection neurons have been identified. This work provides substantial insight into the 'molecular logic' underlying cortical development and increasingly supports a model in which individual progenitor-stage and postmitotic regulators are embedded within highly interconnected networks that gate sequential developmental decisions. Here, we provide an integrative account of the molecular controls that direct the progressive development and delineation of subtype and area identity of neocortical projection neurons.", ,"Correlational data suggest that learned associations are encoded within neuronal ensembles. However, it has been difficult to prove that neuronal ensembles mediate learned behaviours because traditional pharmacological and lesion methods, and even newer cell type-specific methods, affect both activated and non-activated neurons. In addition, previous studies on synaptic and molecular alterations induced by learning did not distinguish between behaviourally activated and non-activated neurons. Here, we describe three new approaches--Daun02 inactivation, FACS sorting of activated neurons and Fos-GFP transgenic rats--that have been used to selectively target and study activated neuronal ensembles in models of conditioned drug effects and relapse. We also describe two new tools--Fos-tTA transgenic mice and inactivation of CREB-overexpressing neurons--that have been used to study the role of neuronal ensembles in conditioned fear.","Recent developments in functional neuroimaging have provided a number of new tools for assessing patients who clinically appear to be in a vegetative state. These techniques have been able to reveal awareness and even allow rudimentary communication in some patients who remain entirely behaviourally non-responsive. The implications of these results extend well beyond the immediate clinical and scientific findings to influencing legal proceedings, raising new ethical questions about the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration and providing new options for patients and families in that decision-making process. The findings have also motivated significant public discourse about the role of neuroscience research in society.", , , ,"Since the identification of the causative gene in Huntington's disease (HD), a number of animal models of this disorder have been developed. A frequently asked question is: which of these models most closely recapitulates the human disease? In this Review, we provide an overview of the currently available animal models of HD in the context of the clinical features of the disease. In doing so, we highlight their strengths and limitations for modelling specific symptoms of the disease. This should highlight the animal model that is best suited to address a particular question of interest and, ultimately, to expedite the discovery of treatments that will prevent or slow the progression of HD.","The fundamental perceptual unit in hearing is the 'auditory object'. Similar to visual objects, auditory objects are the computational result of the auditory system's capacity to detect, extract, segregate and group spectrotemporal regularities in the acoustic environment; the multitude of acoustic stimuli around us together form the auditory scene. However, unlike the visual scene, resolving the component objects within the auditory scene crucially depends on their temporal structure. Neural correlates of auditory objects are found throughout the auditory system. However, neural responses do not become correlated with a listener's perceptual reports until the level of the cortex. The roles of different neural structures and the contribution of different cognitive states to the perception of auditory objects are not yet fully understood.","In Drosophila melanogaster, the causal links among a complex behaviour, single neurons and single genes can be demonstrated through experimental manipulations. A key player in establishing the male courtship circuitry is the fruitless (fru) gene, the expression of which yields the FruM proteins in a subset of male but not female neurons. FruM probably regulates chromatin states, leading to single-neuron sex differences and, consequently, a sexually dimorphic circuitry. The mutual connections among fru-expressing neurons--including primary sensory afferents, central interneurons such as the P1 neuron cluster that triggers courtship, and courtship motor pattern generators--probably form the core portion of the male courtship circuitry.", , , ,"Neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being offered in court cases. Consequently, the legal system needs neuroscientists to act as expert witnesses who can explain the limitations and interpretations of neuroscientific findings so that judges and jurors can make informed and appropriate inferences. The growing role of neuroscientists in court means that neuroscientists should be aware of important differences between the scientific and legal fields, and, especially, how scientific facts can be easily misunderstood by non-scientists, including judges and jurors.", , , ,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) occupies a notable proportion of the CNS and contributes to its normal physiology. Alterations to the ECM occur after neural injury (for example, in multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or Alzheimer's disease) and can have drastic consequences. Of note, injury-induced changes in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs)--a family of ECM proteoglycans--can lead to the inhibition of myelin repair. Here, we highlight the pathophysiological roles of the brain's ECM, particularly those of CSPGs, after neural insults and discuss how the ECM can be targeted to promote remyelination.", , , , ,"Despite cash-strapped times for research, several ambitious collaborative neuroscience projects have attracted large amounts of funding and media attention. In Europe, the Human Brain Project aims to develop a large-scale computer simulation of the brain, whereas in the United States, the Brain Activity Map is working towards establishing a functional connectome of the entire brain, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science has embarked upon a 10-year project to understand the mouse visual cortex (the MindScope project). US President Barack Obama's announcement of the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative) in April 2013 highlights the political commitment to neuroscience and is expected to further foster interdisciplinary collaborations, accelerate the development of new technologies and thus fuel much needed medical advances. In this Viewpoint article, five prominent neuroscientists explain the aims of the projects and how they are addressing some of the questions (and criticisms) that have arisen.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Oct;14(10):736.,"Synaptic activity initiates biochemical processes that have various outcomes, including the formation of memories, increases in neuronal survival and the development of chronic pain and addiction. Virtually all activity-induced, long-lasting adaptations of brain functions require a dialogue between synapses and the nucleus that results in changes in gene expression. Calcium signals that are induced by synaptic activity and propagate into the nucleus are a major route for synapse-to-nucleus communication. Recent findings indicate that diverse forms of neuroadaptation require calcium transients in the nucleus to switch on the necessary genomic programme. Deficits in nuclear calcium signalling as a result of a reduction in synaptic activity or increased extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signalling may underlie the aetiologies of various diseases, including neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.", ,"Although memory can be hazy at times, it is often assumed that memories of violent or otherwise stressful events are so well encoded that they are effectively indelible and that confidently retrieved memories are almost certainly accurate. However, findings from basic psychological research and neuroscience studies indicate that memory is a reconstructive process that is susceptible to distortion. In the courtroom, even minor memory distortions can have severe consequences that are partly driven by common misunderstandings about memory--for example, that memory is more veridical than it may actually be.", , , , ,"Like all cells, neurons are made of proteins that have characteristic synthesis and degradation profiles. Unlike other cells, however, neurons have a unique multipolar architecture that makes ∼10,000 synaptic contacts with other neurons. Both the stability and modifiability of the neuronal proteome are crucial for its information-processing, storage and plastic properties. The cell biological mechanisms that synthesize, modify, deliver and degrade dendritic and synaptic proteins are not well understood but appear to reflect unique solutions adapted to the particular morphology of neurons.","Dementia is increasingly being recognized in cases of Parkinson's disease (PD); such cases are termed PD dementia (PDD). The spread of fibrillar α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures seems to be the strongest neuropathological correlate of emerging dementia in PD. In addition, up to 50% of patients with PDD also develop sufficient numbers of amyloid-β plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles for a secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and these pathologies may act synergistically with α-syn pathology to confer a worse prognosis. An understanding of the relationships between these three distinct pathologies and their resultant clinical phenotypes is crucial for the development of effective disease-modifying treatments for PD and PDD.", , , ,"Hypnosis uses the powerful effects of attention and suggestion to produce, modify and enhance a broad range of subjectively compelling experiences and behaviours. For more than a century, hypnotic suggestion has been used successfully as an adjunctive procedure to treat a wide range of clinical conditions. More recently, hypnosis has attracted a growing interest from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Recent studies using hypnotic suggestion show how manipulating subjective awareness in the laboratory can provide insights into brain mechanisms involved in attention, motor control, pain perception, beliefs and volition. Moreover, they indicate that hypnotic suggestion can create informative analogues of clinical conditions that may be useful for understanding these conditions and their treatments.", ,"In the developing brain, dendrite branches and dendritic spines form and turn over dynamically. By contrast, most dendrite arbors and dendritic spines in the adult brain are stable for months, years and possibly even decades. Emerging evidence reveals that dendritic spine and dendrite arbor stability have crucial roles in the correct functioning of the adult brain and that loss of stability is associated with psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie long-term dendrite stabilization, how these mechanisms differ from those used to mediate structural plasticity and how they are disrupted in disease.","Planar cell polarity (PCP) is complementary to the intrinsic polarization of single cells and refers to the global coordination of cell behaviour in the plane of a tissue and, by extension, to the signalling pathways that control it. PCP is most evident in cell sheets, and research into PCP was for years confined to studies in Drosophila melanogaster. However, PCP has more recently emerged as an important phenomenon in vertebrates, in which it regulates various developmental processes and is associated with multiple disorders. In particular, core PCP genes are crucial for the development and function of the nervous system. They are involved in neural tube closure, ependymal polarity, neuronal migration, dendritic growth and axon guidance.", , , , ,"Abnormal accumulation of brain iron has been detected in various neurodegenerative diseases, but the contribution of iron overload to pathology remains unclear. In a group of distinctive brain iron overload diseases known as 'neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation' (NBIA) diseases, nine disease genes have been identified. Brain iron accumulation is observed in the globus pallidus and other brain regions in NBIA diseases, which are often associated with severe dystonia and gait abnormalities. Only two of these diseases, aceruloplasminaemia and neuroferritinopathy, are directly caused by abnormalities in iron metabolism, mainly in astrocytes and neurons, respectively. Understanding the early molecular pathophysiology of these diseases should aid insights into the role of iron and the design of specific therapeutic approaches.", , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Dec;14(12):877.,"Uncertainty about a possible future threat disrupts our ability to avoid it or to mitigate its negative impact and thus results in anxiety. Here, we focus the broad literature on the neurobiology of anxiety through the lens of uncertainty. We identify five processes that are essential for adaptive anticipatory responses to future threat uncertainty and propose that alterations in the neural instantiation of these processes result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in pathological anxiety. This framework has the potential to advance the classification, diagnosis and treatment of clinical anxiety.","Histamine acts as a modulatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. It has an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness, and dysfunction in the histaminergic system has been linked to narcolepsy. Recent evidence suggests that aberrant histamine signalling in the brain may also be a key factor in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, Parkinson's disease and addictive behaviours. Furthermore, multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, which is an often-used model for MS, are associated with changes in the histaminergic system. This Review explores the possible roles of brain histamine in the mechanisms underlying these diseases.","Why do neurons sense extracellular acid? In large part, this question has driven increasing investigation on acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the CNS and the peripheral nervous system for the past two decades. Significant progress has been made in understanding the structure and function of ASICs at the molecular level. Studies aimed at clarifying their physiological importance have suggested roles for ASICs in pain, neurological and psychiatric disease. This Review highlights recent findings linking these channels to physiology and disease. In addition, it discusses some of the implications for therapy and points out questions that remain unanswered.", , , , ,"In the past 8 years, the US Supreme Court has issued landmark opinions in three cases that involved the criminal culpability of juveniles. In the most recent case, in 2012, a ruling prohibited states from mandating life without parole for crimes committed by minors. In these cases, the Court drew on scientific studies of the adolescent brain in concluding that adolescents, by virtue of their inherent psychological and neurobiological immaturity, are not as responsible for their behaviour as adults. This article discusses the Court's rationale in these cases and the role of scientific evidence about adolescent brain development in its decisions. I conclude that the neuroscientific evidence was probably persuasive to the Court not because it revealed something new about the nature of adolescence but precisely because it aligned with common sense and behavioural science.", , ,"Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in our modern world, with millions of people debilitated by conditions such as back pain, headache and arthritis. To address this growing problem, many people are turning to mind-body therapies, including meditation, yoga and cognitive behavioural therapy. This article will review the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain by cognitive and emotional states - important components of mind-body therapies. It will also examine the accumulating evidence that chronic pain itself alters brain circuitry, including that involved in endogenous pain control, suggesting that controlling pain becomes increasingly difficult as pain becomes chronic.", ,"The richness of perceptual experience, as well as its usefulness for guiding behaviour, depends on the synthesis of information across multiple senses. Recent decades have witnessed a surge in our understanding of how the brain combines sensory cues. Much of this research has been guided by one of two distinct approaches: one is driven primarily by neurophysiological observations, and the other is guided by principles of mathematical psychology and psychophysics. Conflicting results and interpretations have contributed to a conceptual gap between psychophysical and physiological accounts of cue integration, but recent studies of visual-vestibular cue integration have narrowed this gap considerably.","NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels and are crucial for neuronal communication. NMDARs form tetrameric complexes that consist of several homologous subunits. The subunit composition of NMDARs is plastic, resulting in a large number of receptor subtypes. As each receptor subtype has distinct biophysical, pharmacological and signalling properties, there is great interest in determining whether individual subtypes carry out specific functions in the CNS in both normal and pathological conditions. Here, we review the effects of subunit composition on NMDAR properties, synaptic plasticity and cellular mechanisms implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the rules and roles of NMDAR diversity could provide new therapeutic strategies against dysfunctions of glutamatergic transmission.", , , ,"Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction is a key pathophysiological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis, the impact of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease-relevant endophenotypes - including episodic memory and hippocampal volume - and the technological progress in measuring synaptic changes in humans all pave the way for a 'synaptic repair' therapy for neurodegenerative diseases that targets pathophysiology rather than pathogenesis. This article reviews the key issues in translating BDNF biology into synaptic repair therapies.", , , , ,"Sleep is universal in animals, but its specific functions remain elusive. We propose that sleep's primary function is to allow individual neurons to perform prophylactic cellular maintenance. Just as muscle cells must rest after strenuous exercise to prevent long-term damage, brain cells must rest after intense synaptic activity. We suggest that periods of reduced synaptic input ('off periods' or 'down states') are necessary for such maintenance. This in turn requires a state of globally synchronized neuronal activity, reduced sensory input and behavioural immobility - the well-known manifestations of sleep.","Contexts surround and imbue meaning to events; they are essential for recollecting the past, interpreting the present and anticipating the future. Indeed, the brain's capacity to contextualize information permits enormous cognitive and behavioural flexibility. Studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction in rodents and humans suggest that a neural circuit including the hippocampus, amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex is involved in the learning and memory processes that enable context-dependent behaviour. Dysfunction in this network may be involved in several forms of psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.", , ,"Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but the only available drug therapies target its symptoms rather than the underlying cause. The process that links brain injury or other predisposing factors to the subsequent emergence of epilepsy is termed epileptogenesis. Substantial research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms of epileptogenesis so as to identify more specific targets for intervention, with the hope of preventing epilepsy before seizures emerge. Recent work has yielded important conceptual advances in this field. We suggest that such insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis converge at the level of cortical circuit dysfunction.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Jun;14(6):451.,"Re-entrant or feedback pathways between cortical areas carry rich and varied information about behavioural context, including attention, expectation, perceptual tasks, working memory and motor commands. Neurons receiving such inputs effectively function as adaptive processors that are able to assume different functional states according to the task being executed. Recent data suggest that the selection of particular inputs, representing different components of an association field, enable neurons to take on different functional roles. In this Review, we discuss the various top-down influences exerted on the visual cortical pathways and highlight the dynamic nature of the receptive field, which allows neurons to carry information that is relevant to the current perceptual demands.", ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Jun;14(6):451., , , , ,"Brain structure varies between people in a markedly organized fashion. Communities of brain regions co-vary in their morphological properties. For example, cortical thickness in one region influences the thickness of structurally and functionally connected regions. Such networks of structural co-variance partially recapitulate the functional networks of healthy individuals and the foci of grey matter loss in neurodegenerative disease. This architecture is genetically heritable, is associated with behavioural and cognitive abilities and is changed systematically across the lifespan. The biological meaning of this structural co-variance remains controversial, but it appears to reflect developmental coordination or synchronized maturation between areas of the brain. This Review discusses the state of current research into brain structural co-variance, its underlying mechanisms and its potential value in the understanding of various neurological and psychiatric conditions.", ,"Inverse comorbidity is a lower-than-expected probability of disease occuring in individuals who have been diagnosed with other medical conditions. Emerging evidence points to inverse cancer comorbidity in people with certain CNS disorders. In this Opinion article, we discuss the evidence for this intriguing association and possible underlying mechanisms. We believe that this association is an invaluable opportunity to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these diseases, and understanding why certain individuals with CNS disorders are protected against many different types of cancer could help to develop new and improved treatments.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Aug;14(8):522. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Jan;15(1):63. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Jan;15(1):63., ,"The aquaporins (AQPs) are plasma membrane water-transporting proteins. AQP4 is the principal member of this protein family in the CNS, where it is expressed in astrocytes and is involved in water movement, cell migration and neuroexcitation. AQP1 is expressed in the choroid plexus, where it facilitates cerebrospinal fluid secretion, and in dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it tunes pain perception. The AQPs are potential drug targets for several neurological conditions. Astrocytoma cells strongly express AQP4, which may facilitate their infiltration into the brain, and the neuroinflammatory disease neuromyelitis optica is caused by AQP4-specific autoantibodies that produce complement-mediated astrocytic damage.","Myosins are a large family of actin-based cytoskeletal motors that use energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to generate movement and force. Myosins of classes II, V and VI have specific pre- and postsynaptic roles that are required for synapse function. They also facilitate several forms of synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, the myosins of these classes differ markedly in important aspects of their molecular mechanisms of function. Accordingly, their major roles at synapses are diverse and include the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in dendritic spines and powering of synaptic cargo transport.", ,"Several recent breakthroughs have provided notable insights into the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with some even shifting our thinking about this neurodegenerative disease and raising the question as to whether this disorder is a proteinopathy, a ribonucleopathy or both. In addition, these breakthroughs have revealed mechanistic links between ALS and frontotemporal dementia, as well as between ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as the cerebellar atrophies, myotonic dystrophy and inclusion body myositis. Here, we summarize the new findings in ALS research, discuss what they have taught us about this disease and examine issues that are still outstanding.", , , , ,"Attention allows us to select relevant sensory information for preferential processing. Behaviourally, it improves performance in various visual tasks. One prominent effect of attention is the modulation of performance in tasks that involve the visual system's spatial resolution. Physiologically, attention modulates neuronal responses and alters the profile and position of receptive fields near the attended location. Here, we develop a hypothesis linking the behavioural and electrophysiological evidence. The proposed framework seeks to explain how these receptive field changes enhance the visual system's effective spatial resolution and how the same mechanisms may also underlie attentional effects on the representation of spatial information.","The specialized architecture of neurons necessitates unique modes of intracellular communication to allow for cell survival, the ability to detect and respond to injury and aspects of neuronal development, such as axon and dendrite growth, plasticity, and synapse and circuit formation. Many of these neuronal processes rely on signal transduction pathways and transcriptional programmes that are activated by retrograde signals originating from target-derived cues that act on distal axons. Here, we review the many functions of long-range distal axon-to-cell body signalling and discuss mechanisms of retrograde target-derived growth factor signalling.", , , , ,"A large number of competing models exist for how the brain creates a representation of time. However, several human and animal studies point to 'climbing neural activation' as a potential neural mechanism for the representation of duration. Neurophysiological recordings in animals have revealed how climbing neural activation that peaks at the end of a timed interval underlies the processing of duration, and, in humans, climbing neural activity in the insular cortex, which is associated with feeling states of the body and emotions, may be related to the cumulative representation of time.", , ,"A systematic classification and accepted nomenclature of neuron types is much needed but is currently lacking. This article describes a possible taxonomical solution for classifying GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex based on a novel, web-based interactive system that allows experts to classify neurons with pre-determined criteria. Using Bayesian analysis and clustering algorithms on the resulting data, we investigated the suitability of several anatomical terms and neuron names for cortical GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, we show that supervised classification models could automatically categorize interneurons in agreement with experts' assignments. These results demonstrate a practical and objective approach to the naming, characterization and classification of neurons based on community consensus.","The intracellular transport of organelles along an axon is crucial for the maintenance and function of a neuron. Anterograde axonal transport has a role in supplying proteins and lipids to the distal synapse and mitochondria for local energy requirements, whereas retrograde transport is involved in the clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins from the axon and the intracellular transport of distal trophic signals to the soma. Axonal transport can be affected by alterations to various components of the transport machinery. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about axonal transport defects that might contribute to the pathogenesis of particular neurodegenerative diseases.", , , , ,"Feelings are mental experiences of body states. They signify physiological need (for example, hunger), tissue injury (for example, pain), optimal function (for example, well-being), threats to the organism (for example, fear or anger) or specific social interactions (for example, compassion, gratitude or love). Feelings constitute a crucial component of the mechanisms of life regulation, from simple to complex. Their neural substrates can be found at all levels of the nervous system, from individual neurons to subcortical nuclei and cortical regions.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity both in civilian life and on the battlefield worldwide. Survivors of TBI frequently experience long-term disabling changes in cognition, sensorimotor function and personality. Over the past three decades, animal models have been developed to replicate the various aspects of human TBI, to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and to explore potential treatments. Nevertheless, promising neuroprotective drugs that were identified as being effective in animal TBI models have all failed in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials. This failure in clinical translation of preclinical studies highlights a compelling need to revisit the current status of animal models of TBI and therapeutic strategies.","When we attempt to fix our gaze, our eyes nevertheless produce so-called 'fixational eye movements', which include microsaccades, drift and tremor. Fixational eye movements thwart neural adaptation to unchanging stimuli and thus prevent and reverse perceptual fading during fixation. Over the past 10 years, microsaccade research has become one of the most active fields in visual, oculomotor and even cognitive neuroscience. The similarities and differences between microsaccades and saccades have been a most intriguing area of study, and the results of this research are leading us towards a unified theory of saccadic and microsaccadic function.","Long-lasting memories require specific gene expression programmes that are, in part, orchestrated by epigenetic mechanisms. Of the epigenetic modifications identified in cognitive processes, histone acetylation has spurred considerable interest. Whereas increments in histone acetylation have consistently been shown to favour learning and memory, a lack thereof has been causally implicated in cognitive impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegeneration and ageing. As histone acetylation and cognitive functions can be pharmacologically restored by histone deacetylase inhibitors, this epigenetic modification might constitute a molecular memory aid on the chromatin and, by extension, a new template for therapeutic interventions against cognitive frailty.", ,"What evolutionary events led to the emergence of human cognition? Although the genetic differences separating modern humans from both non-human primates (for example, chimpanzees) and archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) are known, linking human-specific mutations to the cognitive phenotype remains a challenge. One strategy is to focus on human-specific changes at the level of intermediate phenotypes, such as gene expression and metabolism, in conjunction with evolutionary changes in gene regulation involving transcription factors, microRNA and proximal regulatory elements. In this Review we show how this strategy has yielded some of the first hints about the mechanisms of human cognition.", , , , , ,"Disorders characterized by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, Lewy body formation and parkinsonism (and in some cases dementia) are collectively known as Lewy body diseases. The molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) through which α-syn abnormally accumulates and contributes to neurodegeneration in these disorders remains unknown. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge and prevailing hypotheses regarding the conformational, oligomerization and aggregation states of α-syn and their role in regulating α-syn function in health and disease. Understanding the nature of the various α-syn structures, how they are formed and their relative contributions to α-syn-mediated toxicity may inform future studies aiming to develop therapeutic prevention and intervention.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)--a member of a small family of secreted proteins that includes nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 and neurotrophin 4--has emerged as a key regulator of neural circuit development and function. The expression, secretion and actions of BDNF are directly controlled by neural activity, and secreted BDNF is capable of mediating many activity-dependent processes in the mammalian brain, including neuronal differentiation and growth, synapse formation and plasticity, and higher cognitive functions. This Review summarizes some of the recent progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurotrophin regulation of neural circuits. The focus of the article is on BDNF, as this is the most widely expressed and studied neurotrophin in the mammalian brain.", ,"The voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.7 is preferentially expressed in peripheral somatic and visceral sensory neurons, olfactory sensory neurons and sympathetic ganglion neurons. Na(V)1.7 accumulates at nerve fibre endings and amplifies small subthreshold depolarizations, poising it to act as a threshold channel that regulates excitability. Genetic and functional studies have added to the evidence that Na(V)1.7 is a major contributor to pain signalling in humans, and homology modelling based on crystal structures of ion channels suggests an atomic-level structural basis for the altered gating of mutant Na(V)1.7 that causes pain.","Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)--disorders of energy homeostasis and glucose homeostasis, respectively--are tightly linked and the incidences of both conditions are increasing in parallel. The CNS integrates information regarding peripheral nutrient and hormonal changes and processes this information to regulate energy homeostasis. Recent findings indicate that some of the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying energy balance are also essential for the regulation of glucose homeostasis. We propose that disruption of these overlapping pathways links the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and T2DM. A better understanding of these converging mechanisms may lead to therapeutic strategies that target both T2DM and obesity.", , , , , ,"The circadian clock machinery is responsible for biological timekeeping on a systemic level. The central clock system controls peripheral clocks through a number of output cues that synchronize the system as a whole. There is growing evidence that changing cellular metabolic states have important effects on circadian rhythms and can thereby influence neuronal function and disease. Epigenetic control has also been implicated in the modulation of biological timekeeping, and cellular metabolism and epigenetic state seem to be closely linked. We discuss the idea that cellular metabolic state and epigenetic mechanisms might work through the circadian clock to regulate neuronal function and influence disease states.","Synaptic transmission in the brain generally depends on action potentials. However, recent studies indicate that subthreshold variation in the presynaptic membrane potential also determines spike-evoked transmission. The informational content of each presynaptic action potential is therefore greater than initially expected. The contribution of this synaptic property, which is a fast (from 0.01 to 10 s) and state-dependent modulation of functional coupling, has been largely underestimated and could have important consequences for our understanding of information processing in neural networks. We discuss here how the membrane voltage of the presynaptic terminal might modulate neurotransmitter release by mechanisms that do not involve a change in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx.", ,"All cells are influenced by mechanical forces. In the brain, force-generating and load-bearing proteins twist, turn, ratchet, flex, compress, expand and bend to mediate neuronal signalling and plasticity. Although the functions of mechanosensitive proteins have been thoroughly described in classical sensory systems, the effects of endogenous mechanical energy on cellular function in the brain have received less attention, and many working models in neuroscience do not currently integrate principles of cellular mechanics. An understanding of cellular-mechanical concepts is essential to allow the integration of mechanobiology into ongoing studies of brain structure and function.","A clear majority of patients with chronic pain are women; however, it has been surprisingly difficult to determine whether this sex bias corresponds to actual sex differences in pain sensitivity. A survey of the currently available epidemiological and laboratory data indicates that the evidence for clinical and experimental sex differences in pain is overwhelming. Various explanations for this phenomenon have been given, ranging from experiential and sociocultural differences in pain experience between men and women to hormonally and genetically driven sex differences in brain neurochemistry.","Down syndrome is the most common form of intellectual disability and results from one of the most complex genetic perturbations that is compatible with survival, trisomy 21. The study of brain dysfunction in this disorder has largely been based on a gene discovery approach, but we are now moving into an era of functional genome exploration, in which the effects of individual genes are being studied alongside the effects of deregulated non-coding genetic elements and epigenetic influences. Also, new data from functional neuroimaging studies are challenging our views of the cognitive phenotypes associated with Down syndrome and their pathophysiological correlates. These advances hold promise for the development of treatments for intellectual disability.","Genetic and environmental factors control morphological and functional differences between the two sides of the nervous system. Neural asymmetries are proposed to have important roles in circuit physiology, cognition and species-specific behaviours. We propose two fundamentally different mechanisms for encoding left-right asymmetry in neural circuits. In the first, asymmetric circuits share common components; in the second, there are unique unilateral structures. Research in both vertebrates and invertebrates is helping to reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of neural lateralization, but less is known about the function of circuit asymmetries. Technical advances in the coming years are likely to revolutionize our understanding of left-right asymmetry in the nervous system.","The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (OLIG1) and OLIG2 are structurally similar and, to a first approximation, coordinately expressed in the developing CNS and postnatal brain. Despite these similarities, it was apparent from early on after their discovery that OLIG1 and OLIG2 have non-overlapping developmental functions in patterning, neuron subtype specification and the formation of oligodendrocytes. Here, we summarize more recent insights into the separate roles of these transcription factors in the postnatal brain during repair processes and in neurological disease states, including multiple sclerosis and malignant glioma. We discuss how the unique functions of OLIG1 and OLIG2 may reflect their distinct genetic targets, co-regulator proteins and/or post-translational modifications.", , , , , , , , ,"Thirty years have passed since the publication of Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper and Paul Munro's 'Theory for the development of neuron selectivity: orientation specificity and binocular interaction in visual cortex', known as the BCM theory of synaptic plasticity. This theory has guided experimentalists to discover some fundamental properties of synaptic plasticity and has provided a mathematical structure that bridges molecular mechanisms and systems-level consequences of learning and memory storage.","Honeybees contradict the notion that insect behaviour tends to be relatively inflexible and stereotypical. Indeed, they live in colonies and exhibit complex social, navigational and communication behaviours, as well as a relatively rich cognitive repertoire. Because these relatively complex behaviours are controlled by a brain consisting of only 1 million or so neurons, honeybees offer an opportunity to study the relationship between behaviour and cognition in neural networks that are limited in size and complexity. Most recently, the honeybee has been used to model learning and memory formation, highlighting its utility for neuroscience research, in particular for understanding the basis of cognition.", , ,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the only major mental disorder for which a cause is considered to be known: that is, an event that involves threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others and induces a response of intense fear, helplessness or horror. Although PTSD is still largely regarded as a psychological phenomenon, over the past three decades the growth of the biological PTSD literature has been explosive, and thousands of references now exist. Ultimately, the impact of an environmental event, such as a psychological trauma, must be understood at organic, cellular and molecular levels. This Review attempts to present the current state of this understanding on the basis of psychophysiological, structural and functional neuroimaging, and endocrinological, genetic and molecular biological studies in humans and in animal models.", ,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellularly acting enzymes that have long been known to have deleterious roles in brain injury and disease. In particular, widespread and protracted MMP activity can contribute to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. However, recent studies show that rapid and focal MMP-mediated proteolysis proactively drives synaptic structural and functional remodelling that is crucial for ongoing cognitive processes. Deficits in synaptic remodelling are associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, and aberrant MMP expression or function may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits. This Review explores the paradigm shift in our understanding of the contribution of MMPs to normal and abnormal synaptic plasticity and function.","The social and neural sciences share a common interest in understanding the mechanisms that underlie human behaviour. However, interactions between neuroscience and social science disciplines remain strikingly narrow and tenuous. We illustrate the scope and challenges for such interactions using the paradigmatic example of neuroeconomics. Using quantitative analyses of both its scientific literature and the social networks in its intellectual community, we show that neuroeconomics now reflects a true disciplinary integration, such that research topics and scientific communities with interdisciplinary span exert greater influence on the field. However, our analyses also reveal key structural and intellectual challenges in balancing the goals of neuroscience with those of the social sciences. To address these challenges, we offer a set of prescriptive recommendations for directing future research in neuroeconomics.", , , , ,"Although the perirhinal cortex (PRC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) have an essential role in memory, the precise functions of these areas are poorly understood. Here, we review the anatomical and functional characteristics of these areas based on studies in humans, monkeys and rats. Our Review suggests that the PRC and PHC-RSC are core components of two separate large-scale cortical networks that are dissociable by neuroanatomy, susceptibility to disease and function. These networks not only support different types of memory but also appear to support different aspects of cognition.", , ,"Recent years have witnessed the rise of the gut microbiota as a major topic of research interest in biology. Studies are revealing how variations and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota influence normal physiology and contribute to diseases ranging from inflammation to obesity. Accumulating data now indicate that the gut microbiota also communicates with the CNS--possibly through neural, endocrine and immune pathways--and thereby influences brain function and behaviour. Studies in germ-free animals and in animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections, probiotic bacteria or antibiotic drugs suggest a role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of anxiety, mood, cognition and pain. Thus, the emerging concept of a microbiota-gut-brain axis suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota may be a tractable strategy for developing novel therapeutics for complex CNS disorders.", , ,"Kainate receptors are a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors whose physiological roles differ from those of other subtypes of glutamate receptors in that they predominantly serve as modulators, rather than mediators, of synaptic transmission. Neuronal kainate receptors exhibit unusually slow kinetic properties that have been difficult to reconcile with the behaviour of recombinant kainate receptors. Recently, however, the neuropilin and tolloid-like 1 (NETO1) and NETO2 proteins were identified as auxiliary kainate receptor subunits that shape both the biophysical properties and synaptic localization of these receptors.",Comment in Brain Behav Evol. 2013;81(4):206-8., ,"In a departure from previous top-down or bottom-up strategies used to understand neuronal circuits, many forward-looking research programs now place the circuit itself at their centre. This has led to an emphasis on the dissection and elucidation of neuronal circuit elements and mechanisms, and on studies that ask how these circuits generate behavioural outputs. This movement towards circuit-centric strategies is progressing rapidly as a result of technological advances that combine genetic manipulation with light-based methods. The core tools of these new approaches are genetically encoded optical indicators and actuators that enable non-destructive interrogation and manipulation of neuronal circuits in behaving animals with cellular-level precision. This Review examines genetically encoded reporters of neuronal function and assesses their value for circuit-oriented neuroscientific investigations.", , , ,"The adult mammalian brain has a remarkable capacity to learn in both the perceptual and motor domains through the formation and consolidation of memories. Such practice-enabled procedural learning results in perceptual and motor skill improvements. Here, we examine evidence supporting the notion that perceptual and motor learning in humans exhibit analogous properties, including similarities in temporal dynamics and the interactions between primary cortical and higher-order brain areas. These similarities may point to the existence of a common general mechanism for learning in humans.","Research has demonstrated that extensive structural and functional brain development continues throughout adolescence. A popular notion emerging from this work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could explain adolescents' high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities. These changes in social-affective processing also may confer some adaptive advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one's intrinsic motivations and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.", , ,"Semaphorins are key players in the control of neural circuit development. Recent studies have uncovered several exciting and novel aspects of neuronal semaphorin signalling in various cellular processes--including neuronal polarization, topographical mapping and axon sorting--that are crucial for the assembly of functional neuronal connections. This progress is important for further understanding the many neuronal and non-neuronal functions of semaphorins and for gaining insight into their emerging roles in the perturbed neural connectivity that is observed in some diseases. This Review discusses recent advances in semaphorin research, focusing on novel aspects of neuronal semaphorin receptor regulation and previously unexplored cellular functions of semaphorins in the nervous system.", ,"Studies on synaptic plasticity in the context of learning have been dominated by the view that a single, particular type of plasticity forms the underlying mechanism for a particular type of learning. However, emerging evidence shows that many forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity at different sites are induced conjunctively during procedural memory formation in the cerebellum. Here, we review the main forms of long-term plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that underlie motor learning. We propose that the different forms of plasticity in the granular layer and the molecular layer operate synergistically in a temporally and spatially distributed manner, so as to ultimately create optimal output for behaviour.", , , ,"Fear is an emotion that has powerful effects on behaviour and physiology across animal species. It is accepted that the amygdala has a central role in processing fear. However, it is less widely appreciated that distinct amygdala outputs and downstream circuits are involved in different types of fear. Data show that fear of painful stimuli, predators and aggressive members of the same species are processed in independent neural circuits that involve the amygdala and downstream hypothalamic and brainstem circuits. Here, we discuss data supporting multiple fear pathways and the implications of this distributed system for understanding and treating fear.", , ,"Novel classes of small and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are being characterized at a rapid pace, driven by recent paradigm shifts in our understanding of genomic architecture, regulation and transcriptional output, as well as by innovations in sequencing technologies and computational and systems biology. These ncRNAs can interact with DNA, RNA and protein molecules; engage in diverse structural, functional and regulatory activities; and have roles in nuclear organization and transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic processes. This expanding inventory of ncRNAs is implicated in mediating a broad spectrum of processes including brain evolution, development, synaptic plasticity and disease pathogenesis.","The voltage-gated calcium channel α(2)δ and β subunits are traditionally considered to be auxiliary subunits that enhance channel trafficking, increase the expression of functional calcium channels at the plasma membrane and influence the channels' biophysical properties. Accumulating evidence indicates that these subunits may also have roles in the nervous system that are not directly linked to calcium channel function. For example, β subunits may act as transcriptional regulators, and certain α(2)δ subunits may function in synaptogenesis. The aim of this Review is to examine both the classic and novel roles for these auxiliary subunits in voltage-gated calcium channel function and beyond.", ,"Recent research has linked bodily self-consciousness to the processing and integration of multisensory bodily signals in temporoparietal, premotor, posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices. Studies in which subjects receive ambiguous multisensory information about the location and appearance of their own body have shown that these brain areas reflect the conscious experience of identifying with the body (self-identification (also known as body-ownership)), the experience of where 'I' am in space (self-location) and the experience of the position from where 'I' perceive the world (first-person perspective). Along with phenomena of altered states of self-consciousness in neurological patients and electrophysiological data from non-human primates, these findings may form the basis for a neurobiological model of bodily self-consciousness.", ,"Recent discoveries show that behaviourally relevant sensory experience drives the production of oestradiol - the classic sex steroid oestrogen - in auditory neurons in the adult brain of both males and females. This brain-generated oestrogen markedly enhances the efficiency of the neural coding of acoustic cues and shapes auditory-based behaviours on a timescale that is relevant for sensory processing and congruent with the action of rapid neuromodulators. These findings are re-shaping our current understanding of the mechanistic framework that supports sensory processing and the functional roles of hormones in the brain, and have implications for multiple health issues.", , ,"How we estimate uncertainty is important in decision neuroscience and has wide-ranging implications in basic and clinical neuroscience, from computational models of optimality to ideas on psychopathological disorders including anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. Empirical research in neuroscience, which has been based on divergent theoretical assumptions, has focused on the fundamental question of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain and how it influences behaviour. Here, we integrate several theoretical concepts about uncertainty into a decision-making framework. We conclude that the currently available evidence indicates that distinct neural encoding (including summary statistic-type representations) of uncertainty occurs in distinct neural systems.","Intracranial recordings in subjects suffering from intractable epilepsy - made during their evaluation for an eventual surgical removal of the epileptic focus - have allowed the extraordinary opportunity to study the firing of multiple single neurons in awake and behaving human subjects. These studies have shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe respond in a remarkably selective and abstract manner to particular persons or objects, such as Jennifer Aniston, Luke Skywalker or the Tower of Pisa. These neurons have been named 'Jennifer Aniston neurons' or, more recently, 'concept cells'. I argue that the sparse, explicit and abstract representation of these neurons is crucial for memory functions, such as the creation of associations and the transition between related concepts that leads to episodic memories and the flow of consciousness.", ,"The essential amino acid tryptophan is not only a precursor of serotonin but is also degraded to several other neuroactive compounds, including kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid. The synthesis of these metabolites is regulated by an enzymatic cascade, known as the kynurenine pathway, that is tightly controlled by the immune system. Dysregulation of this pathway, resulting in hyper-or hypofunction of active metabolites, is associated with neurodegenerative and other neurological disorders, as well as with psychiatric diseases such as depression and schizophrenia. With recently developed pharmacological agents, it is now possible to restore metabolic equilibrium and envisage novel therapeutic interventions.", , , ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Aug;13(8):597.,"The availability of neuroimaging technology has spurred a marked increase in the human cognitive neuroscience literature, including the study of cognitive ageing. Although there is a growing consensus that the ageing brain retains considerable plasticity of function, currently measured primarily by means of functional MRI, it is less clear how age differences in brain activity relate to cognitive performance. The field is also hampered by the complexity of the ageing process itself and the large number of factors that are influenced by age. In this Review, current trends and unresolved issues in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing are discussed.","Recent studies have provided long-sought evidence that behavioural learning involves specific synapse gain and elimination processes, which lead to memory traces that influence behaviour. The connectivity rearrangements are preceded by enhanced synapse turnover, which can be modulated through changes in inhibitory connectivity. Behaviourally related synapse rearrangement events tend to co-occur spatially within short stretches of dendrites, and involve signalling pathways partially overlapping with those controlling the functional plasticity of synapses. The new findings suggest that a mechanistic understanding of learning and memory processes will require monitoring ensembles of synapses in situ and the development of synaptic network models that combine changes in synaptic function and connectivity.","Over the past five years the field of neurogenetics has yielded a wealth of data that have facilitated a much greater understanding of the aetiology of many neurological diseases. Most of these advances are a result of improvements in technology that have allowed us to determine whole-genome structure and variation and to examine its impact on phenotype in an unprecedented manner. Genome-wide association studies have provided information on how common genetic variability imparts risk for the development of various complex diseases. Moreover, the identification of rare disease-causing mutations have led to the discovery of novel biochemical pathways that are involved in disease pathogensis. Here, we review these advances and discuss how they have changed the approaches being used to study neurological disorders.", , , , , , , ,"Neuronal activity in the brain gives rise to transmembrane currents that can be measured in the extracellular medium. Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.","Caspases are cysteine proteases that mediate apoptosis, which is a form of regulated cell death that effectively and efficiently removes extra and unnecessary cells during development. In the mature nervous system, caspases are not only involved in mediating cell death but also regulatory events that are important for neural functions, such as axon pruning and synapse elimination, which are necessary to refine mature neuronal circuits. Furthermore, caspases can be reactivated to cause cell death as well as non-lethal changes in neurons during numerous pathological processes. Thus, although a global activation of caspases leads to apoptosis, restricted and localized activation may control normal physiology and pathophysiology in living neurons. This Review explores the multiple roles of caspase activity in neurons.","GABA(B) receptors (GABA(B)Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors for GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. In the past 5 years, notable advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular composition of these receptors. GABA(B)Rs are now known to comprise principal and auxiliary subunits that influence receptor properties in distinct ways. The principal subunits regulate the surface expression and the axonal versus dendritic distribution of these receptors, whereas the auxiliary subunits determine agonist potency and the kinetics of the receptor response. This Review summarizes current knowledge on how the subunit composition of GABA(B)Rs affects the distribution of these receptors, neuronal processes and higher brain functions.", , ,"In recent years, novel model systems have made significant contributions to our understanding of the processes that control the ageing of whole organisms. However, there are limited data to show that the mechanisms that gerontologists have identified as having a role in organismal ageing contribute significantly to the ageing of the central nervous system. Two recent discoveries illustrate this particularly well. The first is the consistent failure of researchers to demonstrate a simple relationship between organismal ageing and oxidative stress--a mechanism often assumed to have a primary role in brain ageing. The second is the demonstration that senescent cells play a causal part in organismal ageing but remain essentially unstudied in a CNS context. We argue that the animal models now available (including rodents, flies, molluscs and worms), if properly applied, will allow a paradigm shift in our current understanding of the normal processes of brain ageing.", , ,"Pioneering studies in the middle of the twentieth century revealed substantial diversity among mammalian chemical synapses and led to a widely accepted classification of synapse type on the basis of neurotransmitter molecule identity. Subsequently, powerful new physiological, genetic and structural methods have enabled the discovery of much deeper functional and molecular diversity within each traditional neurotransmitter type. Today, this deep diversity continues to pose both daunting challenges and exciting new opportunities for neuroscience. Our growing understanding of deep synapse diversity may transform how we think about and study neural circuit development, structure and function.", , ,"Experiences of social rejection, exclusion or loss are generally considered to be some of the most 'painful' experiences that we endure. Indeed, many of us go to great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences (such as public speaking). Why is it that these negative social experiences have such a profound effect on our emotional well-being? Emerging evidence suggests that experiences of social pain--the painful feelings associated with social disconnection--rely on some of the same neurobiological substrates that underlie experiences of physical pain. Understanding the ways in which physical and social pain overlap may provide new insights into the surprising relationship between these two types of experiences.", , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Sep;13(9):650.,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Aug;13(8):597., ,"The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its size--relative to the size of the body--and many aspects of brain network organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.", , , , ,"Optogenetic tools have provided a new way to establish causal relationships between brain activity and behaviour in health and disease. Although no animal model captures human disease precisely, behaviours that recapitulate disease symptoms may be elicited and modulated by optogenetic methods, including behaviours that are relevant to anxiety, fear, depression, addiction, autism and parkinsonism. The rapid proliferation of optogenetic reagents together with the swift advancement of strategies for implementation has created new opportunities for causal and precise dissection of the circuits underlying brain diseases in animal models.","Central and peripheral insulin-like peptides (ILPs), which include insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF2, exert many effects in the brain. Through their actions on brain growth and differentiation, ILPs contribute to building circuitries that subserve metabolic and behavioural adaptation to internal and external cues of energy availability. In the adult brain each ILP has distinct effects, but together their actions ultimately regulate energy homeostasis - they affect nutrient sensing and regulate neuronal plasticity to modulate adaptive behaviours involved in food seeking, including high-level cognitive operations such as spatial memory. In essence, the multifaceted activity of ILPs in the brain may be viewed as a system organization involved in the control of energy allocation.", , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Jul;13(7):514; author reply 514.,"Ageing leads to a functional deterioration of many brain systems, including the circadian clock--an internal time-keeping system that generates ∼24-hour rhythms in physiology and behaviour. Numerous clinical studies have established a direct correlation between abnormal circadian clock functions and the severity of neurodegenerative and sleep disorders. Latest data from experiments in model organisms, gene expression studies and clinical trials imply that dysfunctions of the circadian clock contribute to ageing and age-associated pathologies, thereby suggesting a functional link between the circadian clock and age-associated decline of brain functions. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying this link include the circadian control of physiological processes such as brain metabolism, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, hormone secretion, autophagy and stem cell proliferation.", ,"Normal ageing is associated with impairments in cognitive function, including memory. These impairments are linked, not to a loss of neurons in the forebrain, but to specific and relatively subtle synaptic alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Here, we review studies that have shed light on the cellular and synaptic changes observed in these brain structures during ageing that can be directly related to cognitive decline in young and aged animals. We also discuss the influence of the hormonal status on these age-related alterations and recent progress in the development of therapeutic strategies to limit the impact of ageing on memory and cognition in humans.", , ,"High-resolution, comprehensive structural information is often the final arbiter between competing mechanistic models of biological processes, and can serve as inspiration for new hypotheses. In molecular biology, definitive structural data at atomic resolution are available for many macromolecules; however, information about the structure of the brain is much less complete, both in scope and resolution. Several technical developments over the past decade, such as serial block-face electron microscopy and trans-synaptic viral tracing, have made the structural biology of neural circuits conceivable: we may be able to obtain the structural information needed to reconstruct the network of cellular connections for large parts of, or even an entire, mouse brain within a decade or so. Given that the brain's algorithms are ultimately encoded by this network, knowing where all of these connections are should, at the very least, provide the data needed to distinguish between models of neural computation.","Cooling can reduce primary injury and prevent secondary injury to the brain after insults in certain clinical settings and in animal models of brain insult. The mechanisms that underlie the protective effects of cooling - also known as therapeutic hypothermia - are slowly beginning to be understood. Hypothermia influences multiple aspects of brain physiology in the acute, subacute and chronic stages of ischaemia. It affects pathways leading to excitotoxicity, apoptosis, inflammation and free radical production, as well as blood flow, metabolism and blood-brain barrier integrity. Hypothermia may also influence neurogenesis, gliogenesis and angiogenesis after injury. It is likely that no single factor can explain the neuroprotection provided by hypothermia, but understanding its myriad effects may shed light on important neuroprotective mechanisms.", , ,"The assembly of a new growth cone is a prerequisite for axon regeneration after injury. Creation of a new growth cone involves multiple processes, including calcium signalling, restructuring of the cytoskeleton, transport of materials, local translation of messenger RNAs and the insertion of new membrane and cell surface molecules. In axons that have an intrinsic ability to regenerate, these processes are executed in a timely fashion. However, in axons that lack regenerative capacity, such as those of the mammalian CNS, several of the steps that are required for regeneration fail, and these axons do not begin the growth process. Identification of the points of failure can suggest targets for promoting regeneration.","Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength occurs during learning and can last for long periods, making it a probable mechanism for memory storage. LTP induction results in calcium entry, which activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII subsequently translocates to the synapse, where it binds to NMDA-type glutamate receptors and produces potentiation by phosphorylating principal and auxiliary subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These processes are all localized to stimulated spines and account for the synapse-specificity of LTP. In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse.", , ,"Visual information is processed in the retina to a remarkable degree before it is transmitted to higher visual centres. Several types of retinal ganglion cells (the output neurons of the retina) respond preferentially to image motion in a particular direction, and each type of direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) is comprised of multiple subtypes with different preferred directions. The direction selectivity of the cells is generated by diverse mechanisms operating within microcircuits that rely on independent neuronal processing in individual dendrites of both the DSGCs and the presynaptic neurons that innervate them.","All cells use changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) to regulate cell signalling events. In neurons, with their elaborate dendritic and axonal arborizations, there are clear examples of both localized and widespread Ca(2+) signals. [Ca(2+)](i) changes that are generated by Ca(2+) entry through voltage- and ligand-gated channels are the best characterized. In addition, the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores can result in increased [Ca(2+)](i); the signals that trigger this release have been less well-studied, in part because they are not usually associated with specific changes in membrane potential. However, recent experiments have revealed dramatic widespread Ca(2+) waves and localized spark-like events, particularly in dendrites. Here we review emerging data on the nature of these signals and their functions.", , , , , ,"Schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities are best understood as spectrums of diseases that have broad sets of causes. However, it is becoming evident that these conditions also have overlapping phenotypes and genetics, which is suggestive of common deficits. In this context, the idea that the disruption of inhibitory circuits might be responsible for some of the clinical features of these disorders is gaining support. Recent studies in animal models demonstrate that the molecular basis of such disruption is linked to specific defects in the development and function of interneurons - the cells that are responsible for establishing inhibitory circuits in the brain. These insights are leading to a better understanding of the causes of schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities, and may contribute to the development of more-effective therapeutic interventions.", , , ,"For many years it has been assumed that the identity of the transmitters expressed by neurons is stable and unchanging. Recent work, however, shows that electrical activity can respecify neurotransmitter expression during development and in the mature nervous system, and an understanding is emerging of the molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent transmitter respecification. Changes in postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor expression accompany and match changes in transmitter specification, thus enabling synaptic transmission. The functional roles of neurotransmitter respecification are beginning to be understood and appear to involve homeostatic synaptic regulation, which in turn influences behaviour. Activation of this novel form of plasticity by sensorimotor stimuli may provide clinical benefits.","Successful ageing is determined in part by genetic background, but also by experiential factors associated with lifestyle and culture. Dietary, behavioural and pharmacological interventions have been identified as potential means to slow brain ageing and forestall neurodegenerative disease. Many of these interventions recruit adaptive cellular stress responses to strengthen neuronal networks and enhance plasticity. In this Science and Society article, we describe several determinants of healthy and pathological brain ageing, with insights into how these processes are accelerated or prevented. We also describe the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of exercise and nutritional interventions, with the goal of recruiting these molecular targets for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative disease.","Cognition results from interactions among functionally specialized but widely distributed brain regions; however, neuroscience has so far largely focused on characterizing the function of individual brain regions and neurons therein. Here we discuss recent studies that have instead investigated the interactions between brain regions during cognitive processes by assessing correlations between neuronal oscillations in different regions of the primate cerebral cortex. These studies have opened a new window onto the large-scale circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor decision-making and top-down attention. We propose that frequency-specific neuronal correlations in large-scale cortical networks may be 'fingerprints' of canonical neuronal computations underlying cognitive processes.", , ,Mitochondria have a number of essential roles in neuronal function. Their complex mobility patterns within neurons are characterized by frequent changes in direction. Mobile mitochondria can become stationary or pause in regions that have a high metabolic demand and can move again rapidly in response to physiological changes. Defects in mitochondrial transport are implicated in the pathogenesis of several major neurological disorders. Research into the mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial transport is thus an important emerging frontier.,"Speech production has been studied predominantly from within two traditions, psycholinguistics and motor control. These traditions have rarely interacted, and the resulting chasm between these approaches seems to reflect a level of analysis difference: whereas motor control is concerned with lower-level articulatory control, psycholinguistics focuses on higher-level linguistic processing. However, closer examination of both approaches reveals a substantial convergence of ideas. The goal of this article is to integrate psycholinguistic and motor control approaches to speech production. The result of this synthesis is a neuroanatomically grounded, hierarchical state feedback control model of speech production.", , , , ,"The physical distance between presynaptic Ca(2+) channels and the Ca(2+) sensors that trigger exocytosis of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles is a key determinant of the signalling properties of synapses in the nervous system. Recent functional analysis indicates that in some fast central synapses, transmitter release is triggered by a small number of Ca(2+) channels that are coupled to Ca(2+) sensors at the nanometre scale. Molecular analysis suggests that this tight coupling is generated by protein-protein interactions involving Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) sensors and various other synaptic proteins. Nanodomain coupling has several functional advantages, as it increases the efficacy, speed and energy efficiency of synaptic transmission.", , , , , ,"Mounting evidence suggests that acute and chronic stress, especially the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids, induces changes in glutamate neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, thereby influencing some aspects of cognitive processing. In addition, dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is increasingly considered to be a core feature of stress-related mental illnesses. Recent studies have shed light on the mechanisms by which stress and glucocorticoids affect glutamate transmission, including effects on glutamate release, glutamate receptors and glutamate clearance and metabolism. This new understanding provides insights into normal brain functioning, as well as the pathophysiology and potential new treatments of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.","Despite its clinical relevance, direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the human brain is surprisingly poorly understood. Although we understand several aspects of electrical stimulation at the cellular level, surface DES evokes a complex summation effect in a large volume of brain tissue, and the effect is difficult to predict as it depends on many local and remote physiological and morphological factors. The complex stimulation effects are reflected in the heterogeneity of behavioural effects that are induced by DES, which range from evocation to inhibition of responses - sometimes even when DES is applied at the same cortical site. Thus, it is a misconception that DES - in contrast to other neuroscience techniques - allows us to draw unequivocal conclusions about the role of stimulated brain areas.","RNA-binding proteins, and in particular TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), are central to the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases and related neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on human tissue have implicated several possible mechanisms of disease and experimental studies are now attempting to determine whether TDP43-mediated neurodegeneration results from a gain or a loss of function of the protein. In addition, the distinct possibility of pleotropic or combined effects - in which gains of toxic properties and losses of normal TDP43 functions act together - needs to be considered.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2013 Feb;14(2):152., , ,"The popular press is replete with stories about the effects of video and computer games on the brain. Sensationalist headlines claiming that video games 'damage the brain' or 'boost brain power' do not do justice to the complexities and limitations of the studies involved, and create a confusing overall picture about the effects of gaming on the brain. Here, six experts in the field shed light on our current understanding of the positive and negative ways in which playing video games can affect cognition and behaviour, and explain how this knowledge can be harnessed for educational and rehabilitation purposes. As research in this area is still in its early days, the contributors of this Viewpoint also discuss several issues and challenges that should be addressed to move the field forward.","Recent advances in our understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders has blown away the diagnostic boundaries that are defined by currently used diagnostic manuals. The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene was originally discovered at the breakpoint of an inherited chromosomal translocation, which segregates with major mental illnesses. In addition, many biological studies have indicated a role for DISC1 in early neurodevelopment and synaptic regulation. Given that DISC1 is thought to drive a range of endophenotypes that underlie major mental conditions, elucidating the biology of DISC1 may enable the construction of new diagnostic categories for mental illnesses with a more meaningful biological foundation.", , , , , ,"The neurovascular unit (NVU) comprises brain endothelial cells, pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells, glia and neurons. The NVU controls blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow, and maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal 'milieu', which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Recent evidence indicates that BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several vasculotoxic and neurotoxic molecules within brain parenchyma, a reduction in cerebral blood flow, and hypoxia. Together, these vascular-derived insults might initiate and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. This article examines mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's disease, and highlights therapeutic opportunities relating to these neurovascular deficits.","Virtual reality (VR) environments are increasingly being used by neuroscientists to simulate natural events and social interactions. VR creates interactive, multimodal sensory stimuli that offer unique advantages over other approaches to neuroscientific research and applications. VR's compatibility with imaging technologies such as functional MRI allows researchers to present multimodal stimuli with a high degree of ecological validity and control while recording changes in brain activity. Therapists, too, stand to gain from progress in VR technology, which provides a high degree of control over the therapeutic experience. Here we review the latest advances in VR technology and its applications in neuroscience research.",,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2014 Oct;15(10):631.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Jan;13(1):70; author reply 70.,"The loss of control over drug intake that occurs in addiction was initially believed to result from disruption of subcortical reward circuits. However, imaging studies in addictive behaviours have identified a key involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) both through its regulation of limbic reward regions and its involvement in higher-order executive function (for example, self-control, salience attribution and awareness). This Review focuses on functional neuroimaging studies conducted in the past decade that have expanded our understanding of the involvement of the PFC in drug addiction. Disruption of the PFC in addiction underlies not only compulsive drug taking but also accounts for the disadvantageous behaviours that are associated with addiction and the erosion of free will.","The hedonic properties of food can stimulate feeding behaviour even when energy requirements have been met, contributing to weight gain and obesity. Similarly, the hedonic effects of drugs of abuse can motivate their excessive intake, culminating in addiction. Common brain substrates regulate the hedonic properties of palatable food and addictive drugs, and recent reports suggest that excessive consumption of food or drugs of abuse induces similar neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuitries. Here, we review evidence suggesting that obesity and drug addiction may share common molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms.", , , ,"Investigations of long-term changes in brain structure and function that accompany chronic exposure to drugs of abuse suggest that alterations in gene regulation contribute substantially to the addictive phenotype. Here, we review multiple mechanisms by which drugs alter the transcriptional potential of genes. These mechanisms range from the mobilization or repression of the transcriptional machinery - including the transcription factors ΔFOSB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) - to epigenetics - including alterations in the accessibility of genes within their native chromatin structure induced by histone tail modifications and DNA methylation, and the regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs. Increasing evidence implicates these various mechanisms of gene regulation in the lasting changes that drugs of abuse induce in the brain, and offers novel inroads for addiction therapy.", , , , ,"The publication of the psychomotor stimulant theory of addiction in 1987 and the finding that addictive drugs increase dopamine concentrations in the rat mesolimbic system in 1988 have led to a predominance of psychobiological theories that consider addiction to opiates and addiction to psychostimulants as essentially identical phenomena. Indeed, current theories of addiction - hedonic allostasis, incentive sensitization, aberrant learning and frontostriatal dysfunction - all argue for a unitary account of drug addiction. This view is challenged by behavioural, cognitive and neurobiological findings in laboratory animals and humans. Here, we argue that opiate addiction and psychostimulant addiction are behaviourally and neurobiologically distinct and that the differences have important implications for addiction treatment, addiction theories and future research.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Dec;12(12):769; author reply 769.,"Migraine is a common and complex brain disorder. Although it is clear that head pain is a key manifestation of the disorder for most patients, what drives the activation of neuronal pain pathways in susceptible patients is less obvious. There is growing evidence that migraine pathophysiology may, in part, include dysfunction of subcortical structures. These include diencephalic and brainstem nuclei that can modulate the perception of activation of the trigeminovascular system, which carries sensory information from the cranial vasculature to the brain. Dysfunction of these nuclei, and their connections to other key brain centres, may contribute to the cascade of events that results in other symptoms of migraine - such as light and sound sensitivity - thus providing a comprehensive explanation of the neurobiology of the disorder.", , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Jan;13(1):70., , ,"Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function as part of a central timing circuit that drives daily changes in our behaviour and underlying physiology. A hallmark feature of SCN neuronal populations is that they are mostly electrically silent during the night, start to fire action potentials near dawn and then continue to generate action potentials with a slow and steady pace all day long. Sets of currents are responsible for this daily rhythm, with the strongest evidence for persistent Na(+) currents, L-type Ca(2+) currents, hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(H)), large-conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) (BK) currents and fast delayed rectifier (FDR) K(+) currents. These rhythms in electrical activity are crucial for the function of the circadian timing system, including the expression of clock genes, and decline with ageing and disease. This article reviews our current understanding of the ionic and molecular mechanisms that drive the rhythmic firing patterns in the SCN.", , , , ,"The neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are evolutionarily highly conserved mediators in the regulation of complex social cognition and behaviour. Recent studies have investigated the effects of OXT and AVP on human social interaction, the genetic mechanisms of inter-individual variation in social neuropeptide signalling and the actions of OXT and AVP in the human brain as revealed by neuroimaging. These data have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which these neuropeptides contribute to human social behaviour. OXT and AVP are emerging as targets for novel treatment approaches--particularly in synergistic combination with psychotherapy--for mental disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as autism, social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia.", , , , , , ,"The brain continuously adapts its processing machinery to behavioural demands. To achieve this, it rapidly modulates the operating mode of cortical circuits, controlling the way that information is transformed and routed. This article will focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.", ,"Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumour and are often fast growing with a poor prognosis for the patient. Their complex cellular composition, diffuse invasiveness and capacity to escape therapies has challenged researchers for decades and hampered progress towards an effective treatment. Recent molecular characterization of tumour cells combined with new insights into cellular diversification that occurs during development, and the modelling of these processes in transgenic animals have enabled a more detailed understanding of the events that underlie gliomagenesis. Combining this enhanced understanding of the relationship between neural stem cell biology and the cell lineage relationships of tumour cells with model systems offers new opportunities to develop specific and effective therapies.","Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating illness that affects many people. It has been marred by controversy, from initial scepticism in the medical community about the existence of the condition itself to continuing disagreements--mainly between some patient advocacy groups on one side, and researchers and physicians on the other--about the name for the illness, its aetiology, its pathophysiology and the effectiveness of the few currently available treatments. The role of the CNS in the disease is central in many of these discussions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked four scientists involved in CFS research about their views on the condition, its causes and the future of research aimed at improving our understanding of this chronic illness.", , ,"A growing number of studies point to rapamycin as a pharmacological compound that is able to provide neuroprotection in several experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. In addition, rapamycin exerts strong anti-ageing effects in several species, including mammals. By inhibiting the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), rapamycin influences a variety of essential cellular processes, such as cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis and autophagy. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of rapamycin and discuss the therapeutic potential of this compound for neurodegenerative diseases.", , , , , ,"The concept that the gut and the brain are closely connected, and that this interaction plays an important part not only in gastrointestinal function but also in certain feeling states and in intuitive decision making, is deeply rooted in our language. Recent neurobiological insights into this gut-brain crosstalk have revealed a complex, bidirectional communication system that not only ensures the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal homeostasis and digestion but is likely to have multiple effects on affect, motivation and higher cognitive functions, including intuitive decision making. Moreover, disturbances of this system have been implicated in a wide range of disorders, including functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, obesity and eating disorders.","In the 40 years since Aaron Beck first proposed his cognitive model of depression, the elements of this model--biased attention, biased processing, biased thoughts and rumination, biased memory, and dysfunctional attitudes and schemas--have been consistently linked with the onset and maintenance of depression. Although numerous studies have examined the neural mechanisms that underlie the cognitive aspects of depression, their findings have not been integrated with Beck's cognitive model. In this Review, we identify the functional and structural neurobiological architecture of Beck's cognitive model of depression. Although the mechanisms underlying each element of the model differ, in general the negative cognitive biases in depression are facilitated by increased influence from subcortical emotion processing regions combined with attenuated top-down cognitive control.", , , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Oct;12(10):612; author reply 612.,"The variability of the postsynaptic response following a single action potential arises from two sources: the neurotransmitter release is probabilistic, and the postsynaptic response to neurotransmitter release has variable timing and amplitude. At individual synapses, the number of molecules of a given type that are involved in these processes is small enough that the stochastic (random) properties of molecular events cannot be neglected. How the stochasticity of molecular processes contributes to the variability of synaptic transmission, its sensitivity and its robustness to molecular fluctuations has important implications for our understanding of the mechanistic basis of synaptic transmission and of synaptic plasticity.", , ,"Macrophages from the peripheral circulation and those derived from resident microglia are among the main effector cells of the inflammatory response that follows spinal cord trauma. There has been considerable debate in the field as to whether the inflammatory response is good or bad for tissue protection and repair. Recent studies on macrophage polarization in non-neural tissues have shed much light on their changing functional states. In the context of this literature, we discuss the activation of macrophages and microglia following spinal cord injury, and their effects on repair. Harnessing their anti-inflammatory properties could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for spinal cord trauma.", , , , ,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Nov;12(11):700; author reply 700.,"Alcohol-related violence is a serious and common social problem. Moreover, violent behaviour is much more common in alcohol-dependent individuals. Animal experiments and human studies have provided insights into the acute effect of alcohol on aggressive behaviour and into common factors underlying acute and chronic alcohol intake and aggression. These studies have shown that environmental factors, such as early-life stress, interact with genetic variations in serotonin-related genes that affect serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. This leads to increased amygdala activity and impaired prefrontal function that, together, predispose to both increased alcohol intake and impulsive aggression. In addition, acute and chronic alcohol intake can further impair executive control and thereby facilitate aggressive behaviour.", , ,"Ageing is the greatest risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. However, the current dogma holds that cellular mechanisms that are associated with ageing of midbrain dopamine neurons and those that are related to dopamine neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease are unrelated. We propose, based on evidence from studies of non-human primates, that normal ageing and the degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease are linked by the same cellular mechanisms and, therefore, that markers of cellular risk factors accumulate with age in a pattern that mimics the pattern of degeneration observed in Parkinson's disease. We contend that ageing induces a pre-parkinsonian state, and that the cellular mechanisms of dopamine neuron demise during normal ageing are accelerated or exaggerated in Parkinson's disease through a combination of genetic and environmental factors.","The nervous system is protected by barriers that restrict the invasion of pathogens. Nevertheless, mechanisms have evolved by which microbes can pass these barriers, enter and exit neurons and target various regions of the nervous system. In the brain, immune responses to pathogens are generally not robust, so microbes can hide and survive or, conversely, cause severe uncontrolled infections. Depending on their sites of entry and the regions that they target, microbes can cause diverse nervous system dysfunctions and even influence host behaviour to their own advantage. This Review discusses routes by which microbes can reach the nervous system and cause persistent or life-threatening infections.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Aug;12(8):484., , , ,"Neurons are generally considered to communicate information by increasing or decreasing their firing rate. However, in principle, they could in addition convey messages by using specific spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activities and silent intervals. Here, we review expanding lines of evidence that such spatiotemporal coding occurs in the cerebellum, and that the olivocerebellar system is optimally designed to generate and employ precise patterns of complex spikes and simple spikes during the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills. These spatiotemporal patterns may complement rate coding, thus enabling precise control of motor and cognitive processing at a high spatiotemporal resolution by fine-tuning sensorimotor integration and coordination.", , , , ,"As the global financial downturn continues, its impact on neuroscientists - both on an individual level and at the level of their research institute - becomes increasingly apparent. How is the economic crisis affecting neuroscience funding, career prospects, international collaborations and scientists' morale in different parts of the world? Nature Reviews Neuroscience gauged the opinions of a number of leading neuroscientists: the President of the Society for Neuroscience, the President Elect of the British Neuroscience Association, the former President of the Japan Neuroscience Society, the President of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and the Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health. Their responses provide interesting and important insights into the regional impact of the global financial downturn, with some causes for optimism for the future of neuroscience research.","The Notch pathway is often regarded as a developmental pathway, but components of Notch signalling are expressed and active in the adult brain. With the advent of more sophisticated genetic manipulations, evidence has emerged that suggests both conserved and novel roles for Notch signalling in the adult brain. Not surprisingly, Notch is a key regulator of adult neural stem cells, but it is increasingly clear that Notch signalling also has roles in the regulation of migration, morphology, synaptic plasticity and survival of immature and mature neurons. Understanding the many functions of Notch signalling in the adult brain, and its dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and malignancy, is crucial to the development of new therapeutics that are centred around this pathway.","Nerve cell development in the brain is a tightly regulated process. The generation of neurons from precursor cells, their migration to the appropriate target sites, their extensive arborization and their integration into functional networks through synapse formation and refinement are governed by multiple interdependent signalling cascades. The function and turnover of proteins involved in these signalling cascades, in turn, are spatially and temporally controlled by ubiquitylation. Recent advances have provided first insights into the highly complex and intricate molecular pathways that regulate ubiquitylation during all stages of neural development and that operate in parallel with other regulatory processes such as phosphorylation or cyclic nucleotide signalling.", , , , , , , ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Aug;12(8):484., , , , , , , , ,"The division of cortical visual processing into distinct dorsal and ventral streams is a key framework that has guided visual neuroscience. The characterization of the ventral stream as a 'What' pathway is relatively uncontroversial, but the nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear. Originally proposed as mediating spatial perception ('Where'), more recent accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action ('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation, respectively.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Jul;12(7):425.,"Inter-individual variability in perception, thought and action is frequently treated as a source of 'noise' in scientific investigations of the neural mechanisms that underlie these processes, and discarded by averaging data from a group of participants. However, recent MRI studies in the human brain show that inter-individual variability in a wide range of basic and higher cognitive functions - including perception, motor control, memory, aspects of consciousness and the ability to introspect - can be predicted from the local structure of grey and white matter as assessed by voxel-based morphometry or diffusion tensor imaging. We propose that inter-individual differences can be used as a source of information to link human behaviour and cognition to brain anatomy.","Graded distributions of extracellular cues guide developing axons toward their targets. A network of second messengers - Ca(2+) and cyclic nucleotides - shapes cue-derived information into either attractive or repulsive signals that steer growth cones bidirectionally. Emerging evidence suggests that such guidance signals create a localized imbalance between exocytosis and endocytosis, which in turn redirects membrane, adhesion and cytoskeletal components asymmetrically across the growth cone to bias the direction of axon extension. These recent advances allow us to propose a unifying model of how the growth cone translates shallow gradients of environmental information into polarized activity of the steering machinery for axon guidance.","The delivery of many potentially therapeutic and diagnostic compounds to specific areas of the brain is restricted by brain barriers, of which the most well known are the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Recent studies have shown numerous additional roles of these barriers, including an involvement in neurodevelopment, in the control of cerebral blood flow, and--when barrier integrity is impaired--in the pathology of many common CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.","It has been argued that emotion, pain and cognitive control are functionally segregated in distinct subdivisions of the cingulate cortex. However, recent observations encourage a fundamentally different view. Imaging studies demonstrate that negative affect, pain and cognitive control activate an overlapping region of the dorsal cingulate--the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). Anatomical studies reveal that the aMCC constitutes a hub where information about reinforcers can be linked to motor centres responsible for expressing affect and executing goal-directed behaviour. Computational modelling and other kinds of evidence suggest that this intimacy reflects control processes that are common to all three domains. These observations compel a reconsideration of the dorsal cingulate's contribution to negative affect and pain.","Mechanisms that ensure robust long-term performance of synaptic transmission over a wide range of activity are crucial for the integrity of neuronal networks, for processing sensory information and for the ability to learn and store memories. Recent experiments have revealed that such robust performance requires a tight coupling between exocytic vesicle fusion at defined release sites and endocytic retrieval of synaptic vesicle membranes. Distinct presynaptic scaffolding proteins are essential for fulfilling this requirement, providing either ultrastructural coordination or acting as signalling hubs.","The somatosensory system mediates fundamental physiological functions, including the senses of touch, pain and proprioception. This variety of functions is matched by a diverse array of mechanosensory neurons that respond to force in a specific fashion. Mechanotransduction begins at the sensory nerve endings, which rapidly transform mechanical forces into electrical signals. Progress has been made in establishing the functional properties of mechanoreceptors, but it has been remarkably difficult to characterize mechanotranducer channels at the molecular level. However, in the past few years, new functional assays have provided insights into the basic properties and molecular identity of mechanotransducer channels in mammalian sensory neurons. The recent identification of novel families of proteins as mechanosensing molecules will undoubtedly accelerate our understanding of mechanotransduction mechanisms in mammalian somatosensation.","In recent years, studies ranging from single-unit recordings in animals to electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies in humans have demonstrated the pivotal role of phase synchronization in memory processes. Phase synchronization - here referring to the synchronization of oscillatory phases between different brain regions - supports both working memory and long-term memory and acts by facilitating neural communication and by promoting neural plasticity. There is evidence that processes underlying working and long-term memory might interact in the medial temporal lobe. We propose that this is accomplished by neural operations involving phase-phase and phase-amplitude synchronization. A deeper understanding of how phase synchronization supports the flexibility of and interaction between memory systems may yield new insights into the functions of phase synchronization in general.","Astrocyte-like cells, which act as stem cells in the adult brain, reside in a few restricted stem cell niches. However, following brain injury, glia outside these niches acquire or reactivate stem cell potential as part of reactive gliosis. Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular pathways involved in this process. A comparison of molecular pathways activated after injury with those involved in the normal neural stem cell niches highlights strategies that could overcome the inhibition of neurogenesis outside the stem cell niche and instruct parenchymal glia towards a neurogenic fate. This new view on reactive glia therefore suggests a widespread endogenous source of cells with stem cell potential, which might potentially be harnessed for local repair strategies.","G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in numerous key neurotransmitter systems in the brain that are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). GPCRs also directly influence the amyloid cascade through modulation of the α-, β- and γ-secretases, proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and regulation of amyloid-β degradation. Additionally, amyloid-β has been shown to perturb GPCR function. Emerging insights into the mechanistic link between GPCRs and AD highlight the potential of this class of receptors as a therapeutic target for AD.", ,"Amyloid-β and tau are the two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Although both amyloid-β and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of amyloid-β. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β toxicity.","A broad body of experimental work has demonstrated that apparently spontaneous brain activity is not random. At the level of large-scale neural systems, as measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the emerging RSNs. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations around a stable anatomical skeleton.","The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation asserts that the induction of synaptic potentiation creates only the potential for a lasting change in synaptic efficacy, but not the commitment to such a change. Other neural activity, before or after induction, can also determine whether persistent change occurs. Recent findings, leading us to revise the original hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local, synapse-specific 'tagged' state and the expression of long-term potentiation are dissociable. Additional observations suggest that there are major differences in the mechanisms of functional and structural plasticity. These advances call for a revised theory that incorporates the specific molecular and structural processes involved. Addressing the physiological relevance of previous in vitro findings, new behavioural studies have experimentally translated the hypothesis to learning and the consolidation of newly formed memories.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Feb;12(2):118.,"Most of the molecular mechanisms contributing to long-term memory have been found to consolidate information within a brief time window after learning, but not to maintain information during memory storage. However, with the discovery that synaptic long-term potentiation is maintained by the persistently active protein kinase, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a possible mechanism of memory storage has been identified. Recent research shows how PKMζ might perpetuate information both at synapses and during long-term memory.","Declarative and emotional memories are key to quality of life and day-to-day functioning. The absence of memory or the inability to recall memories properly in an emotional context leads to dysfunction but, paradoxically, memories that generate too much emotion can be equally disabling.","Parkinson's disease, like many common age-related conditions, is now recognized to have a substantial genetic component. Here, I discuss how mutations in a large complex gene--leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)--affect protein function, and I review recent evidence that LRRK2 mutations affect pathways that involve other proteins that have been implicated in Parkinson's disease, specifically α-synuclein and tau. These concepts can be used to understand disease processes and to develop therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","Neurons in the spinal dorsal horn process sensory information, which is then transmitted to several brain regions, including those responsible for pain perception. The dorsal horn provides numerous potential targets for the development of novel analgesics and is thought to undergo changes that contribute to the exaggerated pain felt after nerve injury and inflammation. Despite its obvious importance, we still know little about the neuronal circuits that process sensory information, mainly because of the heterogeneity of the various neuronal components that make up these circuits. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the neuronal organization and circuitry of this complex region.","The membrane protein Nogo-A was initially characterized as a CNS-specific inhibitor of axonal regeneration. Recent studies have uncovered regulatory roles of Nogo proteins and their receptors--in precursor migration, neurite growth and branching in the developing nervous system--as well as a growth-restricting function during CNS maturation. The function of Nogo in the adult CNS is now understood to be that of a negative regulator of neuronal growth, leading to stabilization of the CNS wiring at the expense of extensive plastic rearrangements and regeneration after injury. In addition, Nogo proteins interact with various intracellular components and may have roles in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, processing of amyloid precursor protein and cell survival.","Sensory synapses of the visual and auditory systems must faithfully encode a wide dynamic range of graded signals, and must be capable of sustained transmitter release over long periods of time. Functionally and morphologically, these sensory synapses are unique: their active zones are specialized in several ways for sustained, rapid vesicle exocytosis, but their most striking feature is an organelle called the synaptic ribbon, which is a proteinaceous structure that extends into the cytoplasm at the active zone and tethers a large pool of releasable vesicles. But precisely how does the ribbon function to support tonic release at these synapses? Recent genetic and biophysical advances have begun to open the 'black box' of the synaptic ribbon with some surprising findings and promise to resolve its function in vision and hearing.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Jul;12(7):425; author reply 425.,"Vocal imitation in human infants and in some orders of birds relies on auditory-guided motor learning during a sensitive period of development. It proceeds from 'babbling' (in humans) and 'subsong' (in birds) through distinct phases towards the full-fledged communication system. Language development and birdsong learning have parallels at the behavioural, neural and genetic levels. Different orders of birds have evolved networks of brain regions for song learning and production that have a surprisingly similar gross anatomy, with analogies to human cortical regions and basal ganglia. Comparisons between different songbird species and humans point towards both general and species-specific principles of vocal learning and have identified common neural and molecular substrates, including the forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) gene.","Recent studies have deepened our understanding of multiple mechanisms by which extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules regulate various aspects of synaptic plasticity and have strengthened a link between the ECM and learning and memory. New findings also support the view that the ECM is important for homeostatic processes, such as scaling of synaptic responses, metaplasticity and stabilization of synaptic connectivity. Activity-dependent modification of the ECM affects the formation of dendritic filopodia and the growth of dendritic spines. Thus, the ECM has a dual role as a promoter of structural and functional plasticity and as a degradable stabilizer of neural microcircuits. Both of these aspects are likely to be important for mental health.","Progressive loss of the ascending dopaminergic projection in the basal ganglia is a fundamental pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Studies in animals and humans have identified spatially segregated functional territories in the basal ganglia for the control of goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior putamen, a region of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual behaviour. These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on the goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control owing to distorting output signals from habitual control circuits, which impede the expression of goal-directed action.","To celebrate the first 10 years of Nature Reviews Neuroscience, we invited the authors of the most cited article of each year to look back on the state of their field of research at the time of publication and the impact their article has had, and to discuss the questions that might be answered in the next 10 years. This selection of highly cited articles provides interesting snapshots of the progress that has been made in diverse areas of neuroscience. They show the enormous influence of neuroimaging techniques and highlight concepts that have generated substantial interest in the past decade, such as neuroimmunology, social neuroscience and the 'network approach' to brain function. These advancements will pave the way for further exciting discoveries that lie ahead.","The classical concept of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) homeostasis comprises a feedback system within which circulating levels of glucocorticoid hormones maintain the brain and body in an optimal steady state. However, studies involving new techniques for investigating the real-time dynamics of both glucocorticoid hormones and glucocorticoid receptor function paint a different picture--namely, of continuous dynamic equilibration throughout this neuroendocrine system. This dynamic state is dictated by feedforward and feedback regulatory loops and by stochastic interactions at the level of DNA binding. We propose that this continuous oscillatory activity is crucial for optimal responsiveness of glucocorticoid-sensitive neural processes.","There is a long-standing paradox that NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) can both promote neuronal health and kill neurons. Recent studies show that NMDAR-induced responses depend on the receptor location: stimulation of synaptic NMDARs, acting primarily through nuclear Ca(2+) signalling, leads to the build-up of a neuroprotective 'shield', whereas stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDARs promotes cell death. These differences result from the activation of distinct genomic programmes and from opposing actions on intracellular signalling pathways. Perturbations in the balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR activity contribute to neuronal dysfunction in acute ischaemia and Huntington's disease, and could be a common theme in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroprotective therapies should aim to both enhance the effect of synaptic activity and disrupt extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent death signalling.","The acquisition and consolidation of memories of stressful events is modulated by glucocorticoids, a type of corticosteroid hormone that is released in high levels from the adrenal glands after exposure to a stressful event. These effects occur through activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of glucocorticoids on synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory have recently begun to be identified. Glucocorticoids regulate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate) receptor trafficking--which is crucially involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity--both rapidly and persistently. Stress hormones may, through modulation of AMPA receptor function, promote the consolidation of behaviourally relevant information.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 May;12(5):302; author reply 302.,"Human brain development occurs within a socioeconomic context and childhood socioeconomic status (SES) influences neural development--particularly of the systems that subserve language and executive function. Research in humans and in animal models has implicated prenatal factors, parent-child interactions and cognitive stimulation in the home environment in the effects of SES on neural development. These findings provide a unique opportunity for understanding how environmental factors can lead to individual differences in brain development, and for improving the programmes and policies that are designed to alleviate SES-related disparities in mental health and academic achievement.","The brain is a highly modular structure. To exploit modularity, it is necessary that spiking activity can propagate from one module to another while preserving the information it carries. Therefore, reliable propagation is one of the key properties of a candidate neural code. Surprisingly, the conditions under which spiking activity can be propagated have received comparatively little attention in the experimental literature. By contrast, several computational studies in the last decade have addressed this issue. Using feedforward networks (FFNs) as a generic network model, they have identified two dynamical activity modes that support the propagation of either asynchronous (rate code) or synchronous (temporal code) spiking. Here, we review the dichotomy of asynchronous and synchronous propagation in FFNs, propose their integration into a single extended conceptual framework and suggest experimental strategies to test our hypothesis.","After a pause of nearly 40 years in research into the effects of psychedelic drugs, recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and ketamine have led to renewed interest in the clinical potential of psychedelics in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. Recent behavioural and neuroimaging data show that psychedelics modulate neural circuits that have been implicated in mood and affective disorders, and can reduce the clinical symptoms of these disorders. These findings raise the possibility that research into psychedelics might identify novel therapeutic mechanisms and approaches that are based on glutamate-driven neuroplasticity.","The stimulus complexity of naturally occurring odours presents unique challenges for central nervous systems that are aiming to internalize the external olfactory landscape. One mechanism by which the brain encodes perceptual representations of behaviourally relevant smells is through the synthesis of different olfactory inputs into a unified perceptual experience--an odour object. Recent evidence indicates that the identification, categorization and discrimination of olfactory stimuli rely on the formation and modulation of odour objects in the piriform cortex. Convergent findings from human and rodent models suggest that distributed piriform ensemble patterns of olfactory qualities and categories are crucial for maintaining the perceptual constancy of ecologically inconstant stimuli.","The effects of music training in relation to brain plasticity have caused excitement, evident from the popularity of books on this topic among scientists and the general public. Neuroscience research has shown that music training leads to changes throughout the auditory system that prime musicians for listening challenges beyond music processing. This effect of music training suggests that, akin to physical exercise and its impact on body fitness, music is a resource that tones the brain for auditory fitness. Therefore, the role of music in shaping individual development deserves consideration.","There has been considerable progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that contribute to memory formation and the generation of circadian rhythms. However, it is not well understood how these two processes interact to generate long-term memory. Recent studies in both vertebrate and invertebrate models have shown time-of-day effects on neurophysiology and memory formation, and have revealed a possible role for cycling molecules in memory persistence. Together, these studies suggest that common mechanisms underlie circadian rhythmicity and long-term memory formation.","In the developing vertebrate retina, diverse neuronal subtypes originate from multipotent progenitors in a conserved order and are integrated into an intricate laminated architecture. Recent progress in mammalian photoreceptor development has identified a complex relationship between six key transcription-regulatory factors (RORbeta, OTX2, NRL, CRX, NR2E3 and TRbeta2) that determine rod versus M cone or S cone cell fate. We propose a step-wise 'transcriptional dominance' model of photoreceptor cell fate determination, with the S cone representing the default state of a generic photoreceptor precursor. Elucidation of gene-regulatory networks that dictate photoreceptor genesis and homeostasis will have wider implications for understanding the development of nervous system function and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","Recent evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins and their upstream and downstream regulators have key roles in many fundamental processes during neurodevelopment. Disruption of GSK3 signalling adversely affects brain development and is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which GSK3 activity is regulated in the nervous system and provide an overview of the recent advances in the understanding of how GSK3 signalling controls neurogenesis, neuronal polarization and axon growth during brain development. These recent advances suggest that GSK3 is a crucial node that mediates various cellular processes that are controlled by multiple signalling molecules--for example, disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), partitioning defective homologue 3 (PAR3), PAR6 and Wnt proteins--that regulate neurodevelopment.", ,Comment on Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Aug;11(8):605; author reply 605. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Feb;11(2):127-38.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption are frequently observed in patients with psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disease. The abnormal sleep that is experienced by these patients is largely assumed to be the product of medication or some other influence that is not well defined. However, normal brain function and the generation of sleep are linked by common neurotransmitter systems and regulatory pathways. Disruption of sleep alters sleep-wake timing, destabilizes physiology and promotes a range of pathologies (from cognitive to metabolic defects) that are rarely considered to be associated with abnormal sleep. We propose that brain disorders and abnormal sleep have a common mechanistic origin and that many co-morbid pathologies that are found in brain disease arise from a destabilization of sleep mechanisms. The stabilization of sleep may be a means by which to reduce the symptoms of--and permit early intervention of--psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease.","Ion channel clustering at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier has been suggested to be a key evolutionary innovation that enabled the development of the complex vertebrate nervous system. This innovation epitomizes a signature feature of neurons, namely polarity. The mechanisms that establish neuronal polarity, channel clustering and axon-dendrite identity during development are becoming clearer. However, much less is known about how polarity is maintained throughout life. Here, I review the role of the AIS in the development and maintenance of neuronal polarity and discuss how disrupted polarity may be a common component of many diseases and injuries that affect the nervous system.", , , , , , , ,"Surviving in a world with hidden rewards and dangers requires choosing the appropriate behaviours. Recent discoveries indicate that the habenula plays a prominent part in such behavioural choice through its effects on neuromodulator systems, in particular the dopamine and serotonin systems. By inhibiting dopamine-releasing neurons, habenula activation leads to the suppression of motor behaviour when an animal fails to obtain a reward or anticipates an aversive outcome. Moreover, the habenula is involved in behavioural responses to pain, stress, anxiety, sleep and reward, and its dysfunction is associated with depression, schizophrenia and drug-induced psychosis. As a highly conserved structure in the brain, the habenula provides a fundamental mechanism for both survival and decision-making.","Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown aetiology that affects 1 in 100-150 individuals. Diagnosis is based on three categories of behavioural criteria: abnormal social interactions, communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Strong evidence for a genetic basis has prompted the development of mouse models with targeted mutations in candidate genes for autism. As the diagnostic criteria for autism are behavioural, phenotyping these mouse models requires behavioural assays with high relevance to each category of the diagnostic symptoms. Behavioural neuroscientists are generating a comprehensive set of assays for social interaction, communication and repetitive behaviours to test hypotheses about the causes of autism. Robust phenotypes in mouse models hold great promise as translational tools for discovering effective treatments for components of autism spectrum disorders.","Long-term depression (LTD) in the CNS has been the subject of intense investigation as a process that may be involved in learning and memory and in various pathological conditions. Several mechanistically distinct forms of this type of synaptic plasticity have been identified and their molecular mechanisms are starting to be unravelled. Most studies have focused on forms of LTD that are triggered by synaptic activation of either NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Converging evidence supports a crucial role of LTD in some types of learning and memory and in situations in which cognitive demands require a flexible response. In addition, LTD may underlie the cognitive effects of acute stress, the addictive potential of some drugs of abuse and the elimination of synapses in neurodegenerative diseases.","Prominent models of human long-term memory distinguish between memory systems on the basis of whether learning and retrieval occur consciously or unconsciously. Episodic memory formation requires the rapid encoding of associations between different aspects of an event which, according to these models, depends on the hippocampus and on consciousness. However, recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus mediates rapid associative learning with and without consciousness in humans and animals, for long-term and short-term retention. Consciousness seems to be a poor criterion for differentiating between declarative (or explicit) and non declarative (or implicit) types of memory. A new model is therefore required in which memory systems are distinguished based on the processing operations involved rather than by consciousness.","The vast computational power of the brain has traditionally been viewed as arising from the complex connectivity of neural networks, in which an individual neuron acts as a simple linear summation and thresholding device. However, recent studies show that individual neurons utilize a wealth of nonlinear mechanisms to transform synaptic input into output firing. These mechanisms can arise from synaptic plasticity, synaptic noise, and somatic and dendritic conductances. This tool kit of nonlinear mechanisms confers considerable computational power on both morphologically simple and more complex neurons, enabling them to perform a range of arithmetic operations on signals encoded ina variety of different ways.","Discoveries in fruit flies have greatly contributed to our understanding of neuroscience. The use of an unparalleled wealth of tools, many of which originated between 1910–1960, has enabled milestone discoveries in nervous system development and function. Such findings have triggered and guided many research efforts in vertebrate neuroscience. After 100 years, fruit flies continue to be the choice model system for many neuroscientists. The combinational use of powerful research tools will ensure that this model organism will continue to lead to key discoveries that will impact vertebrate neuroscience.", , ,"Recent studies are beginning to paint a clear and consistent picture of the impairments in psychological and cognitive competencies that are associated with microdeletions in chromosome 22q11.2. These studies have highlighted a strong link between this genetic lesion and schizophrenia. Parallel studies in humans and animal models are starting to uncover the complex genetic and neural substrates altered by the microdeletion. In addition to offering a deeper understanding of the effects of this genetic lesion, these findings may guide analysis of other copy-number variants associated with cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.","The past decades have seen a revolution in our understanding of brain diseases and in particular of drug addiction. This has been largely due to the identification of neurotransmitter receptors and the development of animal models, which together have enabled the investigation of brain functions from the molecular to the cognitive level. Tobacco smoking, the principal - yet avoidable - cause of lung cancer is associated with nicotine addiction. Recent studies in mice involving deletion and replacement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits have begun to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and might offer new therapeutic strategies to treat this addiction.","The temporally and spatially restricted nature of the differentiation capacity of cells in the neural lineage has been studied extensively in recent years. Epigenetic control of developmental genes, which is heritable through cell divisions, has emerged as a key mechanism defining the differentiation potential of cells. Short-term or reversible repression of developmental genes puts them in a 'poised state', ready to be activated in response to differentiation-inducing cues, whereas long-term or permanent repression of developmental genes restricts the cell fates they regulate. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that underlie the establishment and regulation of differentiation potential along the neural lineage during development.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Oct;11(10):726.,"Much of the original historical data behind the greatest discoveries in neuroscience are now lost. However, a recently rediscovered box of histological slides belonging to Sir Charles Sherrington, a pioneer in spinal cord and motor control research, has survived at the University of Oxford since 1936. Sherrington coined the term 'synapse', developed the concept of inhibition in neuronal function, demonstrated the integration of sensory and motor actions of the nervous system, and examined the synaptic activity of single neurons and their integration into neuronal circuits. Here, we explore Sherrington's lifetime of discoveries, with reference to histological specimens from his box of slides.","In ageing populations, neurodegenerative diseases increase in prevalence, exacting an enormous toll on individuals and their communities. Multiple complementary experimental approaches are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these complex diseases and to develop novel therapeutics. Here, we describe why the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a unique role in the neurodegeneration armamentarium. As the best-understood and most readily analysed eukaryotic organism, S. cerevisiae is delivering mechanistic insights into cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration at an interactome-wide scale.", ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jun;11(6):449.,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels hyperpolarize neurons in response to activation of many different G protein-coupled receptors and thus control the excitability of neurons through GIRK-mediated self-inhibition, slow synaptic potentials and volume transmission. GIRK channel function and trafficking are highly dependent on the channel subunit composition. Pharmacological investigations of GIRK channels and studies in animal models suggest that GIRK activity has an important role in physiological responses, including pain perception and memory modulation. Moreover, abnormal GIRK function has been implicated in altering neuronal excitability and cell death, which may be important in the pathophysiology of diseases such as epilepsy, Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. GIRK channels may therefore prove to be a valuable new therapeutic target.","Action and perception are functionally linked in the brain, but a hotly debated question is whether perception and comprehension of stimuli depend on motor circuits. Brain language mechanisms are ideal for addressing this question. Neuroimaging investigations have found specific motor activations when subjects understand speech sounds, word meanings and sentence structures. Moreover, studies involving transcranial magnetic stimulation and patients with lesions affecting inferior frontal regions of the brain have shown contributions of motor circuits to the comprehension of phonemes, semantic categories and grammar. These data show that language comprehension benefits from frontocentral action systems, indicating that action and perception circuits are interdependent.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jun;11(6):449.,"The integration of adult-born neurons into the circuitry of the adult hippocampus suggests an important role for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, but its specific function in these processes has remained elusive. In this article, we summarize recent progress in this area, including advances based on behavioural studies and insights provided by computational modelling. Increasingly, evidence suggests that newborn neurons might be involved in hippocampal functions that are particularly dependent on the dentate gyrus, such as pattern separation. Furthermore, newborn neurons at different maturation stages may make distinct contributions to learning and memory. In particular, computational studies suggest that, before newborn neurons are fully mature, they might function as a pattern integrator by introducing a degree of similarity to the encoding of events that occur closely in time.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has devastating acute effects and in many cases seems to initiate long-term neurodegeneration. Indeed, an epidemiological association between TBI and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques — one of the hallmarks of AD — may be found in patients within hours following TBI. Here, we explore the mechanistic underpinnings of the link between TBI and AD, focusing on the hypothesis that rapid Aβ plaque formation may result from the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein in damaged axons and a disturbed balance between Aβ genesis and catabolism following TBI.","Synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie learning and memory, but the complexity of the interactions between the ion channels, enzymes and genes that are involved in synaptic plasticity impedes a deep understanding of this phenomenon. Computer modelling has been used to investigate the information processing that is performed by the signalling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity in principal neurons of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. In the past few years, new software developments that combine computational neuroscience techniques with systems biology techniques have allowed large-scale, kinetic models of the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We highlight important advancements produced by these quantitative modelling efforts and introduce promising approaches that use advancements in live-cell imaging.","In the past 20 years, an extra layer of information processing, in addition to that provided by neurons, has been proposed for the CNS. Neuronally evoked increases of the intracellular calcium concentration in astrocytes have been suggested to trigger exocytotic release of the 'gliotransmitters' glutamate, ATP and D-serine. These are proposed to modulate neuronal excitability and transmitter release, and to have a role in diseases as diverse as stroke, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and HIV infection. However, there is intense controversy about whether astrocytes can exocytose transmitters in vivo. Resolving this issue would considerably advance our understanding of brain function.","In addition to their role in providing myelin for rapid impulse propagation, the glia that ensheath long axons are required for the maintenance of normal axon transport and long-term survival. This presumably ancestral function seems to be independent of myelin membrane wrapping. Here, I propose that ensheathing glia provide trophic support to axons that are metabolically isolated, and that myelin itself might cause such isolation. This glial support of axonal integrity may be relevant for a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jun;11(6):449. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jun;11(6):449.,"The application of neuroimaging methods to product marketing - neuromarketing - has recently gained considerable popularity. We propose that there are two main reasons for this trend. First, the possibility that neuroimaging will become cheaper and faster than other marketing methods; and second, the hope that neuroimaging will provide marketers with information that is not obtainable through conventional marketing methods. Although neuroimaging is unlikely to be cheaper than other tools in the near future, there is growing evidence that it may provide hidden information about the consumer experience. The most promising application of neuroimaging methods to marketing may come before a product is even released - when it is just an idea being developed.","The facial somatosensory map in the cortex is derived from facial representations that are first established at the brainstem level and then serially 'copied' at each stage of the somatosensory pathway. Recent studies have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of somatotopic maps of the face and whiskers in the trigeminal nuclei of the mouse brainstem. This work has revealed that early molecular regionalization and positional patterning of trigeminal ganglion and brainstem target neurons are established by homeodomain transcription factors, the expression of which is induced and maintained by signals from the brain and face. Such position-dependent information is fundamental in transforming the early spatial layout of sensory receptors into a topographic connectivity map that is conferred to higher brain levels.", ,"Protein palmitoylation, a classical and common lipid modification, regulates diverse aspects of neuronal protein trafficking and function. The reversible nature of palmitoylation provides a potential general mechanism for protein shuttling between intracellular compartments. The recent discovery of palmitoylating enzymes--a large DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) protein family--and the development of new proteomic and imaging methods have accelerated palmitoylation analysis. It is becoming clear that individual DHHC enzymes generate and maintain the specialized compartmentalization of substrates in polarized neurons. Here, we discuss the regulatory mechanisms for dynamic protein palmitoylation and the emerging roles of protein palmitoylation in various aspects of pathophysiology, including neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.","Vertebrates and insects have evolved complex repertoires of chemosensory receptors to detect and distinguish odours. With a few exceptions, vertebrate chemosensory receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors that initiate a cascade of cellular signalling events and thereby electrically excite the neuron. Insect receptors, which are structurally and genetically unrelated to vertebrate receptors, are a complex of two distinct molecules that serves both as a receptor for the odorant and as an ion channel that is gated by binding of the odorant. Metabotropic signalling in vertebrates provides a rich panoply of positive and negative regulation, whereas ionotropic signalling in insects enhances processing speed.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 May;11(5):370.,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Nov;11(11):782.,"Neuronal synapses are important microstructures that underlie complex cognitive capacities. Recent studies, primarily in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have revealed surprising parallels between these synapses and the 'chemosensory synapses' that reside at the tips of chemosensory cells that respond to environmental stimuli. Similarities in the structures, mechanisms of action and specific molecules found at these sites extend to the presynaptic, postsynaptic and glial entities composing both synapse types. In this article I propose that chemosensory synapses may serve as useful models of neuronal synapses, and consider the possibility that the two synapse types derive from a common ancestral structure.","Many non-infectious neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the accumulation of fibrillar proteins. These diseases all exhibit features that are reminiscent of those of prionopathies, including phenotypic diversity and the propagation of pathology. Furthermore, emerging studies of amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and tau--proteins implicated in common neurodegenerative diseases--suggest that they share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics with prions. Propagation of protein misfolding in these diseases may therefore occur through mechanisms similar to those that underlie prion pathogenesis. If this hypothesis is verified in vivo, it will suggest new therapeutic strategies to block propagation of protein misfolding throughout the brain.", , , , , , , ,"Converging evidence from electrophysiological, physiological and anatomical studies suggests that abnormalities in the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons may have a central role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Neural oscillations are a fundamental mechanism for the establishment of precise temporal relationships between neuronal responses that are in turn relevant for memory, perception and consciousness. In patients with schizophrenia, the synchronization of beta- and gamma-band activity is abnormal, suggesting a crucial role for dysfunctional oscillations in the generation of the cognitive deficits and other symptoms of the disorder. Dysfunctional oscillations may arise owing to anomalies in the brain's rhythm-generating networks of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons and in cortico-cortical connections.","Dynamic aspects of interactions between astrocytes, neurons and the vasculature have recently been in the neuroscience spotlight. It has emerged that not only neurons but also astrocytes are organized into networks. Whereas neuronal networks exchange information through electrical and chemical synapses, astrocytes are interconnected through gap junction channels that are regulated by extra- and intracellular signals and allow exchange of information. This intercellular communication between glia has implications for neuroglial and gliovascular interactions and hence has added another level of complexity to our understanding of brain function.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Aug;11(8):605; author reply 605. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Aug;11(8):605.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Mar;11(3):218; author reply 218.,"Rarely in the history of neuroscience has a single illustration been as influential as the cytoarchitectonic map of the human brain published by Korbinian Brodmann in his monograph from 1909. The map presents the segregation of the cerebral cortex into 43 areas, as visible in cell body-stained histological sections. More importantly, Brodmann provided a comparative neuroanatomical approach and discussed ontogenetic and pathological aspects as well as structural-functional correlations. One hundred years later, a large number of neuroscientists still use Brodmann's map for localizing neuroimaging data obtained in the living human brain.","The roles of the Wnt signalling pathway in several developmental processes, including synaptic differentiation, are well characterized. The expression of Wnt ligands and Wnt signalling components in the mature mammalian CNS suggests that this pathway might also play a part in synaptic maintenance and function. In fact, Wnts have a crucial role in synaptic physiology, as they modulate the synaptic vesicle cycle, the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors and the interaction of these receptors with scaffold proteins in postsynaptic regions. In addition, Wnts participate in adult neurogenesis and protect excitatory synaptic terminals from amyloid-beta oligomer toxicity. Here, the latest insights into the function of Wnt signalling in the adult nervous system and therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are discussed.","A plethora of discoveries relating to sex influences on brain function is rapidly moving this field into the spotlight for most areas of neuroscience. The domain of molecular or genetic neuroscience is no exception. The goal of this article is to highlight key developments concerning sex-based dimorphisms in molecular neuroscience, describe control mechanisms regulating these differences, address the implications of these dimorphisms for normal and abnormal brain function and discuss what these advances mean for future work in the field. The overriding conclusion is that, as for neuroscience in general, molecular neuroscience has to take into account potential sex influences that might modify signalling pathways.","Initial investigations of the cerebellar microcircuit inspired the Marr-Albus theoretical framework of cerebellar function. We review recent developments in the experimental understanding of cerebellar microcircuit characteristics and in the computational analysis of Marr-Albus models. We conclude that many Marr-Albus models are in effect adaptive filters, and that evidence for symmetrical long-term potentiation and long-term depression, interneuron plasticity, silent parallel fibre synapses and recurrent mossy fibre connectivity is strikingly congruent with predictions from adaptive-filter models of cerebellar function. This congruence suggests that insights from adaptive-filter theory might help to address outstanding issues of cerebellar function, including both microcircuit processing and extra-cerebellar connectivity.","Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is defined as a long-term improvement in performance on a visual task. In recent years, the idea that conscious effort is necessary for VPL to occur has been challenged by research suggesting the involvement of more implicit processing mechanisms, such as reinforcement-driven processing and consolidation. In addition, we have learnt much about the neural substrates of VPL and it has become evident that changes in visual areas and regions beyond the visual cortex can take place during VPL.","Patterned, spontaneous activity occurs in many developing neural circuits, including the retina, the cochlea, the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, where it provides signals that are important for the development of neurons and their connections. Despite there being differences in adult architecture and output across these various circuits, the patterns of spontaneous network activity and the mechanisms that generate it are remarkably similar. The mechanisms can include a depolarizing action of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), transient synaptic connections, extrasynaptic transmission, gap junction coupling and the presence of pacemaker-like neurons. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is robust; if one element of a circuit is disrupted another will generate similar activity. This research suggests that developing neural circuits exhibit transient and tunable features that maintain a source of correlated activity during crucial stages of development.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2011 Feb;12(2):118; author reply 118.,"There is growing evidence that sensory deprivation is associated with crossmodal neuroplastic changes in the brain. After visual or auditory deprivation, brain areas that are normally associated with the lost sense are recruited by spared sensory modalities. These changes underlie adaptive and compensatory behaviours in blind and deaf individuals. Although there are differences between these populations owing to the nature of the deprived sensory modality, there seem to be common principles regarding how the brain copes with sensory loss and the factors that influence neuroplastic changes. Here, we discuss crossmodal neuroplasticity with regards to behavioural adaptation after sensory deprivation and highlight the possibility of maladaptive consequences within the context of rehabilitation.","Understanding the mechanisms that underlie learning is one of the most fascinating and central aims of neurobiological research. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely regarded as a prime candidate for the cellular mechanism of learning. The receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB (also known as NTRK2), known primarily for its function during PNS and CNS development, has emerged in recent years as a potent regulator of hippocampal LTP. Here I describe efforts to understand the signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms that underlie the involvement of TrkB in LTP and learning.","Interest in the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the nervous system has recently expanded to include their roles in neurodegeneration. Investigations have begun to reveal the influence of miRNAs on both neuronal survival and the accumulation of toxic proteins that are associated with neurodegeneration, and are providing clues as to how these toxic proteins can influence miRNA expression.","It is important to understand the balance between cortical plasticity and stability in various systems and across spatial scales in the adult brain. Here we review studies of adult plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1), which has a key role in distributing visual information. There are claims of plasticity at multiple spatial scales in adult V1, but a number of inconsistencies in the supporting data raise questions about the extent and nature of such plasticity. Our understanding of the extent of plasticity in V1 is further limited by a lack of quantitative models to guide the interpretation of the data. These problems limit efforts to translate research findings about adult cortical plasticity into significant clinical, educational and policy applications.","The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for changing established behaviour in the face of unexpected outcomes. This function has been attributed to the role of the OFC in response inhibition or to the idea that the OFC is a rapidly flexible associative-learning area. However, recent data contradict these accounts, and instead suggest that the OFC is crucial for signalling outcome expectancies. We suggest that this function--signalling of expected outcomes--can also explain the crucial role of the OFC in changing behaviour in the face of unexpected outcomes.","Reductions in blood flow to the brain of sufficient duration and extent lead to stroke, which results in damage to neuronal networks and the impairment of sensation, movement or cognition. Evidence from animal models suggests that a time-limited window of neuroplasticity opens following a stroke, during which the greatest gains in recovery occur. Plasticity mechanisms include activity-dependent rewiring and synapse strengthening. The challenge for improving stroke recovery is to understand how to optimally engage and modify surviving neuronal networks, to provide new response strategies that compensate for tissue lost to injury.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of post-transcriptional gene regulation in a plethora of tissues, including the nervous system. Recent evidence points to a widespread role for neural miRNAs at various stages of synaptic development, including dendritogenesis, synapse formation and synapse maturation. Furthermore, studies from invertebrates indicate that miRNAs might contribute to the control of synapse function and plasticity in the adult. Key features of synapse-relevant miRNAs include their ability to regulate mRNA translation locally in the synaptodendritic compartment and the modulation of their expression and function by neuronal activity. The potentially huge impact of miRNA-based mechanisms on higher-order processing, memory and neuropsychiatric disorders in vertebrates is just starting to be recognized.","Neuroscience addresses questions that, if resolved, will reveal aspects of our individuality. Therefore neuroscientific knowledge is not solely constrained within laboratories, but readily captures the attention of the public at large. Ideas, concepts and images in neuroscience widely circulate in culture and are portrayed in literature, film, works of art, the mass media and commercial products, therefore shaping social values and consumer practices. The interaction between art and science offers an opportunity to make the scientific community and the public aware of the social and ethical implications of the scientific advances in neuroscience.", ,"The Allen Brain Atlas, a Web-based, genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain, was an experiment on a massive scale. The development of the atlas faced a combination of great technical challenges and a non-traditional open research model, and it encountered many hurdles on the path to completion and community adoption. Having overcome these challenges, it is now a fundamental tool for neuroscientists worldwide and has set the stage for the creation of other similar open resources. Nevertheless, there are many untapped opportunities for exploration.","The past few years have witnessed dramatic progress on all frontiers of zinc neurobiology. The recent development of powerful tools, including zinc-sensitive fluorescent probes, selective chelators and genetically modified animal models, has brought a deeper understanding of the roles of this cation as a crucial intra- and intercellular signalling ion of the CNS, and hence of the neurophysiological importance of zinc-dependent pathways and the injurious effects of zinc dyshomeostasis. The development of some innovative therapeutic strategies is aimed at controlling and preventing the damaging effects of this cation in neurological conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.","The past decade has seen a transformation in research on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). This cortical area has emerged as a key member of a core network of brain regions that underpins a range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory, navigation, imagination and planning for the future. It is now also evident that the RSC is consistently compromised in the most common neurological disorders that impair memory. Here we review advances on multiple fronts, most notably in neuroanatomy, animal studies and neuroimaging, that have highlighted the importance of the RSC for cognition, and consider why specifying its precise functions remains problematic.","Dreaming has fascinated and mystified humankind for ages: the bizarre and evanescent qualities of dreams have invited boundless speculation about their origin, meaning and purpose. For most of the twentieth century, scientific dream theories were mainly psychological. Since the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the neural underpinnings of dreaming have become increasingly well understood, and it is now possible to complement the details of these brain mechanisms with a theory of consciousness that is derived from the study of dreaming. The theory advanced here emphasizes data that suggest that REM sleep may constitute a protoconscious state, providing a virtual reality model of the world that is of functional use to the development and maintenance of waking consciousness.","Neurons and glial cells show mutual interdependence in many developmental and functional aspects of their biology. To establish their intricate relationships with neurons, glial cells must migrate over what are often long distances. In the CNS glial cells generally migrate as single cells, whereas PNS glial cells tend to migrate as cohorts of cells. How are their journeys initiated and directed, and what stops the migratory phase once glial cells are aligned with their neuronal counterparts? A deeper understanding of glial migration and the underlying neuron-glia interactions may contribute to the development of therapeutics for demyelinating diseases or glial tumours.","The enlargement and species-specific elaboration of the cerebral neocortex during evolution holds the secret to the mental abilities of humans; however, the genetic origin and cellular mechanisms that generated the distinct evolutionary advancements are not well understood. This article describes how novelties that make us human may have been introduced during evolution, based on findings in the embryonic cerebral cortex in different mammalian species. The data on the differences in gene expression, new molecular pathways and novel cellular interactions that have led to these evolutionary advances may also provide insight into the pathogenesis and therapies for human-specific neuropsychiatric disorders.","For many years the mammalian CNS has been seen as an organ that is unable to regenerate. However, it was also long known that lower vertebrate species are capable of impressive regeneration of CNS structures. How did this situation arise through evolution? Increasing cellular and molecular understanding of regeneration in different animal species coupled with studies of adult neurogenesis in mammals is providing a basis for addressing this question. Here we compare CNS regeneration among vertebrates and speculate on how this ability may have emerged or been restricted.","The vertebrate brain is highly complex with millions to billions of neurons. During development, the neural plate border region gives rise to the neural crest, cranial placodes and, in anamniotes, to Rohon-Beard sensory neurons, whereas the boundary region of the midbrain and hindbrain develops organizer properties. Comparisons of developmental gene expression and neuroanatomy between vertebrates and the basal chordate amphioxus, which has only thousands of neurons and lacks a neural crest, most placodes and a midbrain-hindbrain organizer, indicate that these vertebrate features were built on a foundation already present in the ancestral chordate. Recent advances in genomics have provided insights into the elaboration of the molecular toolkit at the invertebrate-vertebrate transition that may have facilitated the evolution of these vertebrate characteristics.","Evolutionary developmental biology, often called evo-devo, seeks to understand the ancestral relationship among organisms by comparing their developmental strategies and ultimately reconstructing the pathways that led to the extraordinary variety of biological forms. The insights from this synthesis of developmental biology and evolutionary principles are useful for understanding the development of the nervous system. The pervasive and crucial roles of microRNAs in nervous system development suggest that these short non-coding transcripts deserve a chapter in the unfolding evo-devo story. The structure of microRNAs, their physical proximity to other genes and their network effects on targets make this class of transcripts tractable genetic material for evolutionary change.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Nov;10(11):829.,"Sleep is often viewed as a vulnerable state that is incompatible with behaviours that nourish and propagate species. This has led to the hypothesis that sleep has survived because it fulfills some universal, but as yet unknown, vital function. I propose that sleep is best understood as a variant of dormant states seen throughout the plant and animal kingdoms and that it is itself highly adaptive because it optimizes the timing and duration of behaviour. Current evidence indicates that ecological variables are the main determinants of sleep duration and intensity across species.","The fundamental architecture of the cerebellum is concealed within a terminological forest - transverse zones and stripes, longitudinal zones and microzones, patches, etc. To make things worse, the same term is used in different contexts to describe quite different patterns of spatial localization. Here we consider the possibility that this complexity hides the fact that the cerebellar cortex contains only one map, which has been charted in various ways.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Oct;10(10):759.,"Advances in technology have equipped the field of neuroproteomics with refined tools for the study of the expression, interaction and function of proteins in the nervous system. In combination with bioinformatics, neuroproteomics can address the organization of dynamic, functional protein networks and macromolecular structures that underlie physiological, anatomical and behavioural processes. Furthermore, neuroproteomics is contributing to the elucidation of disease mechanisms and is a powerful tool for the identification of biomarkers.","Although WNTs have been long thought of as regulators of cell fate, recent studies highlight their involvement in crucial aspects of synaptic development in the nervous system. Particularly compelling are recent studies of the neuromuscular junction in nematodes, insects, fish and mammals. These studies place WNTs as major determinants of synapse differentiation and neurotransmitter receptor clustering.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Nov;10(11):829.,"Biomaterials are likely to have an increasingly important role in the treatment of nervous system disorders. Recently developed biomaterials can enable and augment the targeted delivery of drugs or therapeutic proteins to the brain, allow cell or tissue transplants to be effectively delivered to the brain and help to rebuild damaged circuits. Similarly, biomaterials are being used to promote regeneration and to repair damaged neuronal pathways in combination with stem cell therapies. Many of these approaches are gaining momentum because nanotechnology allows greater control over material-cell interactions that induce specific developmental processes and cellular responses including differentiation, migration and outgrowth.","It has been known for a long time that genetic factors affect sleep quantity and quality. Genetic screens have identified several mutations that affect sleep across species, pointing to an evolutionary conserved regulation of sleep. Moreover, it has also been recognized that sleep affects gene expression. These findings have given valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of sleep regulation and function that might lead the way to more efficient treatments for sleep disorders.","Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a relentless preoccupation with dieting and weight loss that results in severe emaciation and sometimes death. It is controversial whether such symptoms are secondary to psychosocial influences, are a consequence of obsessions and anxiety or reflect a primary disturbance of brain appetitive circuits. New brain imaging technology provides insights into ventral and dorsal neural circuit dysfunction - perhaps related to altered serotonin and dopamine metabolism - that contributes to the puzzling symptoms found in people with eating disorders. For example, altered insula activity could explain interoceptive dysfunction, and altered striatal activity might shed light on altered reward modulation in people with anorexia nervosa.","The nearly 2,000 glomeruli that cover the surface of the olfactory bulb are so distinctive that they were noted specifically in the earliest of Cajal's catalogues. They have variously been considered a functional unit, an organizational unit and a crucial component of the olfactory coding circuit. Despite their central position in olfactory processing, the development of the glomeruli has only recently begun to be investigated with new and powerful genetic tools. Some unexpected findings have been made that may lead to a new understanding of the processes involved in wiring sensory regions of the brain. It may no longer be sufficient to simply invoke genes, spikes and their interplay in the construction of brain circuits. The story of 'how the olfactory bulb got its glomeruli' may be more complex, and more revealing, than has been supposed.","Many neurogenetic disorders are caused by the mutation of ubiquitously expressed genes. One such disorder, spinal muscular atrophy, is caused by loss or mutation of the survival motor neuron1 gene (SMN1), leading to reduced SMN protein levels and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons. SMN, together with partner proteins, functions in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are important for pre-mRNA splicing. It has also been suggested that SMN might function in the assembly of other ribonucleoprotein complexes. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the molecular dysfunction that gives rise to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and its specificity to a particular group of neurons. The first hypothesis states that the loss of SMN's well-known function in snRNP assembly causes an alteration in the splicing of a specific gene (or genes). The second hypothesis proposes that SMN is crucial for the transport of mRNA in neurons and that disruption of this function results in SMA.","Addiction is associated with neuroplasticity in the corticostriatal brain circuitry that is important for guiding adaptive behaviour. The hierarchy of corticostriatal information processing that normally permits the prefrontal cortex to regulate reinforcement-seeking behaviours is impaired by chronic drug use. A failure of the prefrontal cortex to control drug-seeking behaviours can be linked to an enduring imbalance between synaptic and non-synaptic glutamate, termed glutamate homeostasis. The imbalance in glutamate homeostasis engenders changes in neuroplasticity that impair communication between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Some of these pathological changes are amenable to new glutamate- and neuroplasticity-based pharmacotherapies for treating addiction.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Aug;10(8):following 596.,"Research on brain-machine interfaces has been ongoing for at least a decade. During this period, simultaneous recordings of the extracellular electrical activity of hundreds of individual neurons have been used for direct, real-time control of various artificial devices. Brain-machine interfaces have also added greatly to our knowledge of the fundamental physiological principles governing the operation of large neural ensembles. Further understanding of these principles is likely to have a key role in the future development of neuroprosthetics for restoring mobility in severely paralysed patients.","Neurobiologists have long sought to understand how circuits in the nervous system are organized to generate the precise neural outputs that underlie particular behaviours. The motor circuits in the spinal cord that control locomotion, commonly referred to as central pattern generator networks, provide an experimentally tractable model system for investigating how moderately complex ensembles of neurons generate select motor behaviours. The advent of novel molecular and genetic techniques coupled with recent advances in our knowledge of spinal cord development means that a comprehensive understanding of how the motor circuitry is organized and operates may be within our grasp.","Acute neurological conditions such as cerebrovascular diseases and trauma are associated with irreversible loss of neurons and glial cells. Severe or prolonged injury results in uncontrollable cell death within the core of lesions. Conversely, cells that are less severely damaged succumb in a relatively slow fashion, frequently via the intrinsic pathway of cell death, through the deterioration of mitochondrial functions. The permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes determines whether cells will succumb to or survive the injury, and represents a 'point of no return' in mitochondrial cell death. It is therefore an attractive target for the development of new neuroprotective interventions.","It was recently discovered that two different types of voltage-insensitive K+ channels, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) and small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, are located on dendritic branches, spines and shafts in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses in many central neurons. Together with increases in our knowledge of how these channels are regulated through stable protein-protein interactions in multi-protein complexes, this has added another layer of complexity to our understanding of synaptic transmission and plasticity.","The characterization of mouse models of human disease is essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiology and developing new therapeutics. Many diseases are often associated with more than one model, and so there is a need to determine which model most closely represents the disease state or is most suited to the therapeutic approach under investigation. In the case of neurological disease, motor tests provide a good read-out of neurological function. This overview of available motor tasks aims to aid researchers in making the correct choice of test when attempting to tease out a transgenic phenotype or when assessing the recovery of motor function following therapeutic intervention.","Electrical synaptic transmission through gap junctions underlies direct and rapid neuronal communication in the CNS. The diversity of functional roles that electrical synapses have is perhaps best exemplified in the vertebrate retina, in which gap junctions are formed by each of the five major neuron types. These junctions are dynamically regulated by ambient illumination and by circadian rhythms acting through light-activated neuromodulators such as dopamine and nitric oxide, which in turn activate intracellular signalling pathways in the retina.The networks formed by electrically coupled neurons are plastic and reconfigurable, and those in the retina are positioned to play key and diverse parts in the transmission and processing of visual information at every retinal level.","Emotionally significant experiences tend to be well remembered, and the amygdala has a pivotal role in this process. But the efficient encoding of emotional memories can become maladaptive - severe stress often turns them into a source of chronic anxiety. Here, we review studies that have identified neural correlates of stress-induced modulation of amygdala structure and function - from cellular mechanisms to their behavioural consequences. The unique features of stress-induced plasticity in the amygdala, in association with changes in other brain regions, could have long-term consequences for cognitive performance and pathological anxiety exhibited in people with affective disorders.","The survival and well-being of all species requires appropriate physiological responses to environmental and homeostatic challenges. The re- establishment and maintenance of homeostasis entails the coordinated activation and control of neuroendocrine and autonomic stress systems. These collective stress responses are mediated by largely overlapping circuits in the limbic forebrain, the hypothalamus and the brainstem, so that the respective contributions of the neuroendocrine and autonomic systems are tuned in accordance with stressor modality and intensity. Limbic regions that are responsible for regulating stress responses intersect with circuits that are responsible for memory and reward, providing a means to tailor the stress response with respect to prior experience and anticipated outcomes.", ,"Every individual experiences stressful life events. In some cases acute or chronic stress leads to depression and other psychiatric disorders, but most people are resilient to such effects. Recent research has begun to identify the environmental, genetic, epigenetic and neural mechanisms that underlie resilience, and has shown that resilience is mediated by adaptive changes in several neural circuits involving numerous neurotransmitter and molecular pathways. These changes shape the functioning of the neural circuits that regulate reward, fear, emotion reactivity and social behaviour, which together are thought to mediate successful coping with stress.","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) - the most evolved brain region - subserves our highest-order cognitive abilities. However, it is also the brain region that is most sensitive to the detrimental effects of stress exposure. Even quite mild acute uncontrollable stress can cause a rapid and dramatic loss of prefrontal cognitive abilities, and more prolonged stress exposure causes architectural changes in prefrontal dendrites. Recent research has begun to reveal the intracellular signalling pathways that mediate the effects of stress on the PFC. This research has provided clues as to why genetic or environmental insults that disinhibit stress signalling pathways can lead to symptoms of profound prefrontal cortical dysfunction in mental illness.","Chronic exposure to stress hormones, whether it occurs during the prenatal period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood or aging, has an impact on brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. However, the specific effects on the brain, behaviour and cognition emerge as a function of the timing and the duration of the exposure, and some also depend on the interaction between gene effects and previous exposure to environmental adversity. Advances in animal and human studies have made it possible to synthesize these findings, and in this Review a model is developed to explain why different disorders emerge in individuals exposed to stress at different times in their lives.","The impact of stress on brain function is increasingly recognized. Various substances are released in response to stress and can influence distinct neuronal circuits, but the functional advantages of having such a diversity of stress mediators remain unclear. Individual neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and steroid stress mediators have specific spatial and temporal niches, but these niches also overlap. In addition, the effects of individual mediators on neuronal function and plasticity are integrated, and emerging evidence suggests that there is crosstalk between them. Together, this results in the stress instruments producing an orchestrated 'symphony' that enables fine-tuned responses to diverse challenges.", , , , , , , , , ,"Traditional descriptions of the cortical cholinergic input system focused on the diffuse organization of cholinergic projections and the hypothesis that slowly changing levels of extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) mediate different arousal states. The ability of ACh to reach the extrasynaptic space (volume neurotransmission), as opposed to remaining confined to the synaptic cleft (wired neurotransmission), has been considered an integral component of this conceptualization. Recent studies demonstrated that phasic release of ACh, at the scale of seconds, mediates precisely defined cognitive operations. This characteristic of cholinergic neurotransmission is proposed to be of primary importance for understanding cholinergic function and developing treatments for cognitive disorders that result from abnormal cholinergic neurotransmission.","Information transfer at chemical synapses occurs when vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release neurotransmitter. This process is stochastic and its likelihood of occurrence is a crucial factor in the regulation of signal propagation in neuronal networks. The reliability of neurotransmitter release can be highly variable: experimental data from electrophysiological, molecular and imaging studies have demonstrated that synaptic terminals can individually set their neurotransmitter release probability dynamically through local feedback regulation. This local tuning of transmission has important implications for current models of single-neuron computation.","During the past decade enormous advances have been made in our understanding of the basic molecular machinery that is involved in the development of neuronal polarity. Far from being mere structural elements, microtubules are emerging as key determinants of neuronal polarity. Here we review the current understanding of the regulation of microtubule assembly, organization and dynamics in axons and dendrites. These studies provide new insight into microtubules' function in neuronal development and their potential contribution to plasticity.","Incoming sensory information is sent to the brain along modality-specific channels corresponding to the five senses. Each of these channels further parses the incoming signals into parallel streams to provide a compact, efficient input to the brain. Ultimately, these parallel input signals must be elaborated on and integrated in the cortex to provide a unified and coherent percept. Recent studies in the primate visual cortex have greatly contributed to our understanding of how this goal is accomplished. Multiple strategies including retinal tiling, hierarchical and parallel processing and modularity, defined spatially and by cell type-specific connectivity, are used by the visual system to recover the intricate detail of our visual surroundings.","During object manipulation tasks, the brain selects and implements action-phase controllers that use sensory predictions and afferent signals to tailor motor output to the physical properties of the objects involved. Analysis of signals in tactile afferent neurons and central processes in humans reveals how contact events are encoded and used to monitor and update task performance.","The vast majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are late-onset and their development is probably influenced by both genetic and environmental risk factors. A strong genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the presence of the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which encodes a protein with crucial roles in cholesterol metabolism. There is mounting evidence that APOE4 contributes to AD pathogenesis by modulating the metabolism and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide and by directly regulating brain lipid metabolism and synaptic functions through APOE receptors. Emerging knowledge of the contribution of APOE to the pathophysiology of AD presents new opportunities for AD therapy.","Converging evidence suggests that each parahippocampal and hippocampal subregion contributes uniquely to the encoding, consolidation and retrieval of declarative memories, but their precise roles remain elusive. Current functional thinking does not fully incorporate the intricately connected networks that link these subregions, owing to their organizational complexity; however, such detailed anatomical knowledge is of pivotal importance for comprehending the unique functional contribution of each subregion. We have therefore developed an interactive diagram with the aim to display all of the currently known anatomical connections of the rat parahippocampal-hippocampal network. In this Review, we integrate the existing anatomical knowledge into a concise description of this network and discuss the functional implications of some relatively underexposed connections.","The wiring of the nervous system requires a complex orchestration of developmental events. Emerging evidence suggests that transient cell-cell interactions often serve as positional cues for axon guidance and synaptogenesis during the assembly of neural circuits. In contrast to the relatively stable cellular interactions between synaptic partners in mature circuits, these transient interactions involve cells that are not destined to be pre- or postsynaptic cells. Here we review the roles of these transient cell-cell interactions in a variety of developmental contexts and describe the mechanisms through which they organize neural connections.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 May;10(5):390.,"The motor theory of speech perception assumes that activation of the motor system is essential in the perception of speech. However, deficits in speech perception and comprehension do not arise from damage that is restricted to the motor cortex, few functional imaging studies reveal activity in the motor cortex during speech perception, and the motor cortex is strongly activated by many different sound categories. Here, we evaluate alternative roles for the motor cortex in spoken communication and suggest a specific role in sensorimotor processing in conversation. We argue that motor cortex activation is essential in joint speech, particularly for the timing of turn taking.","The formation of axons and dendrites and maintenance of the neuron's vastly expanded surface require the continuous addition of new membrane. This is achieved by membrane synthesis through the secretory pathway followed by regulated vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, typically in the distal neurite. However, it is far from simple: multiple distinct membrane carriers are used to target specific membrane domains, dendrites seem to operate semi-autonomously from the rest of the neuron, and exocytosis for membrane expansion is different from that for release of synaptic vesicles. Current knowledge of this process and its implications for neuronal development, function and repair are reviewed.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Jun;10(6):466.,"Following CNS injury, in an apparently counterintuitive response, scar tissue formation inhibits axonal growth, imposing a major barrier to regeneration. Accordingly, scar-modulating treatments have become a leading therapeutic goal in the field of spinal cord injury. However, increasing evidence suggests a beneficial role for this scar tissue as part of the endogenous local immune regulation and repair process. How can these opposing effects be reconciled? Perhaps it is all a matter of timing.","Consolidated memories can re-enter states of transient instability following reactivation, from which they must again stabilize in order to persist, contradicting the previously dominant view that memory and its associated plasticity mechanisms progressively and irreversibly decline with time. We witness exciting times, as neuroscience begins embracing a position, long-held in cognitive psychology, that recognizes memory as a principally dynamic process. In light of remaining controversy, we here establish that the same operational definitions and types of evidence underpin the deduction of both reconsolidation and consolidation, thus validating the extrapolation that post-retrieval memory plasticity reflects processes akin to those that stabilized the memory following acquisition.","To a large extent, progress in neuroscience has been driven by the study of single-cell responses averaged over several repetitions of stimuli or behaviours. However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.","Good sleep is necessary for physical and mental health. For example, sleep loss impairs immune function, and sleep is altered during infection. Immune signalling molecules are present in the healthy brain, where they interact with neurochemical systems to contribute to the regulation of normal sleep. Animal studies have shown that interactions between immune signalling molecules (such as the cytokine interleukin 1) and brain neurochemical systems (such as the serotonin system) are amplified during infection, indicating that these interactions might underlie the changes in sleep that occur during infection. Why should the immune system cause us to sleep differently when we are sick? We propose that the alterations in sleep architecture during infection are exquisitely tailored to support the generation of fever, which in turn imparts survival value.","Mood, attention and motivation co-vary with activity in the neuromodulatory systems of the brain to influence behaviour. These psychological states, mediated by neuromodulators, have a profound influence on the cognitive processes of attention, perception and, particularly, our ability to retrieve memories from the past and make new ones. Moreover, many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are related to dysfunction of these neuromodulatory systems. Neurons of the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus are the sole source of noradrenaline, a neuromodulator that has a key role in all of these forebrain activities. Elucidating the factors that control the activity of these neurons and the effect of noradrenaline in target regions is key to understanding how the brain allocates attention and apprehends the environment to select, store and retrieve information for generating adaptive behaviour.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Apr;10(4):312., ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Apr;10(4):312.,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Mar;10(3):242.,"Most molecular and cellular studies of cognitive function have focused on either normal or pathological states, but recent research with transgenic mice has started to address the mechanisms of enhanced cognition. These results point to key synaptic and nuclear signalling events that can be manipulated to facilitate the induction or increase the stability of synaptic plasticity, and therefore enhance the acquisition or retention of information. Here, we review these surprising findings and explore their implications to both mechanisms of learning and memory and to ongoing efforts to develop treatments for cognitive disorders. These findings represent the beginning of a fundamental new approach in the study of enhanced cognition.","As the major components of the postsynaptic density of excitatory neuronal synapses, PDZ-domain-containing scaffold proteins regulate the clustering of surface glutamate receptors, organize synaptic signalling complexes, participate in the dynamic trafficking of receptors and ion channels, and coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics. These scaffold proteins often contain multiple PDZ domains, with or without other protein-binding modules, and they usually lack intrinsic enzymatic activities. Recent biochemical and structural studies have shown that tandemly arranged PDZ domains often serve as structural and functional supramodules that could regulate the organization and dynamics of synaptic protein complexes, thus contributing to the broad range of neuronal activity.","A conspicuous ability of the brain is to seamlessly assimilate and process spatial and temporal features of sensory stimuli. This ability is indispensable for the recognition of natural stimuli. Yet, a general computational framework for processing spatiotemporal stimuli remains elusive. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that spatiotemporal processing emerges from the interaction between incoming stimuli and the internal dynamic state of neural networks, including not only their ongoing spiking activity but also their 'hidden' neuronal states, such as short-term synaptic plasticity.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Mar;10(3):242., ,"The anterior insular cortex (AIC) is implicated in a wide range of conditions and behaviours, from bowel distension and orgasm, to cigarette craving and maternal love, to decision making and sudden insight. Its function in the re-representation of interoception offers one possible basis for its involvement in all subjective feelings. New findings suggest a fundamental role for the AIC (and the von Economo neurons it contains) in awareness, and thus it needs to be considered as a potential neural correlate of consciousness.","Glia have emerged as key contributors to pathological and chronic pain mechanisms. On activation, both astrocytes and microglia respond to and release a number of signalling molecules, which have protective and/or pathological functions. Here we review the current understanding of the contribution of glia to pathological pain and neuroprotection, and how the protective, anti-inflammatory actions of glia are being harnessed to develop new drug targets for neuropathic pain control. Given the prevalence of chronic pain and the partial efficacy of current drugs, which exclusively target neuronal mechanisms, new strategies to manipulate neuron-glia interactions in pain processing hold considerable promise.","NG2 cells (also known as polydendrocytes) are a population of CNS cells that are distinct from neurons, mature oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. They can be identified by the expression of the proteoglycan NG2, have a highly branched morphology and are distributed throughout the grey and white matter. They differentiate into oligodendrocytes in vitro and have often been equated with oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, whether polydendrocytes are multipotential cells that can give rise to neurons and astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes is now highly debated. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies indicate that polydendrocytes receive synaptic input from neurons, suggesting that they are integrated in the neural network. This Review highlights recent findings and unresolved questions related to the lineage and function of polydendrocytes in the CNS.","Brain banks collect post-mortem human brains to foster research into human CNS function and disease. They have been indispensable for uncovering the secrets of many diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. At a time when there are so many open questions in neuroscience and the incidence of brain diseases continues to increase in parallel with the aging of the population, brain banking remains at the heart of brain research. However, the major source of brain banks, the clinical autopsy, is rapidly falling into limbo. New strategies, including donor programmes, medico-legal autopsies and banking in networks, as well as fresh considerations of the ethics and public relations, are required.","Advances in cognitive neuroscience offer us new ways to understand the symptoms of mental illness by uniting basic neurochemical and neurophysiological observations with the conscious experiences that characterize these symptoms. Cognitive theories about the positive symptoms of schizophrenia--hallucinations and delusions--have tended to treat perception and belief formation as distinct processes. However, recent advances in computational neuroscience have led us to consider the unusual perceptual experiences of patients and their sometimes bizarre beliefs as part of the same core abnormality--a disturbance in error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs about the world. We suggest that it is possible to understand these symptoms in terms of a disturbed hierarchical Bayesian framework, without recourse to separate considerations of experience and belief.",Humans in different cultures develop a similar capacity to recognize the emotional signals of diverse facial expressions. This capacity is mediated by a brain network that involves emotion-related brain circuits and higher-level visual-representation areas. Recent studies suggest that the key components of this network begin to emerge early in life. The studies also suggest that initial biases in emotion-related brain circuits and the early coupling of these circuits and cortical perceptual areas provide a foundation for a rapid acquisition of representations of those facial features that denote specific emotions., , ,Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2008 Dec;9(12). doi: 10.1038/nrn2514.,"The capacity for voluntary action is seen as essential to human nature. Yet neuroscience and behaviourist psychology have traditionally dismissed the topic as unscientific, perhaps because the mechanisms that cause actions have long been unclear. However, new research has identified networks of brain areas, including the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex, that underlie voluntary action. These areas generate information for forthcoming actions, and also cause the distinctive conscious experience of intending to act and then controlling one's own actions. Volition consists of a series of decisions regarding whether to act, what action to perform and when to perform it. Neuroscientific accounts of voluntary action may inform debates about the nature of individual responsibility.","Measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) has been fundamental to our understanding of how language is encoded in the brain. One particular ERP response, the N400 response, has been especially influential as an index of lexical and semantic processing. However, there remains a lack of consensus on the interpretation of this component. Resolving this issue has important consequences for neural models of language comprehension. Here we show that evidence bearing on where the N400 response is generated provides key insights into what it reflects. A neuroanatomical model of semantic processing is used as a guide to interpret the pattern of activated regions in functional MRI, magnetoencephalography and intracranial recordings that are associated with contextual semantic manipulations that lead to N400 effects.","The peak age of onset for many psychiatric disorders is adolescence, a time of remarkable physical and behavioural changes. The processes in the brain that underlie these behavioural changes have been the subject of recent investigations. What do we know about the maturation of the human brain during adolescence? Do structural changes in the cerebral cortex reflect synaptic pruning? Are increases in white-matter volume driven by myelination? Is the adolescent brain more or less sensitive to reward? Finding answers to these questions might enable us to further our understanding of mental health during adolescence.","VPS10P-domain receptors, such as SORLA and sortilin, constitute a recently identified class of type-1 receptors that are expressed in neurons. Family members are multifunctional proteins that target a range of ligands, including trophic factors and neuropeptides but also other transmembrane proteins. New findings have revealed unexpected roles for VPS10P-domain receptors as regulators of neuronal viability and function through the regulation of both protein transport and signal transduction. Loss of these activities might contribute to the pathophysiology of devastating disorders of the nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, affective disorders and post-traumatic neuronal cell death.","Sleep is vital to cognitive performance, productivity, health and well-being. Earlier theories of sleep presumed that it occurred at the level of the whole organism and that it was governed by central control mechanisms. However, evidence now indicates that sleep might be regulated at a more local level in the brain: it seems to be a fundamental property of neuronal networks and is dependent on prior activity in each network. Such local-network sleep might be initiated by metabolically driven changes in the production of sleep-regulatory substances. We discuss a mathematical model which illustrates that the sleep-like states of individual cortical columns can be synchronized through humoral and electrical connections, and that whole-organism sleep occurs as an emergent property of local-network interactions.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Mar;10(3):241; author reply 241.,"Remyelination involves reinvesting demyelinated axons with new myelin sheaths. In stark contrast to the situation that follows loss of neurons or axonal damage, remyelination in the CNS can be a highly effective regenerative process. It is mediated by a population of precursor cells called oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are widely distributed throughout the adult CNS. However, despite its efficiency in experimental models and in some clinical diseases, remyelination is often inadequate in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disease and a cause of neurological disability in young adults. The failure of remyelination has profound consequences for the health of axons, the progressive and irreversible loss of which accounts for the progressive nature of these diseases. The mechanisms of remyelination therefore provide critical clues for regeneration biologists that help them to determine why remyelination fails in MS and in other demyelinating diseases and how it might be enhanced therapeutically.","Eukaryotic protein degradation by the proteasome and the lysosome is a dynamic and complex process in which ubiquitin has a key regulatory role. The distinctive morphology of the postmitotic neuron creates unique challenges for protein degradation systems with respect to cell-surface protein turnover and substrate delivery to proteolytic machineries that are required for both synaptic plasticity and self-renewal. Moreover, the discovery of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases underlines the importance and vulnerability of the degradative system in neurons. In this article, we discuss the molecular mechanism of protein degradation in the neuron with respect to both its function and its dysfunction.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Mar;10(3):242.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2009 Jan;10(1):78; author reply 78., ,"The efficient and selective removal of apoptotic cells is an important feature of tissue development, homeostasis and pathology. In the nervous system, synapses and distal axons are selectively eliminated as part of the remodelling that underpins development and pathology, through a process that has some features in common with apoptotic cell removal. Components of the complement cascade are implicated in the efficient removal of apoptotic cells outside the nervous system, and recent evidence suggests that the complement components C1q and C3 have a role in the selective tagging of supernumerary synapses in the developing visual system and in their efficient removal by as yet unidentified cells.","The genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely elusive despite early successes in identifying three genes that cause early-onset familial AD (those that encode amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilins (PSEN1 and PSEN2)), and one genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (APOE)). A large number of studies that aimed to help uncover the remaining disease-related loci have been published in recent decades, collectively proposing or refuting the involvement of over 500 different gene candidates. Systematic meta-analyses of these studies currently highlight more than 20 loci that have modest but significant effects on AD risk. This Review discusses the putative pathogenetic roles and common biochemical pathways of some of the most genetically and biologically compelling of these potential AD risk factors.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Mar;11(3):218. Dosage error in article text.,"Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating of the psychiatric disorders. Studies have shown that cognitive therapy is as efficacious as antidepressant medication at treating depression, and it seems to reduce the risk of relapse even after its discontinuation. Cognitive therapy and antidepressant medication probably engage some similar neural mechanisms, as well as mechanisms that are distinctive to each. A precise specification of these mechanisms might one day be used to guide treatment selection and improve outcomes.","High-content analysis (HCA) combines automated microscopy and automated image analysis to quantify complex cellular anatomy and biochemistry objectively, accurately and quickly. High-content assays that are applicable to neuroscience include those that can quantify various aspects of dendritic trees, protein aggregation, transcription factor translocation, neurotransmitter receptor internalization, neuron and synapse number, cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. The data that are generated by HCA are rich and multiplexed. HCA thus provides a powerful high-throughput tool for neuroscientists.","Distinct human neurodegenerative diseases share remarkably similar temporal emergence patterns, even though different toxic proteins are involved in their onset. Typically, familial neurodegenerative diseases emerge during the fifth decade of life, whereas sporadic cases do not exhibit symptoms earlier than the seventh decade. Recently, mechanistic links between the aging process and toxic protein aggregation, a common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, have been revealed. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signalling pathway - a lifespan, metabolism and stress-resistance regulator - links neurodegeneration to the aging process. Thus, although a reduction of insulin signalling can result in diabetes, its reduction can also increase longevity and delay the onset of protein-aggregation-mediated toxicity. Here we review this apparent paradox and delineate the therapeutic potential of manipulating the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","Neuropathological changes in Parkinson's disease progress slowly and spread according to a characteristic pattern. Recent papers have shed light on this progression of pathology by examining the fate of neurons grafted into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. Two of these studies demonstrate that grafted healthy neurons can gradually develop the same pathology as host neurons in the diseased brains. According to these studies, implanted neurons developed alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy bodies more than a decade after transplantation. We discuss the possible underlying mechanisms and their implications for how pathology spreads in Parkinson's disease.","Research that combines genetic and cognitive neuroscience data aims to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie human behaviour and experience by way of 'intermediate phenotypes': variations in brain function. Using neuroimaging and other methods, this approach is poised to make the transition from health-focused investigations to inquiries into cognitive, affective and social functions, including ones that do not readily lend themselves to animal models. The growing pains of this emerging field are evident, yet there are also reasons for a measured optimism.","Computational neuroscience combines theory and experiment to shed light on the principles and mechanisms of neural computation. This approach has been highly fruitful in the ongoing effort to understand velocity computation by the primate visual system. This Review describes the success of spatiotemporal-energy models in representing local-velocity detection. It shows why local-velocity measurements tend to differ from the velocity of the object as a whole. Certain cells in the middle temporal area are thought to solve this problem by combining local-velocity estimates to compute the overall pattern velocity. The Review discusses different models for how this might occur and experiments that test these models. Although no model is yet firmly established, evidence suggests that computing pattern velocity from local-velocity estimates involves simple operations in the spatiotemporal frequency domain.","The immense range of human behaviours is rooted in the complex neural networks of the cerebrum. The creation of these networks depends on the precise integration of specific neuronal subtypes that are born in different regions of the telencephalon. Here, using the mouse as a model system, we review how these proliferative zones are established. Moreover, we discuss how these regions can be traced back in development to the function of a few key genes, including those that encode fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), paired box 6 (PAX6) and LIM homeobox protein 2 (LHX2), that pattern the early telencephalon.", ,"For centuries people have aspired to understand and control the functions of the mind and brain. It has now become possible to image the functioning of the human brain in real time using functional MRI (fMRI), and thereby to access both sides of the mind-brain interface--subjective experience (that is, one's mind) and objective observations (that is, external, quantitative measurements of one's brain activity)--simultaneously. Developments in neuroimaging are now being translated into many new potential practical applications, including the reading of brain states, brain-computer interfaces, communicating with locked-in patients, lie detection, and learning control over brain activation to modulate cognition or even treat disease.","Computational neuroscience models can be used to understand the diminished stability and noisy neurodynamical behaviour of prefrontal cortex networks in schizophrenia. These neurodynamical properties can be captured by simulated neural networks with randomly spiking neurons that introduce noise into the system and produce trial-by-trial variation of postsynaptic potentials. Theoretical and experimental studies have aimed to understand schizophrenia in relation to noise and signal-to-noise ratio, which are promising concepts for understanding the symptoms that characterize this heterogeneous illness. Simulations of biologically realistic neural networks show how the functioning of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and dopamine receptors is connected to the concepts of noise and variability, and to related neurophysiological findings and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.","L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) remains the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, chronic use causes dyskinesia, a complex motor phenomenon that consists of two components: the execution of involuntary movements in response to drug administration, and the 'priming' phenomenon that underlies these movements' establishment and persistence. A reinterpretation of recent data suggests that priming for dyskinesia results from nigral denervation and the loss of striatal dopamine input, which alters glutamatergic synaptic connectivity in the striatum. The subsequent response of the abnormal basal ganglia to dopaminergic drugs determines the manner and timing of dyskinesia expression. The combination of nigral denervation and drug treatment establishes inappropriate signalling between the motor cortex and the striatum, leading to persistent dyskinesia.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2008 Dec;9(12):965; author reply 965.,"The contribution of the parietal cortex to episodic memory is a fascinating scientific puzzle. On the one hand, parietal lesions do not normally yield severe episodic-memory deficits; on the other hand, parietal activations are seen frequently in functional-neuroimaging studies of episodic memory. A review of these two categories of evidence suggests that the answer to the puzzle requires us to distinguish between the contributions of dorsal and ventral parietal regions and between the influence of top-down and bottom-up attention on memory.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2008 Sep;9(9):709.,"Our movements can hinder our ability to sense the world. Movements can induce sensory input (for example, when you hit something) that is indistinguishable from the input that is caused by external agents (for example, when something hits you). It is critical for nervous systems to be able to differentiate between these two scenarios. A ubiquitous strategy is to route copies of movement commands to sensory structures. These signals, which are referred to as corollary discharge (CD), influence sensory processing in myriad ways. Here we review the CD circuits that have been uncovered by neurophysiological studies and suggest a functional taxonomic classification of CD across the animal kingdom. This broad understanding of CD circuits lays the groundwork for more challenging studies that combine neurophysiology and psychophysics to probe the role of CD in perception.","Personalized medication that is based on pharmacogenetic data has long been expected to improve the efficacy of treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, the complexity of the regulation of gene transcription and its interactions with environmental factors means that straightforward translation of individual genetic information into tailored treatment is unlikely. Nevertheless, when data from genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, neuroimaging and neuroendocrinology are used in combination, they could lead to the development of effective personalized antidepressant treatment that is based on both genotypes and biomarkers. This process will require many further steps and collaboration between basic and clinical neuroscience.","Epilepsy is a complex set of disorders that can involve many areas of the cortex, as well as underlying deep-brain systems. The myriad manifestations of seizures, which can be as varied as déjà vu and olfactory hallucination, can therefore give researchers insights into regional functions and relations. Epilepsy is also complex genetically and pathophysiologically: it involves microscopic (on the scale of ion channels and synaptic proteins), macroscopic (on the scale of brain trauma and rewiring) and intermediate changes in a complex interplay of causality. It has long been recognized that computer modelling will be required to disentangle causality, to better understand seizure spread and to understand and eventually predict treatment efficacy. Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made in modelling epilepsy at levels ranging from the molecular to the socioeconomic. We review these efforts and connect them to the medical goals of understanding and treating the disorder.","It has long been suspected that the relative abundance of specific nutrients can affect cognitive processes and emotions. Newly described influences of dietary factors on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity have revealed some of the vital mechanisms that are responsible for the action of diet on brain health and mental function. Several gut hormones that can enter the brain, or that are produced in the brain itself, influence cognitive ability. In addition, well-established regulators of synaptic plasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, can function as metabolic modulators, responding to peripheral signals such as food intake. Understanding the molecular basis of the effects of food on cognition will help us to determine how best to manipulate diet in order to increase the resistance of neurons to insults and promote mental fitness.","Neuroscience produces a vast amount of data from an enormous diversity of neurons. A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic evolution of this project.","Insoluble protein aggregates have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recent work in transgenic mice has shed light on the role of these aggregates by identifying soluble oligomeric species that may interfere with essential cellular mechanisms at an early disease stage. This review summarizes what we have learned about the roles of these proteins from transgenic mice and invertebrate species such as flies and worms. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of tissue from these animal models have identified new molecules with crucial roles in disease. Moreover, transgenic animals have been instrumental in defining drug targets and designing novel therapeutic strategies. With advanced imaging techniques that can be used in both humans and mice an early, preclinical diagnosis of AD and FTD could be within reach.","Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that migrate, divide and fuse. Cycles of mitochondrial fission and fusion ensure metabolite and mitochondrial DNA mixing and dictate organelle shape, number and bioenergetic functionality. There is mounting evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and causal event in neurodegeneration. Mutations in the mitochondrial fusion GTPases mitofusin 2 and optic atrophy 1, neurotoxins and oxidative stress all disrupt the cable-like morphology of functional mitochondria. This results in impaired bioenergetics and mitochondrial migration, and can trigger neurodegeneration. These findings suggest potential new treatment avenues for neurodegenerative diseases.","Neuroeconomics is the study of the neurobiological and computational basis of value-based decision making. Its goal is to provide a biologically based account of human behaviour that can be applied in both the natural and the social sciences. This Review proposes a framework to investigate different aspects of the neurobiology of decision making. The framework allows us to bring together recent findings in the field, highlight some of the most important outstanding problems, define a common lexicon that bridges the different disciplines that inform neuroeconomics, and point the way to future applications.","Systemic osmoregulation is a vital process whereby changes in plasma osmolality, detected by osmoreceptors, modulate ingestive behaviour, sympathetic outflow and renal function to stabilize the tonicity and volume of the extracellular fluid. Furthermore, changes in the central processing of osmosensory signals are likely to affect the hydro-mineral balance and other related aspects of homeostasis, including thermoregulation and cardiovascular balance. Surprisingly little is known about how the brain orchestrates these responses. Here, recent advances in our understanding of the molecular, cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the central control of osmotic homeostasis in mammals are reviewed.","Experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that activating the immune system in the CNS can be destructive. However, other studies have shown that enhancing an immune response can be therapeutic, and several clinical trials have been initiated with the aim of boosting immune responses in the CNS of individuals with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we evaluate the controversies in the field and discuss the remaining scientific challenges that are associated with enhancing immune function in the CNS to treat neurological diseases.","Micturition, or urination, occurs involuntarily in infants and young children until the age of 3 to 5 years, after which it is regulated voluntarily. The neural circuitry that controls this process is complex and highly distributed: it involves pathways at many levels of the brain, the spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system and is mediated by multiple neurotransmitters. Diseases or injuries of the nervous system in adults can cause the re-emergence of involuntary or reflex micturition, leading to urinary incontinence. This is a major health problem, especially in those with neurological impairment. Here we review the neural control of micturition and how disruption of this control leads to abnormal storage and release of urine.","Schizophrenia is a highly debilitating mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the general population, yet it continues to be poorly understood. Recent studies have identified variations in several genes that are associated with this disorder in diverse populations, including those that encode neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4. The past few years have witnessed exciting progress in our knowledge of NRG1 and ErbB4 functions and the biological basis of the increased risk for schizophrenia that is potentially conferred by polymorphisms in the two genes. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which altered function of NRG1 and ErbB4 contributes to schizophrenia might eventually lead to the development of more effective therapeutics.","Perceptual decision making is the act of choosing one option or course of action from a set of alternatives on the basis of available sensory evidence. Thus, when we make such decisions, sensory information must be interpreted and translated into behaviour. Neurophysiological work in monkeys performing sensory discriminations, combined with computational modelling, has paved the way for neuroimaging studies that are aimed at understanding decision-related processes in the human brain. Here we review findings from human neuroimaging studies in conjunction with data analysis methods that can directly link decisions and signals in the human brain on a trial-by-trial basis. This leads to a new view about the neural basis of human perceptual decision-making processes.","Glutamate acts on postsynaptic glutamate receptors to mediate excitatory communication between neurons. The discovery that additional presynaptic glutamate receptors can modulate neurotransmitter release has added complexity to the way we view glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Here we review evidence of a physiological role for presynaptic glutamate receptors in neurotransmitter release. We compare the physiological roles of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in short- and long-term regulation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we discuss the physiological conditions that are necessary for their activation, the source of the glutamate that activates them, their mechanisms of action and their involvement in higher brain function.","A central aim of neuroscience is to map neural circuits, in order to learn how they account for mental activities and behaviours and how alterations in them lead to neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the methods that are currently available for visualizing circuits have severe limitations that make it extremely difficult to extract precise wiring diagrams from histological images. Here we review recent advances in this area, along with some of the opportunities that these advances present and the obstacles that remain.", ,"The mechanisms through which general anaesthetics, an extremely diverse group of drugs, cause reversible loss of consciousness have been a long-standing mystery. Gradually, a relatively small number of important molecular targets have emerged, and how these drugs act at the molecular level is becoming clearer. Finding the link between these molecular studies and anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness presents an enormous challenge, but comparisons with the features of natural sleep are helping us to understand how these drugs work and the neuronal pathways that they affect. Recent work suggests that the thalamus and the neuronal networks that regulate its activity are the key to understanding how anaesthetics cause loss of consciousness.","The input-output relationship of neuronal networks depends both on their synaptic connectivity and on the intrinsic properties of their neuronal elements. In addition to altered synaptic properties, profound changes in intrinsic neuronal properties are observed in many CNS disorders. These changes reflect alterations in the functional properties of dendritic and somatic voltage- and Ca2+-gated ion channels. The molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic plasticity comprise the highly specific transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of ion-channel expression, trafficking and function. The studies reviewed here show that intrinsic plasticity, in conjunction with synaptic plasticity, can fundamentally alter the input-output properties of neuronal networks in CNS disorders.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2008 Jun;9(6):494.,"Synaptic plasticity is a key component of the learning machinery in the brain. It is vital that such plasticity be tightly regulated so that it occurs to the proper extent at the proper time. Activity-dependent mechanisms that have been collectively termed metaplasticity have evolved to help implement these essential computational constraints. Various intercellular signalling molecules can trigger lasting changes in the ability of synapses to express plasticity; their mechanisms of action are reviewed here, along with a consideration of how metaplasticity might affect learning and clinical conditions.", ,"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate most fast synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain, controlling activity at both the network and the cellular levels. The diverse functions of GABA in the CNS are matched not just by the heterogeneity of GABA(A)Rs, but also by the complex trafficking mechanisms and protein-protein interactions that generate and maintain an appropriate receptor cell-surface localization. In this Review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the dynamic regulation of GABA(A)R composition, trafficking to and from the neuronal surface, and lateral movement of receptors between synaptic and extrasynaptic locations. Finally, we highlight a number of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and schizophrenia, in which alterations in GABA(A)R trafficking occur.","Pain and pleasure are powerful motivators of behaviour and have historically been considered opposites. Emerging evidence from the pain and reward research fields points to extensive similarities in the anatomical substrates of painful and pleasant sensations. Recent molecular-imaging and animal studies have demonstrated the important role of the opioid and dopamine systems in modulating both pain and pleasure. Understanding the mutually inhibitory effects that pain and reward processing have on each other, and the neural mechanisms that underpin such modulation, is important for alleviating unnecessary suffering and improving well-being.","The term 'social brain' refers to the network of brain regions that are involved in understanding others. Behaviour that is related to social cognition changes dramatically during human adolescence. This is paralleled by functional changes that occur in the social brain during this time, in particular in the medial prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, which show altered activity during the performance of social cognitive tasks, such as face recognition and mental-state attribution. Research also indicates that, in humans, these parts of the social brain undergo structural development, including synaptic reorganization, during adolescence. Bringing together two relatively new and rapidly expanding areas of neuroscience--social neuroscience and the study of brain development during adolescence--will increase our understanding of how the social brain develops during adolescence.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci.2008 May;9(5):406.,A striking way in which humans differ from non-human primates is in their ability to represent numerical quantity using abstract symbols and to use these 'mental tools' to perform skills such as exact calculations. How do functional brain circuits for the symbolic representation of numerical magnitude emerge? Do neural representations of numerical magnitude change as a function of development and the learning of mental arithmetic? Current theories suggest that cultural number symbols acquire their meaning by being mapped onto non-symbolic representations of numerical magnitude. This Review provides an evaluation of this contention and proposes hypotheses to guide investigations into the neural mechanisms that constrain the acquisition of cultural representations of numerical magnitude.,"Noise--random disturbances of signals--poses a fundamental problem for information processing and affects all aspects of nervous-system function. However, the nature, amount and impact of noise in the nervous system have only recently been addressed in a quantitative manner. Experimental and computational methods have shown that multiple noise sources contribute to cellular and behavioural trial-to-trial variability. We review the sources of noise in the nervous system, from the molecular to the behavioural level, and show how noise contributes to trial-to-trial variability. We highlight how noise affects neuronal networks and the principles the nervous system applies to counter detrimental effects of noise, and briefly discuss noise's potential benefits.",The intricate neuronal circuitry of the cerebellum is thought to encode internal models that reproduce the dynamic properties of body parts. These models are essential for controlling the movement of these body parts: they allow the brain to precisely control the movement without the need for sensory feedback. It is thought that the cerebellum might also encode internal models that reproduce the essential properties of mental representations in the cerebral cortex. This hypothesis suggests a possible mechanism by which intuition and implicit thought might function and explains some of the symptoms that are exhibited by psychiatric patients. This article examines the conceptual bases and experimental evidence for this hypothesis.,"A number of recent studies have demonstrated a role for state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods in the assessment of patients in the vegetative state and other so-called 'disorders of consciousness'. In several cases, functional MRI has been used to show that aspects of speech perception, emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in some patients who behaviourally meet all of the criteria that define the vegetative state. This work has profound implications for clinical care, diagnosis, prognosis and medical-legal decision making (relating to the prolongation, or otherwise, of life after severe brain injury), as well as for more basic scientific questions about the nature of consciousness and the neural representation of our own thoughts and intentions.","Dystonias comprise a group of movement disorders that are characterized by involuntary movements and postures. Insight into the nature of neuronal dysfunction has been provided by the identification of genes responsible for primary dystonias, the characterization of animal models and functional evaluations and in vivo brain imaging of patients with dystonia. The data suggest that alterations in neuronal development and communication within the brain create a susceptible substratum for dystonia. Although there is no overt neurodegeneration in most forms of dystonia, there are functional and microstructural brain alterations. Dystonia offers a window into the mechanisms whereby subtle changes in neuronal function, particularly in sensorimotor circuits that are associated with motor learning and memory, can corrupt normal coordination and lead to a disabling motor disorder.","Pyramidal neurons are characterized by their distinct apical and basal dendritic trees and the pyramidal shape of their soma. They are found in several regions of the CNS and, although the reasons for their abundance remain unclear, functional studies--especially of CA1 hippocampal and layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons--have offered insights into the functions of their unique cellular architecture. Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional principles can be identified. In particular, the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to action-potential generation. These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity.","The hippocampus appears to be crucial for long-term episodic memory, yet its precise role remains elusive. Electrophysiological studies in rodents offer a useful starting point for developing models of hippocampal processing in the spatial domain. Here we review one such model that points to an essential role for the hippocampus in the construction of mental images. We explain how this neural-level mechanistic account addresses some of the current controversies in the field, such as the role of the hippocampus in imagery and short-term memory, and discuss its broader implications for the neural bases of episodic memory.","The appeal of in vivo cellular imaging to any neuroscientist is not hard to understand: it is almost impossible to isolate individual neurons while keeping them and their complex interactions with surrounding tissue intact. These interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.","It is anticipated that by 2040 neurodegeneration will affect 40 million people worldwide, more than twice as many as today. The traditional neurocentric view holds that neurodegeneration is caused primarily by intrinsic neuronal defects. However, recent evidence indicates that the millions of blood vessels that criss-cross the nervous system might not be the silent bystanders they were originally considered. Indeed, recent genetic studies reveal that insufficient production of angiogenic signals, which stimulate the growth of blood vessels, can cause neurodegeneration. Remarkably, some angiogenic factors can also regulate neuroregeneration, and have direct neuroprotective and other effects on various neural cell types. Here we provide an overview of the molecules that affect both neural and vascular cell processes--to underline their duality, we term them angioneurins. Unravelling the molecular mechanisms by which these angioneurins act might create opportunities for developing new neurovascular medicine.","The current view of brain organization supports the notion that there is a considerable degree of functional specialization and that many regions can be conceptualized as either 'affective' or 'cognitive'. Popular examples are the amygdala in the domain of emotion and the lateral prefrontal cortex in the case of cognition. This prevalent view is problematic for a number of reasons. Here, I will argue that complex cognitive-emotional behaviours have their basis in dynamic coalitions of networks of brain areas, none of which should be conceptualized as specifically affective or cognitive. Central to cognitive-emotional interactions are brain areas with a high degree of connectivity, called hubs, which are critical for regulating the flow and integration of information between regions.","Higher-order actin-based networks (actin superstructures) are important for growth-cone motility and guidance. Principles for generating, organizing and remodelling actin superstructures have emerged from recent findings in cell-free systems, non-neuronal cells and growth cones. This Review examines how actin superstructures are initiated de novo at the leading-edge membrane and how the spontaneous organization of actin superstructures is driven by ensembles of actin-binding proteins. How the regulation of actin-binding proteins can affect growth-cone turning and axonal regeneration is also discussed.","In 1970 the Boulder Committee described the basic principles of the development of the CNS, derived from observations on the human embryonic cerebrum. Since then, numerous studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of the timing, sequence and complexity of developmental events, and revealed important inter-species differences. We review current data on the development of the human cerebral cortex and update the classical model of how the structure that makes us human is formed.","Mutations resulting in reduced or completely abrogated serotonin-transporter (SERT) function in mice have led to the identification of more than 50 different phenotypic changes, ranging from increased anxiety and stress-related behaviours to gut dysfunction, bone weakness and late-onset obesity with metabolic syndrome. These multiple effects, which can be amplified by gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, are primarily attributable to altered intracellular and extracellular serotonin concentrations during development and adulthood. Much of the human data relating to altered expression of the gene that encodes SERT are based on genetic-association findings or correlations and are therefore not as robust as the experimental mouse results. Nevertheless, SERT-function-modifying gene variants in humans apparently produce many phenotypes that are similar to those that manifest themselves in mice.","Neuroimaging research over the past decade has revealed a detailed picture of the functional organization of the human brain. Here we focus on two fundamental questions that are raised by the detailed mapping of sensory and cognitive functions and illustrate these questions with findings from the object-vision pathway. First, are functionally specific regions that are located close together best understood as distinct cortical modules or as parts of a larger-scale cortical map? Second, what functional properties define each cortical map or module? We propose a model in which overlapping continuous maps of simple features give rise to discrete modules that are selective for complex stimuli.","A train of action potentials (a spike train) can carry information in both the average firing rate and the pattern of spikes in the train. But can such a spike-pattern code be supported by cortical circuits? Neurons in vitro produce a spike pattern in response to the injection of a fluctuating current. However, cortical neurons in vivo are modulated by local oscillatory neuronal activity and by top-down inputs. In a cortical circuit, precise spike patterns thus reflect the interaction between internally generated activity and sensory information encoded by input spike trains. We review the evidence for precise and reliable spike timing in the cortex and discuss its computational role.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2012 Dec;13(12):878.,"An emerging body of multidisciplinary literature has documented the beneficial influence of physical activity engendered through aerobic exercise on selective aspects of brain function. Human and non-human animal studies have shown that aerobic exercise can improve a number of aspects of cognition and performance. Lack of physical activity, particularly among children in the developed world, is one of the major causes of obesity. Exercise might not only help to improve their physical health, but might also improve their academic performance. This article examines the positive effects of aerobic physical activity on cognition and brain function, at the molecular, cellular, systems and behavioural levels. A growing number of studies support the idea that physical exercise is a lifestyle factor that might lead to increased physical and mental health throughout life.","Neurons have a constantly high glucose demand, and unlike muscle cells they cannot accommodate episodic glucose uptake under the influence of insulin. Neuronal glucose uptake depends on the extracellular concentration of glucose, and cellular damage can ensue after persistent episodes of hyperglycaemia--a phenomenon referred to as glucose neurotoxicity. This article reviews the pathophysiological manifestation of raised glucose in neurons and how this can explain the major components of diabetic neuropathy.","A successful pregnancy requires multiple adaptations of the mother's physiology to optimize fetal growth and development, to protect the fetus from adverse programming, to provide impetus for timely parturition and to ensure that adequate maternal care is provided after parturition. Many of these adaptations are organized by the mother's brain, predominantly through changes in neuroendocrine systems, and these changes are primarily driven by the hormones of pregnancy. By contrast, adaptations in the mother's brain during lactation are maintained by external stimuli from the young. The changes in pregnancy are not necessarily innocuous: they may predispose the mother to post-partum mood disorders.","In response to a peripheral infection, innate immune cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on the brain to cause sickness behaviour. When activation of the peripheral immune system continues unabated, such as during systemic infections, cancer or autoimmune diseases, the ensuing immune signalling to the brain can lead to an exacerbation of sickness and the development of symptoms of depression in vulnerable individuals. These phenomena might account for the increased prevalence of clinical depression in physically ill people. Inflammation is therefore an important biological event that might increase the risk of major depressive episodes, much like the more traditional psychosocial factors.","Polysialic acid (PSA) is a cell-surface glycan with an enormous hydrated volume that serves to modulate the distance between cells. This regulation has direct effects on several cellular mechanisms that underlie the formation of the vertebrate nervous system, most conspicuously in the migration and differentiation of progenitor cells and the growth and targeting of axons. PSA is also involved in a number of plasticity-related responses in the adult CNS, including changes in circadian and hormonal patterns, adaptations to pain and stress, and aspects of learning and memory. The ability of PSA to increase the plasticity of neural cells is being exploited to improve the repair of adult CNS tissue.","Mr M, a patient with semantic dementia--a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the gradual deterioration of semantic memory--was being driven through the countryside to visit a friend and was able to remind his wife where to turn along the not-recently-travelled route. Then, pointing at the sheep in the field, he asked her ""What are those things?"" Prior to the onset of symptoms in his late 40s, this man had normal semantic memory. What has gone wrong in his brain to produce this dramatic and selective erosion of conceptual knowledge?","Charles Darwin appreciated the conceptual difficulty in accepting that an organ as wonderful as the vertebrate eye could have evolved through natural selection. He reasoned that if appropriate gradations could be found that were useful to the animal and were inherited, then the apparent difficulty would be overcome. Here, we review a wide range of findings that capture glimpses of the gradations that appear to have occurred during eye evolution, and provide a scenario for the unseen steps that have led to the emergence of the vertebrate eye.","Our understanding of how the enormously complex task of interconnecting millions of nerve cells is accomplished remains rudimentary. What molecular mechanisms control its exquisite specificity? Can we pinpoint single molecular interactions that might help to explain some of the specificity requirements that underlie neuronal wiring? A series of recent studies on the molecular diversity of the Drosophila melanogaster cell-surface receptor Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule (Dscam) provide one exceptional example of a novel mechanistic model of neuronal-wiring specificity, progressing from structural studies of single protein-protein interactions to biochemical analysis in vitro and to an understanding of complex neuronal differentiation at the single-cell or tissue levels.","Traditionally, glutamate transporters have been viewed as membrane proteins that harness the electrochemical gradient to slowly transport glutamate from the extracellular space into glial cells. However, recent studies have shown that glutamate transporters on glial and neuronal membranes also rapidly bind released glutamate to shape synaptic transmission. In this Review, we summarize the properties of glutamate transporters that influence synaptic transmission and are subject to regulation and plasticity. We highlight how the diversity of glutamate-transporter function relates to transporter location, density and affinity.","Post-translational protein modifications are integral components of signalling cascades that enable cells to efficiently, rapidly and reversibly respond to extracellular stimuli. These modifications have crucial roles in the CNS, where the communication between neurons is particularly complex. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine residues in target proteins. It is well established that SUMOylation controls many aspects of nuclear function, but it is now clear that it is also a key determinant in many extranuclear neuronal processes, and it has also been implicated in a wide range of neuropathological conditions.","Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of membrane transport proteins that have been shown to be sensitive to the abundance of phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane. These proteins include voltage-gated potassium and calcium channels, ion channels that mediate sensory and nociceptive responses, epithelial transport proteins and ionic exchangers. Each of the regulatory lipids is also under multifaceted regulatory control. Phosphoinositide modulation of membrane proteins in neurons often has a dramatic effect on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmitter release. The repertoire of lipid signalling mechanisms that regulate membrane proteins is intriguingly complex and provides a rich array of topics for neuroscience research.","Chemokines are not only found in the immune system or expressed in inflammatory conditions: they are constitutively present in the brain in both glial cells and neurons. Recently, the possibility has been raised that they might act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Although the evidence is incomplete, emerging data show that chemokines have several of the characteristics that define neurotransmitters. Moreover, their physiological actions resemble those of neuromodulators in the sense that chemokines usually have few effects by themselves in basal conditions, but modify the induced release of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides. These findings, together with the pharmacological development of agonists and antagonists that are selective for chemokine receptors and can cross the blood-brain barrier, open a new era of research in neuroscience.",Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2008 May;9(5):405; author reply 405.,"The cranial motor nerves control muscles involved in eye, head and neck movements, feeding, speech and facial expression. The generic and specific properties of cranial motor neurons depend on a matrix of rostrocaudal and dorsoventral patterning information. Repertoires of transcription factors, including Hox genes, confer generic and specific properties on motor neurons, and endow subpopulations at various axial levels with the ability to navigate to their targets. Cranial motor axon projections are guided by diffusible cues and aided by guideposts, such as nerve exit points, glial cells and muscle primordia. The recent identification of genes that are mutated in human cranial dysinnervation disorders is now shedding light on the functional consequences of perturbations of cranial motor neuron development.","Addiction is caused, in part, by powerful and long-lasting memories of the drug experience. Relapse caused by exposure to cues associated with the drug experience is a major clinical problem that contributes to the persistence of addiction. Here we present the accumulated evidence that drugs of abuse can hijack synaptic plasticity mechanisms in key brain circuits, most importantly in the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is central to reward processing in the brain. Reversing or preventing these drug-induced synaptic modifications may prove beneficial in the treatment of one of society's most intractable health problems.","In a small fraction of mammalian genes--at present estimated at less than 1% of the total--one of the two alleles that is inherited by the offspring is partially or completely switched off. The decision as to which one is silenced depends on which allele was inherited from the mother and which from the father. These idiosyncratic loci are known as imprinted genes, and their existence is an evolutionary enigma, as they effectively nullify the advantages of diploidy. Although they are small in number, these genes have important effects on physiology and behaviour, and many are expressed in the brain. There is increasing evidence that imprinted genes influence brain function and behaviour by affecting neurodevelopmental processes.","Cannabis has been known for at least 4,000 years to have profound effects on the mind--effects that have provoked dramatically divergent attitudes towards it. Some societies have regarded cannabis as a sacred boon for mankind that offers respite from the tribulations of everyday life, whereas others have demonized it as inevitably leading to 'reefer madness'. The debate between the protagonists and prohibitionists has recently been re-ignited, but unfortunately this debate continues mainly in ignorance of our new understanding of the effects of cannabis on the brain and of studies that have quantified the extent of the risks of long-term use.","Alternative pre-mRNA splicing has an important role in the control of neuronal gene expression. Many neuronal proteins are structurally diversified through the differential inclusion and exclusion of sequences in the final spliced mRNA. Here, we discuss common mechanisms of splicing regulation and provide examples of how alternative splicing has important roles in neuronal development and mature neuron function. Finally, we describe regulatory proteins that control the splicing of some neuronally expressed transcripts.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Nov;8(11):2p following 903.,"Biological pacemakers dictate our daily schedules in physiology and behaviour. The molecules, cells and networks that underlie these circadian rhythms can now be monitored using long-term cellular imaging and electrophysiological tools, and initial studies have already suggested a theme--circadian clocks may be crucial for widespread changes in brain activity and plasticity. These daily changes can modify the amount or activity of available genes, transcripts, proteins, ions and other biologically active molecules, ultimately determining cellular properties such as excitability and connectivity. Recently discovered circadian molecules and cells provide preliminary insights into a network that adapts to predictable daily and seasonal changes while remaining robust in the face of other perturbations.","At the end of the 1980s, it was clearly demonstrated that cells produce nitric oxide and that this gaseous molecule is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems, rather than simply being a toxic pollutant. In the CNS, nitric oxide has an array of functions, such as the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the sleep-wake cycle and hormone secretion. Particularly interesting is the role of nitric oxide as a Janus molecule in the cell death or survival mechanisms in brain cells. In fact, physiological amounts of this gas are neuroprotective, whereas higher concentrations are clearly neurotoxic.","Retinoic acid (RA) is involved in the induction of neural differentiation, motor axon outgrowth and neural patterning. Like other developmental molecules, RA continues to play a role after development has been completed. Elevated RA signalling in the adult triggers axon outgrowth and, consequently, nerve regeneration. RA is also involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state of adult neurons, and disruption of RA signalling in the adult leads to the degeneration of motor neurons (motor neuron disease), the development of Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, the development of Parkinson's disease. The data described here strongly suggest that RA could be used as a therapeutic molecule for the induction of axon regeneration and the treatment of neurodegeneration.","Nerve cells mould the lipid fabric of their membranes to ease vesicle fusion, regulate ion fluxes and create specialized microenvironments that contribute to cellular communication. The chemical diversity of membrane lipids controls protein traffic, facilitates recognition between cells and leads to the production of hundreds of molecules that carry information both within and across cells. With so many roles, it is no wonder that lipids make up half of the human brain in dry weight. The objective of neural lipidomics is to understand how these molecules work together; this difficult task will greatly benefit from technical advances that might enable the testing of emerging hypotheses.","Many cellular functions require the synthesis of a specific protein or functional cohort of proteins at a specific time and place in the cell. Local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites is essential for understanding how neural activity patterns are transduced into persistent changes in synaptic connectivity during cortical development, memory storage and other long-term adaptive brain responses. Regional and temporal changes in protein levels are commonly coordinated by an asymmetric distribution of mRNAs. This Review attempts to integrate current knowledge of dendritic mRNA transport, storage and translation, placing particular emphasis on the coordination of regulation and function during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn2169-c1 PMID: 17848964  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher],"To date, the diagnosis of mental disorders has been based on clinical observation, specifically: the identification of symptoms that tend to cluster together, the timing of the symptoms' appearance, and their tendency to resolve, recur or become chronic. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Disease, the manuals that specify these diagnoses and the criteria for making them, are currently undergoing revision. It is thus timely to ask whether neuroscience has progressed to the point that the next editions of these manuals can usefully incorporate information about brain structure and function.","During brain development, one of the most important structures is the subventricular zone (SVZ), from which most neurons are generated. In adulthood the SVZ maintains a pool of progenitor cells that continuously replace neurons in the olfactory bulb. Neurodegenerative diseases induce a substantial upregulation or downregulation of SVZ progenitor cell proliferation, depending on the type of disorder. Far from being a dormant layer, the SVZ responds to neurodegenerative disease in a way that makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","The majority of functional neuroscience studies have focused on the brain's response to a task or stimulus. However, the brain is very active even in the absence of explicit input or output. In this Article we review recent studies examining spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional magnetic resonance imaging as a potentially important and revealing manifestation of spontaneous neuronal activity. Although several challenges remain, these studies have provided insight into the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain, variability in behaviour and potential physiological correlates of neurological and psychiatric disease.","Rapid memory formation relies, at least in part, on long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses. Inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus, which are essential for information processing, have recently been found to exhibit not one, but two forms of LTP. One form resembles LTP that occurs in pyramidal neurons, which depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and is triggered by coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The other depends on Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptors that preferentially open when the postsynaptic neuron is at rest. Here we review these contrasting forms of LTP and describe how they are mirrored by two forms of long-term depression. We further discuss how the remarkable plasticity of glutamatergic synapses on interneurons greatly enhances the computational capacity of the cortical microcircuit.","In many areas of the vertebrate brain, such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, neural circuits rely on inhibition mediated by GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) to shape the spatiotemporal patterns of electrical signalling. The richness and subtlety of inhibition are achieved by diverse classes of interneurons that are endowed with distinct physiological properties. In addition, the axons of interneurons display highly characteristic and class-specific geometry and innervation patterns, and thereby distribute their output to discrete spatial domains, cell types and subcellular compartments in neural networks. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that specify and modify inhibitory innervation patterns are only just beginning to be understood.","A rapidly growing number of recent studies show that imagining the future depends on much of the same neural machinery that is needed for remembering the past. These findings have led to the concept of the prospective brain; an idea that a crucial function of the brain is to use stored information to imagine, simulate and predict possible future events. We suggest that processes such as memory can be productively re-conceptualized in light of this idea.","Advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, which are characterized by prominent CNS accumulations of fibrillar tau inclusions, are rapidly moving this previously underexplored disease pathway to centre stage for disease-modifying drug discovery efforts. However, controversies abound concerning whether or not the deleterious effects of tau pathologies result from toxic gains-of-function by pathological tau or from critical losses of normal tau function in the disease state. This Review summarizes the most recent advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms of tau-mediated neurodegeneration to forge an integrated concept of those tau-linked disease processes that drive the onset and progression of AD and related tauopathies.","The human body, like the human face, is a rich source of socially relevant information about other individuals. Evidence from studies of both humans and non-human primates points to focal regions of the higher-level visual cortex that are specialized for the visual perception of the body. These body-selective regions, which can be dissociated from regions involved in face perception, have been implicated in the perception of the self and the 'body schema', the perception of others' emotions and the understanding of actions.","Despite aggressive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, malignant gliomas remain uniformly fatal. To progress, these tumours stimulate the formation of new blood vessels through processes driven primarily by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the resulting vessels are structurally and functionally abnormal, and contribute to a hostile microenvironment (low oxygen tension and high interstitial fluid pressure) that selects for a more malignant phenotype with increased morbidity and mortality. Emerging preclinical and clinical data indicate that anti-VEGF therapies are potentially effective in glioblastoma--the most frequent primary brain tumour--and can transiently normalize tumour vessels. This creates a window of opportunity for optimally combining chemotherapeutics and radiation.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Sep;8(9):732.,"From a wealth of experimental findings, derived from both in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is becoming clear that fibroblast growth factors regulate processes that are central to all aspects of nervous system development. Some of these functions are well known, whereas others, such as the roles of these proteins in axon guidance and synaptogenesis, have been established only recently. The emergent picture is one of remarkable economy, in which this family of ligands is deployed and redeployed at successive developmental stages to sculpt the nervous system.","The properties of synaptic transmission were first elucidated at the neuromuscular junction. More recent work has examined transmission at synapses within the brain. Here we review the remarkable progress in understanding the biophysical and molecular basis of the sequential steps in this process. These steps include the elevation of Ca2+ in microdomains of the presynaptic terminal, the diffusion of transmitter through the fusion pore into the synaptic cleft and the activation of postsynaptic receptors. The results give insight into the factors that control the precision of quantal transmission and provide a framework for understanding synaptic plasticity.","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits for patients with otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective disorders. This technique is not only clinically useful, but it can also provide new insights into fundamental brain functions through direct manipulation of both local and distributed brain networks in many different species. In particular, DBS can be used in conjunction with non-invasive neuroimaging methods such as magnetoencephalography to map the fundamental mechanisms of normal and abnormal oscillatory synchronization that underlie human brain function. The precise mechanisms of action for DBS remain uncertain, but here we give an up-to-date overview of the principles of DBS, its neural mechanisms and its potential future applications.","Music performance is both a natural human activity, present in all societies, and one of the most complex and demanding cognitive challenges that the human mind can undertake. Unlike most other sensory-motor activities, music performance requires precise timing of several hierarchically organized actions, as well as precise control over pitch interval production, implemented through diverse effectors according to the instrument involved. We review the cognitive neuroscience literature of both motor and auditory domains, highlighting the value of studying interactions between these systems in a musical context, and propose some ideas concerning the role of the premotor cortex in integration of higher order features of music with appropriately timed and organized actions.","Unchecked aggression and violence exact a significant toll on human societies. Aggression is an umbrella term for behaviours that are intended to inflict harm. These behaviours evolved as adaptations to deal with competition, but when expressed out of context, they can have destructive consequences. Uncontrolled aggression has several components, such as impaired recognition of social cues and enhanced impulsivity. Molecular approaches to the study of aggression have revealed biological signals that mediate the components of aggressive behaviour. These signals may provide targets for therapeutic intervention for individuals with extreme aggressive outbursts. This Review summarizes the complex interactions between genes, biological signals, neural circuits and the environment that influence the development and expression of aggressive behaviour.","No sensory stimulus is an island unto itself; rather, it can only properly be interpreted in light of the stimuli that surround it in space and time. This can result in entertaining illusions and puzzling results in psychological and neurophysiological experiments. We concentrate on perhaps the best studied test case, namely orientation or tilt, which gives rise to the notorious tilt illusion and the adaptation tilt after-effect. We review the empirical literature and discuss the computational and statistical ideas that are battling to explain these conundrums, and thereby gain favour as more general accounts of cortical processing.","Ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily are involved in a wide variety of neural signalling processes, most prominently in sensory receptor cells. They are essential for mechanosensation in systems ranging from fruitfly hearing, to nematode touch, to mouse mechanical pain. However, it is unclear in many instances whether a TRP channel directly transduces the mechanical stimulus or is part of a downstream signalling pathway. Here, we propose criteria for establishing direct mechanical activation of ion channels and review these criteria in a number of mechanosensory systems in which TRP channels are involved.","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has in recent years been used to explore therapeutic opportunities in a bewildering variety of conditions. Although there is good evidence that this technique can modify cortical activity, the rationale for its use in many of the conditions investigated so far is not clear. Here we discuss the effects of rTMS in healthy subjects and how it has been used in a number of neurological conditions. We argue that a better understanding of both the effects of rTMS and the pathological processes underlying the conditions for which it is used will reveal whether rTMS really does offer therapeutic potential and, if so, for which conditions.","The primal role that the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has in the development of Alzheimer's disease is now almost universally accepted. It is also well recognized that Abeta exists in multiple assembly states, which have different physiological or pathophysiological effects. Although the classical view is that Abeta is deposited extracellularly, emerging evidence from transgenic mice and human patients indicates that this peptide can also accumulate intraneuronally, which may contribute to disease progression.","It is now widely accepted that neurogenesis occurs in two regions of the adult mammalian brain--the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. There is evidence for adult neurogenesis in several additional areas, including the neocortex, striatum, amygdala and substantia nigra, but this has been difficult to replicate consistently other than in the damaged brain. The discrepancies may be due to variations in the sensitivity of the methods used to detect new neurons.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Jul;8(7):568.,"The action potential of the squid giant axon is formed by just two voltage-dependent conductances in the cell membrane, yet mammalian central neurons typically express more than a dozen different types of voltage-dependent ion channels. This rich repertoire of channels allows neurons to encode information by generating action potentials with a wide range of shapes, frequencies and patterns. Recent work offers an increasingly detailed understanding of how the expression of particular channel types underlies the remarkably diverse firing behaviour of various types of neurons.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Jul;8(7):568.,"In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the specification of projection neurons within the mammalian neocortex. New experimental approaches have made it possible to identify progenitors and study the lineage relationships of different neocortical projection neurons. An expanding set of genes with layer and neuronal subtype specificity have been identified within the neocortex, and their function during projection neuron development is starting to be elucidated. Here, we assess recent data regarding the nature of neocortical progenitors, review the roles of individual genes in projection neuron specification and discuss the implications for progenitor plasticity.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Jul;8(7):568.,"Our ability to coordinate the use of our left and right eyes and to make use of subtle differences between the images received by each eye allows us to perceive stereoscopic depth, which is important for the visual perception of three-dimensional space. Binocular neurons in the visual cortex combine signals from the left and right eyes. Probing the roles of binocular neurons in different perceptual tasks has advanced our understanding of the stages within the visual cortex that lead to binocular depth perception.","Adult CNS neurons are typically described as permanently postmitotic but there is probably nothing permanent about the neuronal cell cycle arrest. Rather, it appears that these highly differentiated cells must constantly keep their cell cycle in check. Relaxation of this vigilance leads to the initiation of a cell cycle and entrance into an altered and vulnerable state, often leading to death. There is evidence that neurons which are at risk of neurodegeneration are also at risk of re-initiating a cell cycle process that involves the expression of cell cycle proteins and DNA replication. Failure of cell cycle regulation might be a root cause of several neurodegenerative disorders and a final common pathway for others.","Many neurological and most psychiatric disorders are not due to mutations in a single gene; rather, they involve molecular disturbances entailing multiple genes and signals that control their expression. Recent research has demonstrated that complex 'epigenetic' mechanisms, which regulate gene activity without altering the DNA code, have long-lasting effects within mature neurons. This review summarizes recent evidence for the existence of sustained epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in neurons that have been implicated in the regulation of complex behaviour, including abnormalities in several psychiatric disorders such as depression, drug addiction and schizophrenia.","A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits encode memory and guide behaviour. Studying simple, genetically tractable organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, can illuminate principles of neural circuit organization and function. Early genetic dissection of D. melanogaster olfactory memory focused on individual genes and molecules. These molecular tags subsequently revealed key neural circuits for memory. Recent advances in genetic technology have allowed us to manipulate and observe activity in these circuits, and even individual neurons, in live animals. The studies have transformed D. melanogaster from a useful organism for gene discovery to an ideal model to understand neural circuit function in memory.","The establishment of functional neural connections requires the growth of axons to specific target areas and the formation of synapses with appropriate synaptic partners. Several molecules that regulate axon guidance and synapse formation have been identified in the past decade, but it is unclear how a relatively limited number of factors can specify a large number of connections. Recent evidence indicates that transcription factors make a crucial contribution to the specification of connections in the nervous system by coordinating the response of neurons to guidance molecules and neurotransmitters.","Despite decades of research, the functional neuroanatomy of speech processing has been difficult to characterize. A major impediment to progress may have been the failure to consider task effects when mapping speech-related processing systems. We outline a dual-stream model of speech processing that remedies this situation. In this model, a ventral stream processes speech signals for comprehension, and a dorsal stream maps acoustic speech signals to frontal lobe articulatory networks. The model assumes that the ventral stream is largely bilaterally organized--although there are important computational differences between the left- and right-hemisphere systems--and that the dorsal stream is strongly left-hemisphere dominant.","Animals, in particular humans, frequently punish other individuals who behave negatively or uncooperatively towards them. In animals, this usually serves to protect the personal interests of the individual concerned, and its kin. However, humans also punish altruistically, in which the act of punishing is personally costly. The propensity to do so has been proposed to reflect the cultural acquisition of norms of behaviour, which incorporates the desire to uphold equity and fairness, and promotes cooperation. Here, we review the proximate neurobiological basis of punishment, considering the motivational processes that underlie punishing actions.","Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), a failure to develop the large bundle of fibres that connect the cerebral hemispheres, occurs in 1:4000 individuals. Genetics, animal models and detailed structural neuroimaging are now providing insights into the developmental and molecular bases of AgCC. Studies using neuropsychological, electroencephalogram and functional MRI approaches are examining the resulting impairments in emotional and social functioning, and have begun to explore the functional neuroanatomy underlying impaired higher-order cognition. The study of AgCC could provide insight into the integrated cerebral functioning of healthy brains, and may offer a model for understanding certain psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia and autism.","Some fundamental principles of colour vision, deduced from perceptual studies, have been understood for a long time. Physiological studies have confirmed the existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms; and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.","Two-pore-domain K(+) (K(2P)) channel subunits are made up of four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains that are arranged in tandem and function as either homo- or heterodimeric channels. This structural motif is associated with unusual gating properties, including background channel activity and sensitivity to membrane stretch. Moreover, K(2P) channels are modulated by a variety of cellular lipids and pharmacological agents, including polyunsaturated fatty acids and volatile general anaesthetics. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that TREK1, the most thoroughly studied K(2P) channel, has a key role in the cellular mechanisms of neuroprotection, anaesthesia, pain and depression.","Memory reconsolidation has been argued to be a distinct process that serves to maintain, strengthen or modify memories. Specifically, the retrieval of a previously consolidated memory has been hypothesized to induce an additional activity-dependent labile period during which the memory can be modified. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of reconsolidation could provide crucial insights into the dynamic aspects of normal mnemonic function and psychiatric disorders that are characterized by exceptionally strong and salient emotional memories.","Damage to nerve fibre pathways results in a devastating loss of function, due to the disconnection of nerve fibres from their targets. However, some recovery does occur and this has been correlated with the formation of new (albeit abnormal) connections. The view that an untapped growth potential resides in the adult CNS has led to various attempts to stimulate the repair of disconnectional injuries. A key factor in the failure of axonal regeneration in the CNS after injury is the loss of the aligned glial pathways that nerve fibres require for their elongation. Transplantation of cultured adult olfactory ensheathing cells into lesions is being investigated as a procedure to re-establish glial pathways permissive for the regeneration of severed axons.","Neuropoietic cytokines are well known for their role in the control of neuronal, glial and immune responses to injury or disease. Since this discovery, it has emerged that several of these proteins are also involved in nervous system development, in particular in the regulation of neurogenesis and stem cell fate. Recent data indicate that these proteins have yet more functions, as key modulators of synaptic plasticity and of various behaviours. In addition, neuropoietic cytokines might be a factor in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders.","After they are born and differentiate, neurons break their previous symmetry, dramatically change their shape, and establish two structurally and functionally distinct compartments - axons and dendrites - within one cell. How do neurons develop their morphologically and molecularly distinct compartments? Recent studies have implicated several signalling pathways evoked by extracellular signals as having essential roles in a number of aspects of neuronal polarization.","In neurons, intracellular calcium signals have crucial roles in activating neurotransmitter release and in triggering alterations in neuronal function. Calmodulin has been widely studied as a Ca(2+) sensor that has several defined roles in neuronal Ca(2+) signalling, but members of the neuronal calcium sensor protein family have also begun to emerge as key components in a number of regulatory pathways and have increased the diversity of neuronal Ca(2+) signalling pathways. The differing properties of these proteins allow them to have discrete, non-redundant functions.","Many cell adhesion molecules are localized at synaptic sites in neuronal axons and dendrites. These molecules bridge pre- and postsynaptic specializations but do far more than simply provide a mechanical link between cells. In this review, we will discuss the roles these proteins have during development and at mature synapses. Synaptic adhesion proteins participate in the formation, maturation, function and plasticity of synaptic connections. Together with conventional synaptic transmission mechanisms, these molecules are an important element in the trans-cellular communication mediated by synapses.","The increasing age of the population around the world has meant that greater attention is being paid to disorders that mainly affect older people. In particular, work is focusing on ways to preserve the healthy brain and prevent dementia. Preventive studies are complex and must take into account not only simple approaches such as those used in risk and outcome studies, but also stage of life, survival and mortality, and population context before their effect can be assessed. This paper presents questions and areas which must be explored if the potential for prevention of dementia during brain ageing is to be properly understood.","Sleep and wakefulness are regulated to occur at appropriate times that are in accordance with our internal and external environments. Avoiding danger and finding food, which are life-essential activities that are regulated by emotion, reward and energy balance, require vigilance and therefore, by definition, wakefulness. The orexin (hypocretin) system regulates sleep and wakefulness through interactions with systems that regulate emotion, reward and energy homeostasis.","Discoveries in the field of neuroscience are a natural source of discourse among scientists and have long been disseminated to the public. Historically, as news of findings has travelled between communities, it has elicited both expected and unusual reactions. What scientific landmarks promote discourse within the professional community? Do the same findings achieve a place in the public eye? How does the media choose what is newsworthy, and why does the public react the way it does? Drawing on examples of past challenges at the crossroads of neuroscience and society and on a case study of trends in one neurogenetic disease, autism, we explore the dialectical forces interacting in scientific and public discourse.","The generation and targeting of appropriate numbers and types of neurons to where they are needed in the brain is essential for the establishment, maintenance and modification of neural circuitry. This review aims to summarize the patterns, mechanisms and functional significance of neuronal migration in the postnatal brain, with an emphasis on the migratory events that persist in the mature brain.","During the development of the nervous system, many different types of neuron are produced. As well as forming the correct type of neuron, each must also establish precise connections. Recent findings show that, because of shared gene programmes, neuronal identity is intimately linked to and coordinated with axonal behaviour. Peripheral sensory neurons provide an excellent system in which to study these interactions. This review examines how neuronal diversity is created in the PNS and describes proteins that help to direct the diversity of neuronal subtypes, cell survival, axonal growth and the establishment of central patterns of modality-specific connections.","Activity-dependent changes in the strength of excitatory synapses are a cellular mechanism for the plasticity of neuronal networks that is widely recognized to underlie cognitive functions such as learning and memory. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are the main transducers of rapid excitatory transmission in the mammalian CNS, and recent discoveries indicate that the mechanisms which regulate AMPARs are more complex than previously thought. This review focuses on recent evidence that alterations to AMPAR functional properties are coupled to their trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics and local protein synthesis. These relationships offer new insights into the regulation of AMPARs and synaptic strength by cellular signalling.","The mitotic spindle is the cellular scaffold that facilitates proper segregation of genetic material during cell division. Far from being static, the spindle is a dynamically regulated tool that can alter its size, shape and position during mitosis. Work in both insect and vertebrate systems has shown that regulation of this structure involves an array of highly conserved proteins. Moreover, it is now clear that tight regulation of the spindle during the process of neurogenesis is paramount to proper cell division and generation of the nervous system as a whole.","Lipid rafts are specialized structures on the plasma membrane that have an altered lipid composition as well as links to the cytoskeleton. It has been proposed that these structures are membrane domains in which neurotransmitter signalling might occur through a clustering of receptors and components of receptor-activated signalling cascades. The localization of these proteins in lipid rafts, which is affected by the cytoskeleton, also influences the potency and efficacy of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The effect of lipid rafts on neurotransmitter signalling has also been implicated in neurological and psychiatric diseases.",The expression 'painful' can be used to describe both an embarrassing moment and a cut on the finger. An explanation for this dichotomy can be found in the convoluted history of ideas about pain. Whether pain is an independent sensation and the product of dedicated neural mechanisms continues to be a topic of debate. This overview concentrates on the issue of specificity together with other notable information regarding pain that has emerged since 1800.,"Mounting evidence indicates that microglial activation contributes to neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies show that in response to certain environmental toxins and endogenous proteins, microglia can enter an overactivated state and release reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause neurotoxicity. Pattern recognition receptors expressed on the microglial surface seem to be one of the primary, common pathways by which diverse toxin signals are transduced into ROS production. Overactivated microglia can be detected using imaging techniques and therefore this knowledge offers an opportunity not only for early diagnosis but, importantly, for the development of targeted anti-inflammatory therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative disease.","Gamma frequency oscillations are thought to provide a temporal structure for information processing in the brain. They contribute to cognitive functions, such as memory formation and sensory processing, and are disturbed in some psychiatric disorders. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing, soma-inhibiting interneurons have a key role in the generation of these oscillations. Experimental analysis in the hippocampus and the neocortex reveals that synapses among these interneurons are highly specialized. Computational analysis further suggests that synaptic specialization turns interneuron networks into robust gamma frequency oscillators.","Approximately 40 million people worldwide are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite HIV's known propensity to infect the CNS and cause neurological disease, HIV neurocognitive disorders remain under-recognized. Although combination antiretroviral therapy has improved the health of millions of those living with HIV, the penetration into the CNS of many such therapies is limited, and patients' quality of life continues to be diminished by milder, residual neurocognitive impairment. Synaptodendritic neuronal injury is emerging as an important mediator of such deficits in HIV. By carefully selecting specific antiretrovirals and supplementing them with neuroprotective agents, physicians might be able to facilitate innate CNS repair, promoting enhanced synaptodendritic plasticity, neural function and clinical neurological status.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Feb;8(2):160.,"Neural development and the organization of complex neuronal circuits involve a number of processes that require cell-cell interaction. During these processes, axons choose specific partners for synapse formation and dendrites elaborate arborizations by interacting with other dendrites. The cadherin superfamily is a group of cell surface receptors that is comprised of more than 100 members. The molecular structures and diversity within this family suggest that these molecules regulate the contacts or signalling between neurons in a variety of ways. In this review I discuss the roles of three subfamilies - classic cadherins, Flamingo/CELSRs and protocadherins - in the regulation of neuronal recognition and connectivity.","An influential concept in contemporary computational neuroscience is the reward prediction error hypothesis of phasic dopaminergic function. It maintains that midbrain dopaminergic neurons signal the occurrence of unpredicted reward, which is used in appetitive learning to reinforce existing actions that most often lead to reward. However, the availability of limited afferent sensory processing and the precise timing of dopaminergic signals suggest that they might instead have a central role in identifying which aspects of context and behavioural output are crucial in causing unpredicted events.","Atlases of the human brain have an important impact on neuroscience. The emergence of ever more sophisticated imaging techniques, brain mapping methods and analytical strategies has the potential to revolutionize the concept of the brain atlas. Atlases can now combine data describing multiple aspects of brain structure or function at different scales from different subjects, yielding a truly integrative and comprehensive description of this organ. These integrative approaches have provided significant impetus for the human brain mapping initiatives, and have important applications in health and disease.","The discovery of premotor and parietal cells known as mirror neurons in the macaque brain that fire not only when the animal is in action, but also when it observes others carrying out the same actions provides a plausible neurophysiological mechanism for a variety of important social behaviours, from imitation to empathy. Recent data also show that dysfunction of the mirror neuron system in humans might be a core deficit in autism, a socially isolating condition. Here, we review the neurophysiology of the mirror neuron system and its role in social cognition and discuss the clinical implications of mirror neuron dysfunction.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Recent studies have implicated specific sodium channel isoforms as having an important role in several aspects of the pathophysiology of MS, including the restoration of impulse conduction after demyelination, axonal degeneration and the mistuning of Purkinje neurons that leads to cerebellar dysfunction. By manipulating the activity of these channels or their expression, it might be possible to develop new therapeutic approaches that will prevent or limit disability in MS.","High-conductance, 'big' potassium (BK) channels encoded by the Slo gene family are among the largest and most complex of the extended family of potassium channels. The family of SLO channels apparently evolved from voltage-dependent potassium channels, but acquired a large conserved carboxyl extension, which allows channel gating to be altered in response to the direct sensing of several different intracellular ions, and by other second-messenger systems, such as those activated following neurotransmitter binding to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This versatility has been exploited to serve many cellular roles, both within and outside the nervous system.","A class of small, non-coding transcripts called microRNAs (miRNAs) that provide a crucial and pervasive layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation has recently emerged and become the focus of intense research. miRNAs are abundant in the nervous system, where they have key roles in development and are likely to be important mediators of plasticity. A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons. Although there are nearly 500 known human miRNA sequences, each of only approximately 21 nucleotides, which bind to multiple mRNA targets, the accurate prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp. Nevertheless, the identification of such targets promises to provide new insights into many facets of neuronal function.","Whenever food is placed in the mouth, taste receptors are stimulated. Simultaneously, different types of sensory fibre that monitor several food attributes such as texture, temperature and odour are activated. Here, we evaluate taste and oral somatosensory peripheral transduction mechanisms as well as the multi-sensory integrative functions of the central pathways that support the complex sensations that we usually associate with gustation. On the basis of recent experimental data, we argue that these brain circuits make use of distributed ensemble codes that represent the sensory and post-ingestive properties of tastants.","Phantom pain refers to pain in a body part that has been amputated or deafferented. It has often been viewed as a type of mental disorder or has been assumed to stem from pathological alterations in the region of the amputation stump. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated that phantom pain might be a phenomenon of the CNS that is related to plastic changes at several levels of the neuraxis and especially the cortex. Here, we discuss the evidence for putative pathophysiological mechanisms with an emphasis on central, and in particular cortical, changes. We cite both animal and human studies and derive suggestions for innovative interventions aimed at alleviating phantom pain.","Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a cholesterol transport protein and an isoform-specific major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. The lipoprotein receptors that bind APOE have recently been recognized as pivotal components of the neuronal signalling machinery. The interaction between APOE receptors and one of their ligands, reelin, allows them to function directly as signal transduction receptors at the plasma membrane to control not only neuronal positioning during brain development, but also synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms through which APOE, cholesterol, reelin and APOE receptors control synaptic functions that are essential for cognition, learning, memory, behaviour and neuronal survival.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2007 Mar;8(3):239.,"The dramatic evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex of Homo sapiens underlies our unique higher cortical functions, and therefore bears on the ultimate issue of what makes us human. Recent insights into developmental events during early proliferative stages of cortical development indicate how neural stem and progenitor cells might interact to produce cortical expansion during development, and could shed light on evolutionary changes in cortical structure.","The central retina mediates high acuity vision, and its progressive dysfunction due to macular degeneration is the leading cause of visual disability among adults in industrialized societies. Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of macular degeneration and the implications of this new knowledge for treatment and prevention. The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in this field, including the development of new, non-invasive retinal imaging technologies, the development of animal models for macular disease, and the isolation of many of the genes responsible for both early- and late-onset macular diseases. These advances have set the stage for the development of effective mechanism-based therapies.","Genes are major contributors to many psychiatric diseases, but their mechanisms of action have long seemed elusive. The intermediate phenotype concept represents a strategy for characterizing the neural systems affected by risk gene variants to elucidate quantitative, mechanistic aspects of brain function implicated in psychiatric disease. Using imaging genetics as an example, we illustrate recent advances, challenges and implications of linking genes to structural and functional variation in brain systems related to cognition and emotion.","The year 2006 marks the 100th anniversary of the first Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for studies in the field of the Neurosciences jointly awarded to Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal for their key contributions to the study of the nervous system. This award represented the beginning of the modern era of neuroscience. Using the Golgi method, Cajal made fundamental, but often unappreciated, contributions to the study of the relationship between brain plasticity and mental processes. Here, I focus on some of these early experiments and how they continue to influence studies of brain plasticity.","Cancer pain significantly affects the diagnosis, quality of life and survival of patients with cancer. During the past decade, preclinical and clinical data has begun to provide insight into the mechanisms that drive and mask cancer pain and the mechanisms by which anti-neoplastic agents induce peripheral neuropathy. Developing a mechanism-based understanding and mechanism-based therapies to treat cancer-associated pain and sensory neuropathy, and incorporating these into mainstream cancer research and therapy, will be crucial to improving the quality of life and survival of patients with cancer.","During the past 5 years, gene expression studies in cell culture, animal models and in the brains of patients have shown that the perturbation of transcription frequently results in neuronal dysfunction in polyglutamine repeat diseases such as Huntington's disease. Histone deacetylases act as repressors of transcription through interactions with co-repressor complexes, which leads to chromatin remodelling. Aberrant interactions between polyglutamine proteins and regulators of transcription could be one mechanism by which transcriptional dysregulation occurs. Here, we discuss the potential therapeutic pathways through which histone deacetylase inhibitors might act to correct the aberrant transcription observed in Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine repeat diseases.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Nov;7(11):902.,"Various studies, mostly in the past 5 years, have demonstrated that, in addition to their well-described function in regulating electrical excitability, voltage-dependent ion channels participate in intracellular signalling pathways. Channels can directly activate enzymes linked to cellular signalling pathways, serve as cell adhesion molecules or components of the cytoskeleton, and their activity can alter the expression of specific genes. Here, I review these findings and discuss the extent to which the molecular mechanisms of such signalling are understood.","Images of the exquisitely formed apparatus of the nervous system have great potential to capture the imagination. However, the fascinating complexity and diversity of neuronal form has only rarely been celebrated in broader visual culture. We discuss how scientific and cultural practices at the time of the neuron's discovery generated a legacy of schematic and simplified popular neuronal imagery, which is only now being revised in the light of technological advances and a changing artistic climate.","Functional MRI (fMRI) has had a major impact in cognitive neuroscience. fMRI now has a small but growing role in clinical neuroimaging, with initial applications to neurosurgical planning. Current clinical research has emphasized novel concepts for clinicians, such as the role of plasticity in recovery and the maintenance of brain functions in a broad range of diseases. There is a wider potential for clinical fMRI in applications ranging from presymptomatic diagnosis, through drug development and individualization of therapies, to understanding functional brain disorders. Realization of this potential will require changes in the way clinical neuroimaging services are planned and delivered.","Neural tube closure takes place during early embryogenesis and requires interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Failure of neural tube closure is a common congenital malformation that results in morbidity and mortality. A major clinical achievement has been the use of periconceptional folic acid supplements, which prevents approximately 50-75% of cases of neural tube defects. However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of folic acid is far from clear. Biochemical, genetic and epidemiological observations have led to the development of the methylation hypothesis, which suggests that folic acid prevents neural tube defects by stimulating cellular methylation reactions. Exploring the methylation hypothesis could direct us towards additional strategies to prevent neural tube defects.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic disorder caused by motor neuron degeneration. Mutations in more than 50 human genes cause diverse types of motor neuron pathology. Moreover, defects in five Mendelian genes lead to motor neuron disease, with two mutations reproducing the ALS phenotype. Analyses of these genetic effects have generated new insights into the diverse molecular pathways involved in ALS pathogenesis. Here, we present an overview of the mechanisms for motor neuron death and of the role of non-neuronal cells in ALS.","Behavioural, cellular and molecular studies have revealed significant effects of enriched environments on rodents and other species, and provided new insights into mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity, including adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The demonstration that the onset and progression of Huntington's disease in transgenic mice is delayed by environmental enrichment has emphasized the importance of understanding both genetic and environmental factors in nervous system disorders, including those with Mendelian inheritance patterns. A range of rodent models of other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, fragile X and Down syndrome, as well as various forms of brain injury, have now been compared under enriched and standard housing conditions. Here, we review these findings on the environmental modulators of pathogenesis and gene-environment interactions in CNS disorders, and discuss their therapeutic implications.","GABA-containing interneurons are crucial to both the development and function of the cerebral cortex. Unlike cortical projection neurons, which have a relatively conserved set of characteristics, interneurons include multiple phenotypes that vary on morphological, physiological and neurochemical axes. This diversity, and the relatively late, context-dependent maturation of defining features, has challenged efforts to uncover the transcriptional control of cortical interneuron development. Here, we discuss recent data that are beginning to illuminate the origins and specification of distinct subgroups of cortical interneurons.","The hippocampal formation can encode relative spatial location, without reference to external cues, by the integration of linear and angular self-motion (path integration). Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.","In the human brain, distinct functions tend to be localized in the left or right hemispheres, with language ability usually localized predominantly in the left and spatial recognition in the right. Furthermore, humans are perhaps the only mammals who have preferential handedness, with more than 90% of the population more skillful at using the right hand, which is controlled by the left hemisphere. How is a distinct function consistently localized in one side of the human brain? Because of the convergence of molecular and neurological analysis, we are beginning to consider the puzzle of brain asymmetry and handedness at a molecular level.","There are now numerous preclinical reports of various experimental treatments promoting some functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Surprisingly, perhaps, the mechanisms that underlie recovery have rarely been definitively established. Here, we critically evaluate the evidence that regeneration of damaged pathways or compensatory collateral sprouting can promote recovery. We also discuss several more speculative mechanisms that might putatively explain or confound some of the reported outcomes of experimental interventions.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Nov;7(11):902.,"Damage to the adult CNS often leads to persistent deficits due to the inability of mature axons to regenerate after injury. Mounting evidence suggests that the glial environment of the adult CNS, which includes inhibitory molecules in CNS myelin as well as proteoglycans associated with astroglial scarring, might present a major hurdle for successful axon regeneration. Here, we evaluate the molecular basis of these inhibitory influences and their contributions to the limitation of long-distance axon repair and other types of structural plasticity. Greater insight into glial inhibition is crucial for developing therapies to promote functional recovery after neural injury.","The precise wiring of the adult mammalian CNS originates during a period of stunning growth, guidance and plasticity that occurs during and shortly after development. When injured in adults, this intricate system fails to regenerate. Even when the obstacles to regeneration are cleared, growing adult CNS fibres usually remain misdirected and fail to reform functional connections. Here, we attempt to fill an important niche related to the topics of nervous system development and regeneration. We specifically contrast the difficulties faced by growing fibres within the adult context to the precise circuit-forming capabilities of developing fibres. In addition to focusing on methods to stimulate growth in the adult, we also expand on approaches to recapitulate development itself.","Gene-environment interaction research in psychiatry is new, and is a natural ally of neuroscience. Mental disorders have known environmental causes, but there is heterogeneity in the response to each causal factor, which gene-environment findings attribute to genetic differences at the DNA sequence level. Such findings come from epidemiology, an ideal branch of science for showing that a gene-environment interactions exist in nature and affect a significant fraction of disease cases. The complementary discipline of epidemiology, experimental neuroscience, fuels gene-environment hypotheses and investigates underlying neural mechanisms. This article discusses opportunities and challenges in the collaboration between psychiatry, epidemiology and neuroscience in studying gene-environment interactions.","Long-term memory and its putative synaptic correlates the late phases of both long-term potentiation and long-term depression require enhanced protein synthesis. On the basis of recent data on translation-dependent synaptic plasticity and on the supralinear effect of activation of nearby synapses on action potential generation, we propose a model for the formation of long-term memory engrams at the single neuron level. In this model, which we call clustered plasticity, local translational enhancement, along with synaptic tagging and capture, facilitates the formation of long-term memory engrams through bidirectional synaptic weight changes among synapses within a dendritic branch.","Neurons in most animals live a very long time relative to the half-lives of all of the proteins that govern excitability and synaptic transmission. Consequently, homeostatic mechanisms are necessary to ensure stable neuronal and network function over an animal's lifetime. To understand how these homeostatic mechanisms might function, it is crucial to understand how tightly regulated synaptic and intrinsic properties must be for adequate network performance, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms allow for multiple solutions to the production of similar behaviour. Here, we use examples from theoretical and experimental studies of invertebrates and vertebrates to explore several issues relevant to understanding the precision of tuning of synaptic and intrinsic currents for the operation of functional neuronal circuits.","Voltage-gated ion channels have to be at the right place in the right number to endow individual neurons with their specific character. Their biophysical properties together with their spatial distribution define the signalling characteristics of a neuron. Improper channel localization could cause communication defects in a neuronal network. This review covers recent studies of mechanisms for targeting voltage-gated ion channels to axons and dendrites, including trafficking, retention and endocytosis pathways for the preferential localization of particular ion channels. We also discuss how the spatial localization of these channels might contribute to the electrical excitability of neurons, and consider the need for future work in this emerging field.","The neurobiology of itch, which is formally known as pruritus, and its interaction with pain have been illustrated by the complexity of specific mediators, itch-related neuronal pathways and the central processing of itch. Scratch-induced pain can abolish itch, and analgesic opioids can generate itch, which indicates an antagonistic interaction. However, recent data suggest that there is a broad overlap between pain- and itch-related peripheral mediators and/or receptors, and there are astonishingly similar mechanisms of neuronal sensitization in the PNS and the CNS. The antagonistic interaction between pain and itch is already exploited in pruritus therapy, and current research concentrates on the identification of common targets for future analgesic and antipruritic therapy.","Recent advances in human neuroimaging have shown that it is possible to accurately decode a person's conscious experience based only on non-invasive measurements of their brain activity. Such 'brain reading' has mostly been studied in the domain of visual perception, where it helps reveal the way in which individual experiences are encoded in the human brain. The same approach can also be extended to other types of mental state, such as covert attitudes and lie detection. Such applications raise important ethical issues concerning the privacy of personal thought.","Evidence has been accumulating that the primate cerebellum contributes not only to motor control, but also to higher 'cognitive' function. However, there is no consensus about how the cerebellum processes such information. The answer to this puzzle can be found in the nature of cerebellar connections to areas of the cerebral cortex (particularly the prefrontal cortex) and in the uniformity of its intrinsic cellular organization, which implies uniformity in information processing regardless of the area of origin in the cerebral cortex. With this in mind, the relatively well-developed models of how the cerebellum processes information from the motor cortex might be extended to explain how it could also process information from the prefrontal cortex.","Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs are often used to treat psychiatric symptoms frequently seen in dementia, but their use is controversial. We present a new meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, and discuss the more limited evidence for their potential benefits in other dementias. We recommend that these treatments be limited to the short-term treatment of psychiatric symptoms associated with serious distress or risk.","Intuitively, decisions should always improve with more time for the accumulation of evidence, yet psychophysical data show a limit of 200-300 ms for many perceptual tasks. Here, we consider mechanisms that favour such rapid information processing in vision and olfaction. We suggest that the brain limits some types of perceptual processing to short, discrete chunks (for example, eye fixations and sniffs) in order to facilitate the construction of global sensory images.","Many organisms, especially humans, are characterized by their capacity for intentional, goal-directed actions. However, similar behaviours often proceed automatically, as habitual responses to antecedent stimuli. How are goal-directed actions transformed into habitual responses? Recent work combining modern behavioural assays and neurobiological analysis of the basal ganglia has begun to yield insights into the neural basis of habit formation.","In vivo microscopy is an exciting tool for neurological research because it can reveal how single cells respond to damage of the nervous system. This helps us to understand how diseases unfold and how therapies work. Here, we review the optical imaging techniques used to visualize the different parts of the nervous system, and how they have provided fresh insights into the aetiology and therapeutics of neurological diseases. We focus our discussion on five areas of neuropathology (trauma, degeneration, ischaemia, inflammation and seizures) in which in vivo microscopy has had the greatest impact. We discuss the challenging issues in the field, and argue that the convergence of new optical and non-optical methods will be necessary to overcome these challenges.","Adaptation is one of physiology's fundamental tenets, operating not only at the level of species, as Darwin proposed, but also at the level of tissues, cells, molecules and, perhaps, genes. During recent years, stroke neurobiologists have advanced a considerable body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that, with experimental coaxing, the mammalian brain can adapt to injurious insults such as cerebral ischaemia to promote cell survival in the face of subsequent injury. Establishing this protective phenotype in response to stress depends on a coordinated response at the genomic, molecular, cellular and tissue levels. Here, I summarize our current understanding of how 'preconditioning' stimuli trigger a cerebroprotective state known as cerebral 'ischaemic tolerance'.","Activity-dependent release of ATP from synapses, axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors that modulate intracellular calcium and cyclic AMP. This enables glia to detect neural activity and communicate among other glial cells by releasing ATP through membrane channels and vesicles. Through purinergic signalling, impulse activity regulates glial proliferation, motility, survival, differentiation and myelination, and facilitates interactions between neurons, and vascular and immune system cells. Interactions among purinergic, growth factor and cytokine signalling regulate synaptic strength, development and responses to injury. We review the involvement of ATP and adenosine receptors in neuron-glia signalling, including the release and hydrolysis of ATP, how the receptors signal, the pharmacological tools used to study them, and their functional significance.","A rapidly burgeoning literature documents copious sex influences on brain anatomy, chemistry and function. This article highlights some of the more intriguing recent discoveries and their implications. Consideration of the effects of sex can help to explain seemingly contradictory findings. Research into sex influences is mandatory to fully understand a host of brain disorders with sex differences in their incidence and/or nature. The striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on brain function indicate that the still widespread assumption that sex influences are negligible cannot be justified, and probably retards progress in our field.","Recent evidence shows that transplantation of neural stem/precursor cells may protect the central nervous system from inflammatory damage through a 'bystander' mechanism that is alternative to cell replacement. This novel mechanism, which might improve the success of transplantation procedures, is exerted by undifferentiated neural stem cells, the functional characteristics of which are regulated by important stem cell regulators released by CNS-resident and blood-borne inflammatory cells. Here, we discuss this alternative bystander mechanism in the context of the atypical ectopic perivascular niche. We propose that it is the most challenging example of reciprocal therapeutic crosstalk between the inflamed CNS and systemically transplanted neural stem cells.","Williams syndrome, a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of about 28 genes on chromosome 7q11.23, has long intrigued neuroscientists with its unique combination of striking behavioural abnormalities, such as hypersociability, and characteristic neurocognitive profile. Williams syndrome, therefore, raises fundamental questions about the neural mechanisms of social behaviour, the modularity of mind and brain development, and provides a privileged setting to understand genetic influences on complex brain functions in a 'bottom-up' way. We review recent advances in uncovering the functional and structural neural substrates of Williams syndrome that provide an emerging understanding of how these are related to dissociable genetic contributions characterized both in special participant populations and animal models.","Attention is a central theme in cognitive science - it exemplifies the links between the brain and behaviour, and binds psychology to the techniques of neuroscience. A visionary model suggested by Michael Posner described attention as a set of independent control networks. This challenged the previously held view of attention as a uniform concept. The idea that disparate attentional networks correlate with discrete neural circuitry and can be influenced by focal brain injuries, mental state and specific drugs has since been supported by converging data from several modern methodologies. Given the recent explosion in empirical data, attentional typologies provide powerful conceptual tools with which to contextualize and integrate these findings.","How the brain encodes information in population activity, and how it combines and manipulates that activity as it carries out computations, are questions that lie at the heart of systems neuroscience. During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.","The process through which young male songbirds learn the characteristics of the songs of an adult male of their own species has strong similarities with speech acquisition in human infants. Both involve two phases: a period of auditory memorization followed by a period during which the individual develops its own vocalizations. The avian 'song system', a network of brain nuclei, is the probable neural substrate for the second phase of sensorimotor learning. By contrast, the neural representation of song memory acquired in the first phase is localized outside the song system, in different regions of the avian equivalent of the human auditory association cortex.","Hypertension - the chronic elevation of blood pressure - is a major human health problem. In most cases, the root cause of the disease remains unknown, but there is mounting evidence that many forms of hypertension are initiated and maintained by an elevated sympathetic tone. This review examines how the sympathetic tone to cardiovascular organs is generated, and discusses how elevated sympathetic tone can contribute to hypertension.","Cognitive neuroscience is making rapid strides in areas highly relevant to education. However, there is a gulf between current science and direct classroom applications. Most scientists would argue that filling the gulf is premature. Nevertheless, at present, teachers are at the receiving end of numerous 'brain-based learning' packages. Some of these contain alarming amounts of misinformation, yet such packages are being used in many schools. What, if anything, can neuroscientists do to help good neuroscience into education?","Despite the explosive growth of bioinformatics, data sharing has not yet become routine in neuroscience, possibly because of several broad-spanning issues, from data heterogeneity to privacy regulations. We present the case of neuronal morphology as an ideal example of shareable data. Drawing from recent experience, we argue that the tremendous research potential of existing (and largely unused) digital reconstructions should diffuse any reticence to sharing this type of data.","Neuroscience is increasingly identifying associations between biology and violence that appear to offer courts evidence relevant to criminal responsibility. In addition, in a policy era of 'zero tolerance of risk', evidence of biological abnormality in some of those who are violent, or biological markers of violence, may be seized on as a possible basis for preventive detention in the interest of public safety. However, there is a mismatch between questions that the courts and society wish answered and those that neuroscience is capable of answering. This poses a risk to the proper exercise of justice and to civil liberties.","Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were among the first antidepressants to be discovered and have long been used as such. It now seems that many of these agents might have therapeutic value in several common neurodegenerative conditions, independently of their inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity. However, many claims and some counter-claims have been made about the physiological importance of these enzymes and the potential of their inhibitors. We evaluate these arguments in the light of what we know, and still have to learn, of the structure, function and genetics of the monoamine oxidases and the disparate actions of their inhibitors.","Everyone ages, but only some will develop a neurodegenerative disorder in the process. Disease might occur when cells fail to respond adaptively to age-related increases in oxidative, metabolic and ionic stress, thereby resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins, DNA and membranes. Determinants of neuronal vulnerability might include cell size and location, metabolism of disease-specific proteins and a repertoire of signal transduction pathways and stress resistance mechanisms. Emerging evidence on protein interaction networks that monitor and respond to the normal ageing process suggests that successful neural ageing is possible for most people, but also cautions that cures for neurodegenerative disorders are unlikely in the near future.","Social interaction is a cornerstone of human life, yet the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition are poorly understood. Recently, research that integrates approaches from neuroscience and social psychology has begun to shed light on these processes, and converging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests a unique role for the medial frontal cortex. We review the emerging literature that relates social cognition to the medial frontal cortex and, on the basis of anatomical and functional characteristics of this brain region, propose a theoretical model of medial frontal cortical function relevant to different aspects of social cognitive processing.","Lamination of neurons and fibre projections is a fundamental organizational principle of the mammalian cerebral cortex. A laminated organization is likely to be essential for cortical function, as studies in mutant mice have revealed causal relationships between lamination defects and functional deficits. Unveiling the determinants of the laminated cortical architecture will contribute to our understanding of how cortical functions have evolved in phylogenetic and ontogenetic development. Recently, the hippocampus, with its clearly segregated cell and fibre layers, has become a major subject of studies on cortical lamination.","People's faces show fear in many different circumstances. However, when people are terrified, as well as showing emotion, they run for cover. When we see a bodily expression of emotion, we immediately know what specific action is associated with a particular emotion, leaving little need for interpretation of the signal, as is the case for facial expressions. Research on emotional body language is rapidly emerging as a new field in cognitive and affective neuroscience. This article reviews how whole-body signals are automatically perceived and understood, and their role in emotional communication and decision-making.",Recent experiments in vivo and in vitro have advanced our understanding of the sites and mechanisms involved in mammalian respiratory rhythm generation. Here we evaluate and interpret the new evidence for two separate brainstem respiratory oscillators and for the essential role of emergent network properties in rhythm generation. Lesion studies suggest that respiratory cell death might explain morbidity and mortality associated with neurodegenerative disorders and ageing.,"Filling-in is a perceptual phenomenon in which a visual attribute such as colour, brightness, texture or motion is perceived in a region of the visual field even though such an attribute exists only in the surround. Filling-in dramatically reveals the dissociation between the retinal input and the percept, and raises fundamental questions about how these two relate to each other. Filling-in is observed in various situations, and is an essential part of our normal surface perception. Here, I review recent experiments examining brain activities associated with filling-in, and discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying this remarkable perceptual phenomenon. The evidence shows that neuronal activities in early visual cortical areas are involved in filling-in, providing new insights into visual cortical functions.","The quest to disentangle the aetiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been heavily influenced by the genes associated with the disease. The alpha-synuclein-centric theory of protein aggregation with the adjunct of parkin-driven proteasome deregulation has, in recent years, been complemented by the discovery and increasing knowledge of the functions of DJ1, PINK1 and OMI/HTRA2, which are all associated with the mitochondria and have been implicated in cellular protection against oxidative damage. We critically review how these genes fit into and enhance our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, and consider how oxidative stress might be a potential unifying factor in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease.","Recent work on glial cell physiology has revealed that glial cells, and astrocytes in particular, are much more actively involved in brain information processing than previously thought. This finding has stimulated the view that the active brain should no longer be regarded solely as a network of neuronal contacts, but instead as a circuit of integrated, interactive neurons and glial cells. Consequently, glial cells could also have as yet unexpected roles in the diseased brain. An improved understanding of astrocyte biology and heterogeneity and the involvement of these cells in pathogenesis offers the potential for developing novel strategies to treat neurological disorders.","The adult brain is a plastic place. To ensure that the mature nervous system's control of behaviour is flexible in the face of a varying environment, morphological and physiological changes are possible at many levels, including that of the entire cell. In two areas of the adult brain - the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus - new neurons are generated throughout life and form an integral part of the normal functional circuitry. This process is not fixed, but highly modulated, revealing a plastic mechanism by which the brain's performance can be optimized for a given environment. The functional benefits of this whole-cell plasticity, however, remain a matter for debate.","Behavioural and neurophysiological evidence convincingly establish that the left hemisphere is dominant for motor skills that are carried out with either hand or those that require bimanual coordination. As well as this prioritization, we argue that specialized functions of the right hemisphere are also indispensable for the realization of goal-directed behaviour. As such, lateralization of motor function is a dynamic and multifaceted process that emerges across different timescales and is contingent on task- and performer-related determinants.",IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer allows a quantum leap in the level of detail at which the brain can be modelled. I argue that the time is right to begin assimilating the wealth of data that has been accumulated over the past century and start building biologically accurate models of the brain from first principles to aid our understanding of brain function and dysfunction.,"All available antidepressant medications are based on serendipitous discoveries of the clinical efficacy of two classes of antidepressants more than 50 years ago. These tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants were subsequently found to promote serotonin or noradrenaline function in the brain. Newer agents are more specific but have the same core mechanisms of action in promoting these monoamine neurotransmitters. This is unfortunate, because only approximately 50% of individuals with depression show full remission in response to these mechanisms. This review summarizes the obstacles that have hindered the development of non-monoamine-based antidepressants, and provides a progress report on some of the most promising current strategies.","Neuropeptides that are released from dendrites, such as oxytocin and vasopressin, function as autocrine or paracrine signals at their site of origin, but can also act at distant brain targets to evoke long-lasting changes in behaviour. Oxytocin, for instance, has profound effects on social bonding that are exerted at sites that richly express oxytocin receptors, but which are innervated by few, if any, oxytocin-containing projections. How can a prolonged, diffuse signal have coherent behavioural consequences? The recently demonstrated ability of neuropeptides to prime vesicle stores for activity-dependent release could lead to a temporary functional reorganization of neuronal networks harbouring specific peptide receptors, providing a substrate for long-lasting effects.","Ca(2+) signals have profound and varied effects on growth cone motility and guidance. Modulation of Ca(2+) influx and release from stores by guidance cues shapes Ca(2+) signals, which determine the activation of downstream targets. Although the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie distinct Ca(2+)-mediated effects on growth cone behaviours remain unclear, recent studies have identified important players in both the regulation and targets of Ca(2+) signals in growth cones.","Dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube has a crucial role in shaping the functional organization of the CNS. It is well established that hedgehog signalling plays a key role in specifying ventral cell types throughout the neuroectoderm, and major progress has been made in elucidating how hedgehog signalling works in this ventral specification. In addition, other molecular pathways, including nodal, retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor signalling, have been identified as important molecular cues for ventral patterning of the spinal cord, telencephalon and eye. Here, we discuss recent advances in this field, highlighting the emerging interplay of these signalling pathways in the molecular specification of ventral patterning at different rostrocaudal levels of the CNS.","Signals through the Notch receptors are used throughout development to control cellular fate choices. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed both the pleiotropic action of the Notch signalling pathway in development and the potential of Notch signals as tools to influence the developmental path of undifferentiated cells. As we review here, Notch signalling affects the development of the nervous system at many different levels. Understanding the complex genetic circuitry that allows Notch signals to affect specific cell fates in a context-specific manner defines the next challenge, especially as such an understanding might have important implications for regenerative medicine.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Feb;7(2):167.,"Nanotechnologies exploit materials and devices with a functional organization that has been engineered at the nanometre scale. The application of nanotechnology in cell biology and physiology enables targeted interactions at a fundamental molecular level. In neuroscience, this entails specific interactions with neurons and glial cells. Examples of current research include technologies that are designed to better interact with neural cells, advanced molecular imaging technologies, materials and hybrid molecules used in neural regeneration, neuroprotection, and targeted delivery of drugs and small molecules across the blood-brain barrier.","Emotional events often attain a privileged status in memory. Cognitive neuroscientists have begun to elucidate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying emotional retention advantages in the human brain. The amygdala is a brain structure that directly mediates aspects of emotional learning and facilitates memory operations in other regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Emotion-memory interactions occur at various stages of information processing, from the initial encoding and consolidation of memory traces to their long-term retrieval. Recent advances are revealing new insights into the reactivation of latent emotional associations and the recollection of personal episodes from the remote past.","The blood-brain barrier, which is formed by the endothelial cells that line cerebral microvessels, has an important role in maintaining a precisely regulated microenvironment for reliable neuronal signalling. At present, there is great interest in the association of brain microvessels, astrocytes and neurons to form functional 'neurovascular units', and recent studies have highlighted the importance of brain endothelial cells in this modular organization. Here, we explore specific interactions between the brain endothelium, astrocytes and neurons that may regulate blood-brain barrier function. An understanding of how these interactions are disturbed in pathological conditions could lead to the development of new protective and restorative therapies.","The mechanisms involved in plasticity in the nervous system are thought to support cognition, and some of these processes are affected during normal ageing. Notably, cognitive functions that rely on the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, such as learning, memory and executive function, show considerable age-related decline. It is therefore not surprising that several neural mechanisms in these brain areas also seem to be particularly vulnerable during the ageing process. In this review, we discuss major advances in our understanding of age-related changes in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex and how these changes in functional plasticity contribute to behavioural impairments in the absence of significant pathology.","Cochlear hair cells respond with phenomenal speed and sensitivity to sound vibrations that cause submicron deflections of their hair bundle. Outer hair cells are not only detectors, but also generate force to augment auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Two mechanisms of force production have been proposed: contractions of the cell body or active motion of the hair bundle. Here, we describe recently identified proteins involved in the sensory and motor functions of auditory hair cells and present evidence for each force generator. Both motor mechanisms are probably needed to provide the high sensitivity and frequency discrimination of the mammalian cochlea.","Oligodendrocyte precursors first arise in a restricted ventral part of the embryonic spinal cord and migrate laterally and dorsally from there. Later, secondary sources develop in the dorsal cord. Normally, the ventrally-derived precursors compete with and suppress their dorsal counterparts. There are also ventral and dorsal sources in the forebrain, but here the more dorsal precursors prevail and the ventral-most lineage is eliminated during postnatal life. How do the different populations compete and what is the outcome of the competition? Do different embryonic origins signify different functional subgroups of oligodendrocyte?",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Jun;7(6):500.,"Self-motion disturbs the stability of retinal images by inducing optic flow. Objects of interest need to be fixated or tracked, yet these eye movements can infringe on the experienced retinal flow that is important for visual navigation. Separating the components of optic flow caused by an eye movement from those due to self-motion, as well as using optic flow for visual navigation while simultaneously maintaining visual acuity on near targets, represent key challenges for the visual system. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of how the visuomotor and vestibulomotor systems function and interact, given the complex task of compensating for instabilities of retinal images, which typically vary as a function of retinal location and differ for each eye.","Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling, particularly signalling from the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) members of this protein family, is crucial for the development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates. Experimental embryology and genetics performed in a range of organisms are providing insights into how BMPs establish the neural tissue and control the types and numbers of neurons formed. These studies also highlight the interactions between different developmental signals that are necessary to form a functional nervous system. The challenges ahead will be to uncover functions of TGFbeta signalling in later stages of CNS development, as well as to determine possible associations with neurological diseases.","The cerebral cortex is the largest and most intricately connected part of the mammalian brain. Its size and complexity has increased during the course of evolution, allowing improvements in old functions and causing the emergence of new ones, such as language. This has expanded the behavioural and cognitive repertoire of different species and has determined their competitive success. To allow the relatively rapid emergence of large evolutionary changes in a structure of such importance and complexity, the mechanisms by which cortical circuitry develops must be flexible and yet robust against changes that could disrupt the normal functions of the networks.","Several neurological diseases are characterized by the altered activity of one or a few ubiquitously expressed cell proteins, but it is not known how these normal proteins turn into harmful executors of selective neuronal cell death. We selected huntingtin in Huntington's disease to explore this question because the dominant inheritance pattern of the disease seems to exclude the possibility that the wild-type protein has a role in the natural history of this condition. However, even in this extreme case, there is considerable evidence that normal huntingtin is important for neuronal function and that the activity of some of its downstream effectors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, is reduced in Huntington's disease.","The matrix metalloproteinases and related A disintegrin and metalloproteinase enzymes are implicated in various diseases of the nervous system. However, metalloproteinases are increasingly being recognized as having beneficial roles during nervous system development and following injury. This review discusses general principles that govern the expression of metalloproteinases in the nervous system and their detrimental outcomes. It then focuses on the roles of metalloproteinases and their mechanisms in regulating neurogenesis, myelin formation and axonal growth. It is clear that metalloproteinases are important determinants in enabling recovery from injury to the nervous system.","The concept of death has evolved as technology has progressed. This has forced medicine and society to redefine its ancient cardiorespiratory centred diagnosis to a neurocentric diagnosis of death. The apparent consensus about the definition of death has not yet appeased all controversy. Ethical, moral and religious concerns continue to surface and include a prevailing malaise about possible expansions of the definition of death to encompass the vegetative state or about the feared bias of formulating criteria so as to facilitate organ transplantation.","Neuronal circuits in the brain are shaped by experience during 'critical periods' in early postnatal life. In the primary visual cortex, this activity-dependent development is triggered by the functional maturation of local inhibitory connections and driven by a specific, late-developing subset of interneurons. Ultimately, the structural consolidation of competing sensory inputs is mediated by a proteolytic reorganization of the extracellular matrix that occurs only during the critical period. The reactivation of this process, and subsequent recovery of function in conditions such as amblyopia, can now be studied with realistic circuit models that might generalize across systems.","The dentate gyrus provides the main input to the hippocampus. Information reaches the CA3 region through mossy fibre synapses made by dentate granule cell axons. Synaptic plasticity at the mossy fibre-pyramidal cell synapse is unusual for several reasons, including low basal release probability, pronounced frequency facilitation and a lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor involvement in long-term potentiation. In the past few years, some of the mechanisms underlying the peculiar features of mossy fibre synapses have been elucidated. Here we describe recent work from several laboratories on the various forms of synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses. We conclude that these contacts have just begun to reveal their many secrets.","K(+) channels play a crucial role in regulating the excitability of neurons. Many K(+) channels are, in turn, regulated by neurotransmitters. One of the first neurotransmitter-regulated channels to be identified, some 25 years ago, was the M channel. This was categorized as such because its activity was inhibited through stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. M channels are now known to be composed of subunits of the Kv7 (KCNQ) K(+) channel family. However, until recently, the link between the receptors and the channels has remained elusive. Here, we summarize recent developments that have begun to clarify this link and discuss their implications for physiology and medicine.","Why is the characteristic timescale of neural information processing in the millisecond range, corresponding to a 'clock speed' of about 1 kHz, whereas the clock speed of modern computers is about 3 GHz? Here we investigate how the brain's energy supply limits the maximum rate at which the brain can compute, and how the molecular components of excitatory synapses have evolved properties that are matched to the information processing they perform.","Mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is classically associated with non-shivering thermogenesis by brown fat. Recent evidence indicates that UCP family proteins are also present in selected neurons. Unlike UCP1, these proteins (UCP2, UCP4 and BMCP1/UCP5) are not constitutive uncouplers and are not crucial for non-shivering thermogenesis. However, they can be activated by free radicals and free fatty acids, and their activity has a profound influence on neuronal function. By regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, calcium flux, free radical production and local temperature, neuronal UCPs can directly influence neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative processes. Insights into the regulation and function of these proteins offer unsuspected avenues for a better understanding of synaptic transmission and neurodegeneration.","A wide range of insults can trigger axon degeneration, and axons respond with diverse morphology, topology and speed. However, recent genetic, immunochemical, morphological and pharmacological investigations point to convergent degeneration mechanisms. The principal convergence points - poor axonal transport, mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in intra-axonal calcium - have been identified by rescuing axons with the slow Wallerian degeneration gene (Wld(S)) and studies with blockers of sodium or calcium influx. By understanding how the pathways fit together, we can combine our knowledge of mechanisms, and potentially also treatment strategies, from different axonal disorders.","Characterizing the functional phenotypes of neurons is essential for understanding how genotypes can be related to the neural basis of behaviour. Traditional classifications of neurons by single features (such as morphology or firing behaviour) are increasingly inadequate for reflecting functional phenotypes, as they do not integrate functions across different neuronal types. Here, we describe a set of rules for identifying and predicting functional phenotypes that combine morphology, intrinsic ion channel species and their distributions in dendrites, and functional properties. This more comprehensive neuronal classification should be an improvement on traditional classifications for relating genotype to functional phenotype.","Moral cognitive neuroscience is an emerging field of research that focuses on the neural basis of uniquely human forms of social cognition and behaviour. Recent functional imaging and clinical evidence indicates that a remarkably consistent network of brain regions is involved in moral cognition. These findings are fostering new interpretations of social behavioural impairments in patients with brain dysfunction, and require new approaches to enable us to understand the complex links between individuals and society. Here, we propose a cognitive neuroscience view of how cultural and context-dependent knowledge, semantic social knowledge and motivational states can be integrated to explain complex aspects of human moral cognition.","In recent years there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the circuitry of the basal ganglia and our ability to predict the behavioural effects of specific cellular changes in this circuit on voluntary movement. These advances, combined with a new understanding of the rich distribution and diverse physiological roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the basal ganglia, indicate that these receptors might have a key role in motor control and raise the exciting possibility that they might provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders.","Recent functional imaging, neuropsychological and electrophysiological studies on adults have provided evidence for a fast, low-spatial-frequency, subcortical face-detection pathway that modulates the responses of certain cortical areas to faces and other social stimuli. These findings shed light on an older literature on the face-detection abilities of newborn infants, and the hypothesis that these newborn looking preferences are generated by a subcortical route. Converging lines of evidence indicate that the subcortical face route provides a developmental foundation for what later becomes the adult cortical 'social brain' network, and that disturbances to this pathway might contribute to certain developmental disorders.","Time is a fundamental dimension of life. It is crucial for decisions about quantity, speed of movement and rate of return, as well as for motor control in walking, speech, playing or appreciating music, and participating in sports. Traditionally, the way in which time is perceived, represented and estimated has been explained using a pacemaker-accumulator model that is not only straightforward, but also surprisingly powerful in explaining behavioural and biological data. However, recent advances have challenged this traditional view. It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and tells the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural populations.","Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute CNS injury. It has recently become clear that CNS injury significantly increases susceptibility to infection by brain-specific mechanisms: CNS injury induces a disturbance of the normally well balanced interplay between the immune system and the CNS. As a result, CNS injury leads to secondary immunodeficiency - CNS injury-induced immunodepression (CIDS) - and infection. CIDS might serve as a model for the study of the mechanisms and mediators of brain control over immunity. More importantly, understanding CIDS will allow us to work on developing effective therapeutic strategies, with which the outcome after CNS damage by a host of diseases could be improved by eliminating a major determinant of poor recovery.","New mRNA must be transcribed in order to consolidate changes in synaptic strength. But how are events at the synapse communicated to the nucleus? Some research has shown that proteins can move from activated synapses to the nucleus. However, other work has shown that action potentials can directly inform the nucleus about cellular activation. Here we contend that action potential-induced signalling to the nucleus best meets the requirements of the consolidation of synapse-specific plasticity, which include both timing and stoichiometric constraints.","Hedonic experience is arguably at the heart of what makes us human. In recent neuroimaging studies of the cortical networks that mediate hedonic experience in the human brain, the orbitofrontal cortex has emerged as the strongest candidate for linking food and other types of reward to hedonic experience. The orbitofrontal cortex is among the least understood regions of the human brain, but has been proposed to be involved in sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decision making and expectation. Here, the functional neuroanatomy of the human orbitofrontal cortex is described and a new integrated model of its functions proposed, including a possible role in the mediation of hedonic experience.","The evolution of complex nervous systems in vertebrates has been accompanied by, and probably dependent on, the acquisition of the myelin sheath. Although there has been substantial progress in our understanding of the factors that determine glial cell fate, much less is known about the cellular mechanisms that determine how the myelin sheath is extended and stabilized around axons. This review highlights four crucial stages of myelination, namely, the selection of axons and initiation of cell-cell interactions between them and glial cells, the establishment of stable intercellular contact and assembly of the nodes of Ranvier, regulation of myelin thickness and, finally, longitudinal extension of myelin segments in response to the lengthening of axons during postnatal growth.","During the development of peripheral nerves, neural crest cells generate myelinating and non-myelinating glial cells in a process that parallels gliogenesis from the germinal layers of the CNS. Unlike central gliogenesis, neural crest development involves a protracted embryonic phase devoted to the generation of, first, the Schwann cell precursor and then the immature Schwann cell, a cell whose fate as a myelinating or non-myelinating cell has yet to be determined. Embryonic nerves therefore offer a particular opportunity to analyse the early steps of gliogenesis from transient multipotent stem cells, and to understand how this process is integrated with organogenesis of peripheral nerves.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2005 Oct;6(10):818.,"Diverse animals can detect magnetic fields but little is known about how they do so. Three main hypotheses of magnetic field perception have been proposed. Electrosensitive marine fish might detect the Earth's field through electromagnetic induction, but direct evidence that induction underlies magnetoreception in such fish has not been obtained. Studies in other animals have provided evidence that is consistent with two other mechanisms: biogenic magnetite and chemical reactions that are modulated by weak magnetic fields. Despite recent advances, however, magnetoreceptors have not been identified with certainty in any animal, and the mode of transduction for the magnetic sense remains unknown.","Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of undegradable molecules in cells or at extracellular sites in the brain. One such family of diseases is the lysosomal storage disorders, which result from defects in various aspects of lysosomal function. Until recently, there was little prospect of treating storage diseases involving the CNS. However, recent progress has been made in understanding these conditions and in translating the findings into experimental therapies. We review the developments in this field and discuss the similarities in pathological features between these diseases and some more common neurodegenerative disorders.","Forty-five years ago, Roger Sperry, Joseph Bogen and I embarked on what are now known as the modern split-brain studies. These experiments opened up new frontiers in brain research and gave rise to much of what we know about hemispheric specialization and integration. The latest developments in split-brain research build on the groundwork laid by those early studies. Split-brain methodology, on its own and in conjunction with neuroimaging, has yielded insights into the remarkable regional specificity of the corpus callosum as well as into the integrative role of the callosum in the perception of causality and in our perception of an integrated sense of self.","Faces convey a wealth of social signals. A dominant view in face-perception research has been that the recognition of facial identity and facial expression involves separable visual pathways at the functional and neural levels, and data from experimental, neuropsychological, functional imaging and cell-recording studies are commonly interpreted within this framework. However, the existing evidence supports this model less strongly than is often assumed. Alongside this two-pathway framework, other possible models of facial identity and expression recognition, including one that has emerged from principal component analysis techniques, should be considered.","Neuronal connections are established and refined through a series of developmental programs that involve axon and dendrite specification, process growth, target innervation, cell death and synaptogenesis. Many of these developmental events are regulated by target-derived neurotrophins and their receptors, which signal retrogradely over long distances from distal-most axons to neuronal cell bodies. Recent work has established many of the cellular and molecular events that underlie retrograde signalling and the importance of these events for both development and maintenance of proper neural connectivity.","Neurotrophins have diverse functions in the CNS. Initially synthesized as precursors (proneurotrophins), they are cleaved to produce mature proteins, which promote neuronal survival and enhance synaptic plasticity by activating Trk receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent studies indicate that proneurotrophins serve as signalling molecules by interacting with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Interestingly, proneurotrophins often have biological effects that oppose those of mature neurotrophins. Therefore, the proteolytic cleavage of proneurotrophins represents a mechanism that controls the direction of action of neurotrophins. New insights into the 'yin and yang' of neurotrophin activity have profound implications for our understanding of the role of neurotrophins in a wide range of cellular processes.","For decades, astrocytes have been considered to be non-excitable support cells of the brain. However, this view has changed radically during the past twenty years. The recent recognition that they are organized in separate territories and possess active properties--notably a competence for the regulated release of 'gliotransmitters', including glutamate--has enabled us to develop an understanding of previously unknown functions for astrocytes. Today, astrocytes are seen as local communication elements of the brain that can generate various regulatory signals and bridge structures (from neuronal to vascular) and networks that are otherwise disconnected from each other. Examples of their specific and essential roles in normal physiological processes have begun to accumulate, and the number of diseases known to involve defective astrocytes is increasing.","Resistance to drug treatment is an important hurdle in the therapy of many brain disorders, including brain cancer, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression and infection of the brain with HIV. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new and more effective treatment strategies. Mechanisms of resistance that operate in cancer and infectious diseases might also be relevant in drug-resistant brain disorders. In particular, drug efflux transporters that are expressed at the blood-brain barrier limit the ability of many drugs to access the brain. There is increasing evidence that drug efflux transporters have an important role in drug-resistant brain disorders, and this information should allow more efficacious treatment strategies to be developed.","Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of the placebo effect, and most of our knowledge originates from the field of pain and analgesia. Today, the placebo effect represents a promising model that could allow us to shed new light on mind-body interactions. The mental events induced by placebo administration can activate mechanisms that are similar to those activated by drugs, which indicates a similarity between psychosocial and pharmacodynamic effects. These new neurobiological advances are already changing our conception of how clinical trials and medical practice must be viewed and conducted.","Acute pain and emotion are processed in two forebrain networks, and the cingulate cortex is involved in both. Although Brodmann's cingulate gyrus had two divisions and was not based on any functional criteria, functional imaging studies still use this model. However, recent cytoarchitectural studies of the cingulate gyrus support a four-region model, with subregions, that is based on connections and qualitatively unique functions. Although the activity evoked by pain and emotion has been widely reported, some view them as emergent products of the brain rather than of small aggregates of neurons. Here, we assess pain and emotion in each cingulate subregion, and assess whether pain is co-localized with negative affect. Amazingly, these activation patterns do not simply overlap.","During the past two decades, an important focus of pain research has been the study of chronic pain mechanisms, particularly the processes that lead to the abnormal sensitivity - spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia - that is associated with these states. For some time it has been recognized that inflammatory mediators released from immune cells can contribute to these persistent pain states. However, it has only recently become clear that immune cell products might have a crucial role not just in inflammatory pain, but also in neuropathic pain caused by damage to peripheral nerves or to the CNS.","The study of pain development has come into its own. Reaping the rewards of years of developmental and molecular biology, it has now become possible to translate fundamental knowledge of signalling pathways and synaptic physiology into a better understanding of infant pain. Research has cast new light on the physiological and pharmacological processes that shape the newborn pain response, which will help us to understand early pain behaviour and to design better treatments. Furthermore, it has shown how developing pain circuitry depends on non-noxious sensory activity in the healthy newborn, and how early injury can permanently alter pain processing.","Fifteen years ago, cell lineage restriction boundaries were discovered in the embryonic vertebrate hindbrain, subdividing it into a series of cell-tight compartments (known as rhombomeres). Compartition, together with segmentally reiterative neuronal architecture and the nested expression of Hox genes, indicates that the hindbrain has a truly metameric organization. This finding initiated a search for compartments in other regions of the developing brain. The results of recent studies have clarified where compartment boundaries exist, have shed light on molecular mechanisms that underlie their formation and have revealed an important function of these boundaries: the positioning and stabilization of local signalling centres.","GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors mediate most of the 'fast' synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain and are targeted by many clinically important drugs. Certain naturally occurring pregnane steroids can potently and specifically enhance GABA(A) receptor function in a nongenomic (direct) manner, and consequently have anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and anaesthetic properties. These steroids not only act as remote endocrine messengers, but also can be synthesized in the brain, where they modify neuronal activity locally by modulating GABA(A) receptor function. Such 'neurosteroids' can influence mood and behaviour in various physiological and pathophysiological situations, and might contribute to the behavioural effects of psychoactive drugs.","For a long time the cortical systems for language and actions were believed to be independent modules. However, as these systems are reciprocally connected with each other, information about language and actions might interact in distributed neuronal assemblies. A critical case is that of action words that are semantically related to different parts of the body (for example, 'lick', 'pick' and 'kick'): does the comprehension of these words specifically, rapidly and automatically activate the motor system in a somatotopic manner, and does their comprehension rely on activity in the action system?","Erythropoietin mediates an evolutionarily conserved, ancient immune response that limits damage to the heart, the nervous system and other tissues following injury. New evidence indicates that erythropoietin specifically prevents the destruction of viable tissue surrounding the site of an injury by signalling through a non-haematopoietic receptor. Engineered derivatives of erythropoietin that have a high affinity for this receptor have been developed, and these show robust tissue-protective effects in diverse preclinical models without stimulating erythropoiesis. A recent successful proof-of-concept clinical trial that used erythropoietin to treat human patients who had suffered a stroke encourages the evaluation of both this cytokine and non-erythropoietic derivatives as therapeutic agents to limit tissue injury.","Vertebrate spinal cord and brainstem central pattern generator (CPG) circuits share profound similarities with neocortical circuits. CPGs can produce meaningful functional output in the absence of sensory inputs. Neocortical circuits could be considered analogous to CPGs as they have rich spontaneous dynamics that, similar to CPGs, are powerfully modulated or engaged by sensory inputs, but can also generate output in their absence. We find compelling evidence for this argument at the anatomical, biophysical, developmental, dynamic and pathological levels of analysis. Although it is possible that cortical circuits are particularly plastic types of CPG ('learning CPGs'), we argue that present knowledge about CPGs is likely to foretell the basic principles of the organization and dynamic function of cortical circuits.","Since the time of Pythagoras, numerical and spatial representations have been inextricably linked. We suggest that the relationship between the two is deeply rooted in the brain's organization for these capacities. Many behavioural and patient studies have shown that numerical-spatial interactions run far deeper than simply cultural constructions, and, instead, influence behaviour at several levels. By combining two previously independent lines of research, neuroimaging studies of numerical cognition in humans, and physiological studies of spatial cognition in monkeys, we propose that these numerical-spatial interactions arise from common parietal circuits for attention to external space and internal representations of numbers.","Short-term and long-term changes in the strength of synapses in neural networks underlie working memory and long-term memory storage in the brain. These changes are regulated by many biochemical signalling pathways in the postsynaptic spines of excitatory synapses. Recent findings about the roles and regulation of the small GTPases Ras, Rap and Rac in spines provide new insights into the coordination and cooperation of different pathways to effect synaptic plasticity. Here, we present an initial working representation of the interactions of five signalling cascades that are usually studied individually. We discuss their integrated function in the regulation of postsynaptic plasticity.","The use of zinc in medicinal skin cream was mentioned in Egyptian papyri from 2000 BC (for example, the Smith Papyrus), and zinc has apparently been used fairly steadily throughout Roman and modern times (for example, as the American lotion named for its zinc ore, 'Calamine'). It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that zinc is a relatively late addition to the pantheon of signal ions in biology and medicine. However, the number of biological functions, health implications and pharmacological targets that are emerging for zinc indicate that it might turn out to be 'the calcium of the twenty-first century'.","In response to stress, the brain activates several neuropeptide-secreting systems. This eventually leads to the release of adrenal corticosteroid hormones, which subsequently feed back on the brain and bind to two types of nuclear receptor that act as transcriptional regulators. By targeting many genes, corticosteroids function in a binary fashion, and serve as a master switch in the control of neuronal and network responses that underlie behavioural adaptation. In genetically predisposed individuals, an imbalance in this binary control mechanism can introduce a bias towards stress-related brain disease after adverse experiences. New candidate susceptibility genes that serve as markers for the prediction of vulnerable phenotypes are now being identified.","There is a stark contrast between our attitudes to sleep and those of the pre-industrial age. In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar we are told to ""Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber"". There seems little chance of this today, as we crave more, work more and expect more, and, in the process, abandon sleep. Our occupation of the night is having unanticipated costs for both our physical and mental health, which, if continued, might condemn whole sectors of our society to a dismal future.","Cortical neurons show irregular but structured spike trains. This has been interpreted as evidence for 'temporal coding', whereby stimuli are represented by precise spike-timing patterns. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the older concept of the cell assembly. The dynamic evolution of assembly sequences, which are steered but not deterministically controlled by sensory input, is the proposed substrate of psychological processes beyond simple stimulus-response associations. Accordingly, spike trains show a temporal structure that is stimulus-dependent and more variable than would be predicted by strict sensory control. We propose four signatures of assembly organization that can be experimentally tested. We argue that many observations that have been interpreted as evidence for temporal coding might instead reflect an underlying assembly structure.","Sensory, motor and cortical neurons fire impulses or spikes at a regular, but slowly declining, rate in response to a constant current stimulus. Yet, the intervals between spikes often vary randomly during behaviour. Is this variation an unavoidable effect of generating spikes by sensory or synaptic processes ('neural noise') or is it an important part of the 'signal' that is transmitted to other neurons? Here, we mainly discuss this question in relation to sensory and motor processes, as the signals are best identified in such systems, although we also touch on central processes.","The mental retardation protein FMRP is involved in the transport of mRNAs and their translation at synapses. Patients with fragile X syndrome, in whom FMRP is absent or mutated, show deficits in learning and memory that might reflect impairments in the translational regulation of a subset of neuronal mRNAs. The study of FMRP provides important insights into the regulation and functions of local protein synthesis in the neuronal periphery, and increases our understanding of how these functions can produce specific effects at individual synapses.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2005 Jul;6(7):582.,"To make adaptive decisions, animals must evaluate the costs and benefits of available options. The nascent field of neuroeconomics has set itself the ambitious goal of understanding the brain mechanisms that are responsible for these evaluative processes. A series of recent neurophysiological studies in monkeys has begun to address this challenge using novel methods to manipulate and measure an animal's internal valuation of competing alternatives. By emphasizing the behavioural mechanisms and neural signals that mediate decision making under conditions of uncertainty, these studies might lay the foundation for an emerging neurobiology of choice behaviour.","Immersive virtual environments can break the deep, everyday connection between where our senses tell us we are and where we are actually located and whom we are with. The concept of 'presence' refers to the phenomenon of behaving and feeling as if we are in the virtual world created by computer displays. In this article, we argue that presence is worthy of study by neuroscientists, and that it might aid the study of perception and consciousness.","'Statins' are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors - oral cholesterol-lowering drugs that are used to treat hypercholesterolaemia. It is widely accepted that statins have anti-inflammatory effects that are independent of their ability to lower cholesterol. Animal studies and observational clinical studies have indicated that statins might also be effective in treating certain neurological diseases - in particular, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and ischaemic stroke. At present, however, results from ongoing prospective, randomized clinical trials are not available.","Impairments in certain cognitive functions, such as working memory, are core features of schizophrenia. Convergent findings indicate that a deficiency in signalling through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor leads to reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesis in the parvalbumin-containing subpopulation of inhibitory GABA neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. Despite both pre- and postsynaptic compensatory responses, the resulting alteration in perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons contributes to a diminished capacity for the gamma-frequency synchronized neuronal activity that is required for working memory function. These findings reveal specific targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia.","A coordinated movement is easy to recognize, but we know little about how it is achieved. In search of the neural basis of coordination, we present a model of spinocerebellar interactions in which the structure-functional organizing principle is a division of the cerebellum into discrete microcomplexes. Each microcomplex is the recipient of a specific motor error signal - that is, a signal that conveys information about an inappropriate movement. These signals are encoded by spinal reflex circuits and conveyed to the cerebellar cortex through climbing fibre afferents. This organization reveals salient features of cerebellar information processing, but also highlights the importance of systems level analysis for a fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie behaviour.","The huge number of neurons in the human brain are connected to form functionally specialized assemblies. The brain's amazing processing capabilities rest on local communication within and long-range communication between these assemblies. Even simple sensory, motor and cognitive tasks depend on the precise coordination of many brain areas. Recent improvements in the methods of studying long-range communication have allowed us to address several important questions. What are the common mechanisms that govern local and long-range communication and how do they relate to the structure of the brain? How does oscillatory synchronization subserve neural communication? And what are the consequences of abnormal synchronization?","A recent flurry of time-lapse imaging studies of live neurons have tried to address the century-old question: what morphological changes in dendritic spines can be related to long-term memory? Changes that have been proposed to relate to memory include the formation of new spines, the enlargement of spine heads and the pruning of spines. These observations also relate to a more general question of how stable dendritic spines are. The objective of this review is to critically assess the new data and to propose much needed criteria that relate spines to memory, thereby allowing progress in understanding the morphological basis of memory.","Excitatory synapses in the brain show several forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are initiated by increases in intracellular Ca(2+) that are generated through NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors or voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels. LTP depends on the coordinated regulation of an ensemble of enzymes, including Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, adenylyl cyclase 1 and 8, and calcineurin, all of which are stimulated by calmodulin, a Ca(2+)-binding protein. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that calmodulin is a central integrator of synaptic plasticity and that its unique regulatory properties allow the integration of several forms of signal transduction that are required for LTP and LTD.","The study of implicit perception - perception in the absence of awareness - has a long history. Decades of behavioural work have identified crucial theoretical and methodological issues that must be considered when evaluating claims of implicit perception. Neuroimaging methods provide an important new avenue for illuminating our understanding of perception both with and without awareness, but most imaging experiments have not met the rigorous conditions that the behavioural work has shown are necessary for inferring implicit perception. Here, we review the literature of both behavioural and neuroimaging studies, and note the pitfalls of studying implicit perception as well as the promise that neuroimaging studies have for providing insights about implicit perception when combined with appropriately rigorous behavioural measures of awareness.","The chemical hypothesis of depression suggests that mood disorders are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can be corrected by antidepressant drugs. However, recent evidence indicates that problems in information processing within neural networks, rather than changes in chemical balance, might underlie depression, and that antidepressant drugs induce plastic changes in neuronal connectivity, which gradually lead to improvements in neuronal information processing and recovery of mood.","One of the key organizers in the CNS is the floor plate - a group of cells that is responsible for instructing neural cells to acquire distinctive fates, and that has an important role in establishing the elaborate neuronal networks that underlie the function of the brain and spinal cord. In recent years, considerable controversy has arisen over the mechanism by which floor plate cells form. Here, we describe recent evidence that indicates that discrete populations of floor plate cells, with characteristic molecular properties, form in different regions of the neuraxis, and we discuss data that imply that the mode of floor plate induction varies along the anteroposterior axis.","The proper functioning of the adult mammalian brain relies on the orchestrated regulation of neural activity by a diverse population of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons. Until recently, our appreciation of GABA-mediated inhibition focused predominantly on the GABA(A) (GABA type A) receptors located at synaptic contacts, which are activated in a transient or 'phasic' manner by GABA that is released from synaptic vesicles. However, there is growing evidence that low concentrations of ambient GABA can persistently activate certain subtypes of GABA(A) receptor, which are often remote from synapses, to generate a 'tonic' conductance. In this review, we consider the distinct roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptor subtypes in the control of neuronal excitability.","Gap junctions are channel-forming structures in contacting plasma membranes that allow direct metabolic and electrical communication between almost all cell types in the mammalian brain. At least 20 connexin genes and 3 pannexin genes probably code for gap junction proteins in mice and humans. Gap junctions between murine neurons (also known as electrical synapses) can be composed of connexin 36, connexin 45 or connexin 57 proteins, depending on the type of neuron. Furthermore, pannexin 1 and 2 are likely to form electrical synapses. Here, we discuss the roles of connexin and pannexin genes in the formation of neuronal gap junctions, and evaluate recent functional analyses of electrical synapses that became possible through the characterization of mouse mutants that show targeted defects in connexin genes.","Intracellular transport is fundamental for neuronal morphogenesis, function and survival. Many proteins are selectively transported to either axons or dendrites. In addition, some specific mRNAs are transported to dendrites for local translation. Proteins of the kinesin superfamily participate in selective transport by using adaptor or scaffolding proteins to recognize and bind cargoes. The molecular components of RNA-transporting granules have been identified, and it is becoming clear how cargoes are directed to axons and dendrites by kinesin superfamily proteins. Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms of directional axonal and dendritic transport with specific emphasis on the role of motor proteins and their mechanisms of cargo recognition.","Numbers are an integral part of our everyday life - we use them to quantify, rank and identify objects. The verbal number concept allows humans to develop superior mathematical and logic skills that define technologically advanced cultures. However, basic numerical competence is rooted in biological primitives that can be explored in animals, infants and human adults alike. We are now beginning to unravel its anatomical basis and neuronal mechanisms on many levels, down to its single neuron correlate. Neural representations of numerical information can engage extensive cerebral networks, but the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex are the key structures in primates.","The wide dissemination and expanding applications of functional MRI have not escaped the attention of the media or discussion in the wider public arena. From the bench to the bedside, this technology has introduced substantial ethical challenges. Are the boundaries of what it can and cannot achieve being communicated to the public? Are its limitations understood? And given the complexities that are inherent to neuroscience, are current avenues for communication adequate?","We believe that names have a powerful influence on the experiments we do and the way in which we think. For this reason, and in the light of new evidence about the function and evolution of the vertebrate brain, an international consortium of neuroscientists has reconsidered the traditional, 100-year-old terminology that is used to describe the avian cerebrum. Our current understanding of the avian brain - in particular the neocortex-like cognitive functions of the avian pallium - requires a new terminology that better reflects these functions and the homologies between avian and mammalian brains.","Membrane vesicle cycling is orchestrated through the combined actions of proteins and lipids. At neuronal synapses, this orchestration must meet the stringent demands of speed, fidelity and sustainability of the synaptic vesicle cycle that mediates neurotransmission. Historically, the lion's share of the attention has been focused on the proteins that are involved in this cycle; but, in recent years, it has become clear that the previously unheralded plasma membrane and vesicle lipids are also key regulators of this cycle. This article reviews recent insights into the roles of lipid-modifying enzymes and lipids in the acute modulation of neurotransmission.","That speech and language are innate capacities of the human brain has long been widely accepted, but only recently has an entry point into the genetic basis of these remarkable faculties been found. The discovery of a mutation in FOXP2 in a family with a speech and language disorder has enabled neuroscientists to trace the neural expression of this gene during embryological development, track the effects of this gene mutation on brain structure and function, and so begin to decipher that part of our neural inheritance that culminates in articulate speech.","A fundamental question in memory research is how our brains can form enduring memories. In humans, memories of everyday life depend initially on the medial temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus. As these memories mature, they are thought to become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the cortex. Little is understood about how new memories in the hippocampus are transformed into remote memories in cortical networks. However, recent studies have begun to shed light on how remote memories are organized in the cortex, and the molecular and cellular events that underlie their consolidation.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2005 Mar;6(3):255.,"Discoveries concerning the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation and development have dictated the definition of a new sub-discipline of genetics known as epigenetics. Epigenetics refers to a set of self-perpetuating, post-translational modifications of DNA and nuclear proteins that produce lasting alterations in chromatin structure as a direct consequence, and lasting alterations in patterns of gene expression as an indirect consequence. The area of epigenetics is a burgeoning subfield of genetics in which there is considerable enthusiasm driving new discoveries. Neurobiologists have only recently begun to investigate the possible roles of epigenetic mechanisms in behaviour, physiology and neuropathology. Strikingly, the relevant data from the few extant neurobiology-related studies have already indicated a theme - epigenetic mechanisms probably have an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.","A key goal in functional neuroimaging is to use signals that are related to local changes in metabolism and blood flow to track the neuronal correlates of mental activity. Recent findings indicate that the dendritic processing of excitatory synaptic inputs correlates more closely than the generation of spikes with brain imaging signals. The correlation is often nonlinear and context-sensitive, and cannot be generalized for every condition or brain region. The vascular signals are mainly produced by increases in intracellular calcium in neurons and possibly astrocytes, which activate important enzymes that produce vasodilators to generate increments in flow and the positive blood oxygen level dependent signal. Our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of functional imaging signals places constraints on the interpretation of the data.","Significant progress has been made in the development of visual neuroprostheses to restore vision in blind individuals. Appropriate delivery of electrical stimulation to intact visual structures can evoke patterned sensations of light in those who have been blind for many years. However, success in developing functional visual prostheses requires an understanding of how to communicate effectively with the visually deprived brain in order to merge what is perceived visually with what is generated electrically.","Communication between cells reaches its highest degree of specialization at chemical synapses. Some synapses talk in a 'whisper'; others 'shout'. The 'louder' the synapse, the more synaptic vesicles are needed to maintain effective transmission, ranging from a few hundred (whisperers) to nearly a million (shouters). These vesicles reside in different 'pools', which have been given a bewildering array of names. In this review, we focus on five tissue preparations in which synaptic vesicle pools have been identified and thoroughly characterized. We argue that, in each preparation, each vesicle can be assigned to one of three distinct pools.","Cholinergic projections to the cortex and hippocampus mediate fundamental cognitive processes. The capacity of the high-affinity choline uptake transporter (CHT) to import choline from the extracellular space to presynaptic terminals is essential for normal acetylcholine synthesis and therefore cholinergic transmission. The CHT is highly regulated, and the cellular mechanisms that modulate its capacity show considerable plasticity. Recent evidence links changes in CHT capacity with the ability to perform tasks that tax attentional processes and capacities. Abnormal regulation of CHT capacity might contribute to the cognitive impairments that are associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the CHT might represent a productive target for the development of new pharmacological treatments for these conditions.","Although non-invasive methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalograms and magnetoencephalograms provide most of the current data about the human brain, their resolution is insufficient to show physiological processes at the cellular level. Clinical approaches sometimes allow invasive recordings to be taken from the human brain, mainly in patients with epilepsy or with movement disorders, and such recordings can sample neural activity at spatial scales ranging from single cells to distributed cell assemblies. In addition to their clinical relevance, these recordings can provide unique insights into brain functions such as movement control, perception, memory, language and even consciousness.","Prions--pathogens that are lethal to humans and other animals--are thought to be conformational isomers of the cellular prion protein. Their unique biology, and the potential for a wider pathobiological significance of prion-like mechanisms, has motivated much research into understanding prion neurodegeneration. Moreover, concerns that extensive dietary exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions might have infected many individuals--who might eventually develop its human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)--has focused much interest on therapeutics. The challenge of interrupting this aggressive, diffuse and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative process is daunting. However, the recent finding that the onset of clinical disease in established neuroinvasive prion infection in a mouse model can be halted and early pathology reversed is a source for considerable optimism. A therapeutic focus on the cellular prion protein, rather than prions themselves, which might not be directly neurotoxic, is suggested.","Many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by conformational changes in proteins that result in misfolding, aggregation and intra- or extra-neuronal accumulation of amyloid fibrils. Molecular chaperones provide a first line of defence against misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and are among the most potent suppressors of neurodegeneration known for animal models of human disease. Recent studies have investigated the role of molecular chaperones in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and polyglutamine diseases. We propose that molecular chaperones are neuroprotective because of their ability to modulate the earliest aberrant protein interactions that trigger pathogenic cascades. A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of chaperone-mediated protection against neurodegeneration might lead to the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with protein misfolding and aggregation.","Drug addiction manifests as a compulsive drive to take a drug despite serious adverse consequences. This aberrant behaviour has traditionally been viewed as bad ""choices"" that are made voluntarily by the addict. However, recent studies have shown that repeated drug use leads to long-lasting changes in the brain that undermine voluntary control. This, combined with new knowledge of how environmental, genetic and developmental factors contribute to addiction, should bring about changes in our approach to the prevention and treatment of addiction.","Long-term potentiation and long-term depression are processes that have been widely studied to understand the molecular basis of information storage in the brain. Glutamate receptors are required for the induction and expression of these forms of plasticity, and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors are involved in their modulation. Recent insights into how these receptors are rapidly moved into and out of synaptic membranes has profound implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of long-term potentiation and long-term depression.","Both behaviour and its neural control can be studied at two levels. At the proximate level, we aim to identify the neural circuits that control behaviour and to understand how information is represented and processed in these circuits. Ultimately, however, we are faced with questions of why particular neural solutions have arisen, and what factors govern the ways in which neural circuits are modified during the evolution of new behaviours. Only by integrating these levels of analysis can we fully understand the neural control of behaviour. Recent studies of electrosensory systems show how this synthesis can benefit from the use of tractable systems and comparative studies.","Changes in gene expression are required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Regulation of local protein synthesis allows synapses to control synaptic strength independently of messenger RNA synthesis in the cell body. Recent reports indicate that several biochemical signalling cascades couple neurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptors to translational regulatory factors in protein synthesis-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. In this review, we highlight these translational regulatory mechanisms and the signalling pathways that govern the expression of synaptic plasticity in response to specific types of neuronal stimulation.","Stress has profound effects on brain structure and function, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Recent studies imply that neuronal cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily--NCAM and L1--are important mediators of the effects of stress on the brain. Chronic stress regimes that lead to hippocampal atrophy and spatial-learning impairment in rodents simultaneously induce a pattern of changes in cell adhesion molecule expression that fits with a role for these molecules in stress-induced neuronal damage and neuroprotective mechanisms. These findings highlight cell adhesion molecules as potential therapeutic targets to treat stress-related cognitive disturbances.","Voltage-activated cation channels have pores that are selective for K(+), Na(+) or Ca(2+). Neurons use these channels to generate and propagate action potentials, release neurotransmitters at synaptic terminals and integrate incoming signals in dendrites. Recent X-ray and electron microscopy studies of an archaebacterial voltage-activated K(+) (Kv) channel have provided the first atomic resolution images of the voltage-sensing domains in Kv channels. Although these structures are consistent with previous biophysical analyses of eukaryotic channels, they also contain surprises, which have provoked new ideas about the structure and movements of these proteins during gating. This review summarizes our current understanding of these intriguing membrane proteins and highlights the open questions.","Objects are the building blocks of experience, but what do we mean by an object? Increasingly, neuroscientists refer to 'auditory objects', yet it is not clear what properties these should possess, how they might be represented in the brain, or how they might relate to the more familiar objects of vision. The concept of an auditory object challenges our understanding of object perception. Here, we offer a critical perspective on the concept and its basis in the brain.","During the last few decades, neuroscientists have benefited from the emergence of many powerful functional imaging techniques that cover broad spatial and temporal scales. We can now image single molecules controlling cell differentiation, growth and death; single cells and their neurites processing electrical inputs and sending outputs; neuronal circuits performing neural computations in vitro; and the intact brain. At present, imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) offers the highest spatial and temporal resolution for imaging neocortical functions in the living brain, and has paved the way for a new era in the functional imaging of cortical dynamics. It has facilitated the exploration of fundamental mechanisms that underlie neocortical development, function and plasticity at the fundamental level of the cortical column.","There is increasing evidence that iron is involved in the mechanisms that underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Conditions such as neuroferritinopathy and Friedreich ataxia are associated with mutations in genes that encode proteins that are involved in iron metabolism, and as the brain ages, iron accumulates in regions that are affected by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. High concentrations of reactive iron can increase oxidative-stress induced neuronal vulnerability, and iron accumulation might increase the toxicity of environmental or endogenous toxins. By studying the accumulation and cellular distribution of iron during ageing, we should be able to increase our understanding of these neurodegenerative disorders and develop new therapeutic strategies.","Priming is a nonconscious form of memory that involves a change in a person's ability to identify, produce or classify an item as a result of a previous encounter with that item or a related item. One important question relates to the specificity of priming - the extent to which priming reflects the influence of abstract representations or the retention of specific features of a previous episode. Cognitive neuroscience analyses provide evidence for three types of specificity: stimulus, associative and response. We consider empirical, methodological and conceptual issues that relate to each type of specificity, and suggest a theoretical perspective to help in guiding future research.","The learning and remembering of fearful events depends on the integrity of the amygdala, but how are fear memories represented in the activity of amygdala neurons? Here, we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies that combine unit recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory. Extinction of fear memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Understanding the signalling of aversive memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems that support fear behaviour.","Infants learn language with remarkable speed, but how they do it remains a mystery. New data show that infants use computational strategies to detect the statistical and prosodic patterns in language input, and that this leads to the discovery of phonemes and words. Social interaction with another human being affects speech learning in a way that resembles communicative learning in songbirds. The brain's commitment to the statistical and prosodic patterns that are experienced early in life might help to explain the long-standing puzzle of why infants are better language learners than adults. Successful learning by infants, as well as constraints on that learning, are changing theories of language acquisition.","Recent technological advances, such as functional imaging techniques, allow neuroscientists to measure and localize brain activity in healthy individuals. These techniques avoid many of the limitations of the traditional method for inferring brain function, which relies on examining patients with brain lesions. This has fueled the zeitgeist that the classical lesion method is an inferior and perhaps obsolescent technique. However, although the lesion method has important weaknesses, we argue that it complements the newer activation methods (and their weaknesses). Furthermore, recent developments can address many of the criticisms of the lesion method. Patients with brain lesions provide a unique window into brain function, and this approach will fill an important niche in future research.","The roof plate is an embryonic organizing centre that occupies the dorsal midline of the vertebrate neural tube. During early CNS development, the roof plate produces secreted factors, which control the specification and differentiation of dorsal neuronal cell types. An appreciation of the signalling properties of the roof plate has prompted an enhanced interest in this important organizing centre, and several recent studies have begun to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of roof plate development.","Mammals adapt to a rapidly changing world because of the sophisticated cognitive functions that are supported by the neocortex. The neocortex, which forms almost 80% of the human brain, seems to have arisen from repeated duplication of a stereotypical microcircuit template with subtle specializations for different brain regions and species. The quest to unravel the blueprint of this template started more than a century ago and has revealed an immensely intricate design. The largest obstacle is the daunting variety of inhibitory interneurons that are found in the circuit. This review focuses on the organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits.","Primary brain tumours are among the most lethal of all cancers, largely as a result of their lack of responsiveness to current therapy. Numerous new therapies hold great promise for the treatment of patients with brain cancer, but the main challenge is to determine which treatment is most likely to benefit an individual patient. DNA-microarray-based technologies, which allow simultaneous analysis of expression of thousands of genes, have already begun to uncover previously unrecognized patient subsets that differ in their survival. Here, we review the progress made so far in using DNA microarrays to optimize brain cancer therapy.","PDZ domains are protein-interaction domains that are often found in multi-domain scaffolding proteins. PDZ-containing scaffolds assemble specific proteins into large molecular complexes at defined locations in the cell. In the postsynaptic density of neuronal excitatory synapses, PDZ proteins such as PSD-95 organize glutamate receptors and their associated signalling proteins and determine the size and strength of synapses. PDZ scaffolds also function in the dynamic trafficking of synaptic proteins by assembling cargo complexes for transport by molecular motors. As key organizers that control synaptic protein composition and structure, PDZ scaffolds are themselves highly regulated by synthesis and degradation, subcellular distribution and post-translational modification.","Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) channels of small (SK) and intermediate (IK) conductance are present in a wide range of excitable and non-excitable cells. On activation by low concentrations of Ca(2+), they open, which results in hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and changes in cellular excitability. K(Ca)-channel activation also counteracts further increases in intracellular Ca(2+), thereby regulating the concentration of this ubiquitous intracellular messenger in space and time. K(Ca) channels have various functions, including the regulation of neuronal firing properties, blood flow and cell proliferation. The cloning of SK and IK channels has prompted investigations into their gating, pharmacology and organization into calcium-signalling domains, and has provided a framework that can be used to correlate molecularly identified K(Ca) channels with their native currents.","Our eyes send different 'images' of the outside world to the brain - an image of contours (line drawing), a colour image (watercolour painting) or an image of moving objects (movie). This is commonly referred to as parallel processing, and starts as early as the first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle. Here, the molecular composition of the transmitter receptors of the postsynaptic neurons defines which images are transferred to the inner retina. Within the second synaptic layer - the inner plexiform layer - circuits that involve complex inhibitory and excitatory interactions represent filters that select 'what the eye tells the brain'.","A fundamental question in visual perception is whether the representation of the fovea is split at the midline between the two hemispheres, or bilaterally represented by overlapping projections of the fovea in each hemisphere. Here we examine psychophysical, anatomical, neuropsychological and brain stimulation experiments that have addressed this question, and argue for a shift from the current default view of bilateral representation to that of a split representation, to provide a greater understanding of higher visual processes.","Developmental deficits that affect speech perception increase the risk of language and literacy problems, which can lead to lowered academic and occupational accomplishment. Normal development and disorders of speech perception have both been linked to temporospectral auditory processing speed. Understanding the role of dynamic auditory processing in speech perception and language comprehension has led to the development of neuroplasticity-based intervention strategies aimed at ameliorating language and literacy problems and their sequelae.","Although general anaesthesia has been of tremendous importance for the development of surgery, the underlying mechanisms by which this state is achieved are only just beginning to be understood in detail. In this review, we describe the neuronal systems that are thought to be involved in mediating clinically relevant actions of general anaesthetics, and we go on to discuss how the function of individual drug targets, in particular GABA(A)-receptor subtypes, can be revealed by genetic studies in vivo.","In birds and mammals, differences in development between the sexes arise from the differential actions of genes that are encoded on the sex chromosomes. These genes are differentially represented in the cells of males and females, and have been selected for sex-specific roles. The brain is a sexually dimorphic organ and is also shaped by sex-specific selection pressures. Genes on the sex chromosomes probably determine the gender (sexually dimorphic phenotype) of the brain in two ways: by acting on the gonads to induce sex differences in levels of gonadal secretions that have sex-specific effects on the brain, and by acting in the brain itself to differentiate XX and XY brain cells.","Developing neurons are programmed to die by an apoptotic pathway unless they are rescued by extrinsic growth factors that generate an anti-apoptotic response. By contrast, adult neurons need to survive for the lifetime of the organism, and their premature death can cause irreversible functional deficits. The default apoptotic pathway is shut down when development is complete, and consequently growth factors are no longer required to prevent death. To protect against accidental apoptotic cell death, anti-apoptotic mechanisms are activated in mature neurons in response to stress. Loss or reduced activity of these intrinsic anti-apoptotic 'brakes' might contribute to or accelerate neurodegeneration, whereas their activation might rescue neurons from injury or genetic abnormalities.","Treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the biggest unmet medical need in neurology. Current drugs improve symptoms, but do not have profound disease-modifying effects. Three main classes of disease-modification approaches can be defined: one that is broadly neurotrophic or neuroprotective, one that targets specific aspects of AD pathology, and one that is based on epidemiological observation. This review discusses all three approaches, with particular emphasis on anti-amyloid strategies - currently the most active area of investigation. The approaches that are reviewed include secretase inhibition, amyloid-beta aggregation inhibition, immunotherapy and strategies that might indirectly affect the amyloid pathway.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn1479 PMID: 15263896  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1478 PMID: 15263895  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1474 PMID: 15263894  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1475 PMID: 15263893  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1476 PMID: 15263892  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1473 PMID: 15263891  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1432 PMID: 15208700  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1426 PMID: 15208699  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1431 PMID: 15208698  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1430 PMID: 15208697  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1429 PMID: 15208696  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1427 PMID: 15208695  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1428 PMID: 15208694  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1410 PMID: 15152200  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1411 PMID: 15152199  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1406 PMID: 15152198  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1405 PMID: 15152197  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1407 PMID: 15152196  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1409 PMID: 15152195  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1408 PMID: 15152194  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1390 PMID: 15100724  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1389 PMID: 15100723  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1388 PMID: 15100722  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1370 PMID: 15100721  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1386 PMID: 15100720  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1385 PMID: 15100719  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1387 PMID: 15100718  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1369 PMID: 15034557  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1368 PMID: 15034556  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1397 PMID: 15034555  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2004 Jun;5(6):510.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1366 PMCID: PMC3590000 PMID: 15034553  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1365 PMID: 15034552  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE], ,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1347 PMID: 14976523  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1348 PMID: 14976522  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1345 PMID: 14976521  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1344 PMID: 14976520  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Carbohydrate-carrying molecules in the nervous system have important roles during development, regeneration and synaptic plasticity.

Hebb with the Hebbian synapse and the Hebbian learning rule, which underlie connectionist theories and synaptic plasticity, but Hebb's work has also influenced developmental psychology, neuropsychology, perception and the study of emotions, as well as learning and memory. Here, we review the work of Hebb and its lasting influence on neuroscience in honour of the 2004 centenary of his birth.","Brain function is inextricably coupled to water homeostasis. The fact that most of the volume between neurons is occupied by glial cells, leaving only a narrow extracellular space, represents an important challenge, as even small extracellular volume changes will affect ion concentrations and therefore neuronal excitability. Further, the ionic transmembrane shifts that are required to maintain ion homeostasis during neuronal activity must be accompanied by water. It follows that the mechanisms for water transport across plasma membranes must have a central part in brain physiology. These mechanisms are also likely to be of pathophysiological importance in brain oedema, which represents a net accumulation of water in brain tissue. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular basis for brain water transport and have identified a class of specialized water channels in the brain that might be crucial to the physiological and pathophysiological handling of water.","Recent data point to important roles for proteinases and their cognate proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) in the ontogeny and pathophysiology of the nervous system. PARs are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that can affect neural cell proliferation, morphology and physiology. PARs also have important roles in neuroinflammatory and degenerative diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia, Alzheimer's disease and pain. These receptors might also influence the pathogenesis of stroke and multiple sclerosis, conditions in which the blood-brain barrier is disrupted. The diversity of effects of PARs on neural function and their widespread distribution in the nervous system make them attractive therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Here, we review the roles of PARs in the central and peripheral nervous systems during health and disease, with a focus on neuroinflammatory and degenerative disorders.","Efficient and rapid propagation of action potentials in myelinated axons depends on the molecular specialization of the nodes of Ranvier. The nodal region is organized into several distinct domains, each of which contains a unique set of ion channels, cell-adhesion molecules and cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. Voltage-gated Na+ channels - which are concentrated at the nodes - are separated from K+ channels - which are clustered at the juxtaparanodal region - by a specialized axoglial contact that is formed between the axon and the myelinating cell at the paranodes. This local differentiation of myelinated axons is tightly regulated by oligodendrocytes and myelinating Schwann cells, and is achieved through complex mechanisms that are used by another specialized cell-cell contact - the synapse.","Several families of extracellular guidance cues have been implicated in guiding neurons and axons to their appropriate destinations in the nervous system. Their receptors include single- and seven-transmembrane receptors, and their signal transduction pathways converge onto the Rho family of small GTPases, which control the cytoskeleton. A single guidance protein can use different mechanisms to regulate different kinds of motility or the motilities of different cell types. There is crosstalk between the signalling pathways initiated by distinct guidance cues. Studies of neuronal guidance mechanisms have shed light not only on neural development, but also on other processes that involve the extracellular regulation of the cytoskeleton.","New genetic models that target the serotonin system show that transient alterations in serotonin homeostasis cause permanent changes to adult behaviour and modify the fine wiring of brain connections. These findings have revived a long-standing interest in the developmental role of serotonin. Molecular genetic approaches are now showing us that different serotonin receptors, acting at different developmental stages, modulate different developmental processes such as neurogenesis, apoptosis, axon branching and dendritogenesis. Our understanding of the specification of the serotonergic phenotype is improving. In addition, studies have revealed that serotonergic traits are dissociable, as there are populations of neurons that contain serotonin but do not synthesize it.","Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels have a wide range of functions including the control of neuronal signalling, heart rate, blood flow and insulin release. Because of the physiological importance of these channels, considerable effort has been invested in understanding the structural basis of their physiology. In this review, we use two recent, high-resolution structures as foundations for examining our current understanding of the fundamental functions that are shared by all K(+) channels, such as K(+) selectivity and channel gating, as well as characteristic features of Kir channel family members, such as inward rectification and their regulation by intracellular factors.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn1259 PMID: 14595404  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1258 PMID: 14595403  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1243 PMID: 14595402  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2006 Feb;7(2):167.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1248 PMID: 14595400  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1247 PMID: 14595399  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1246 PMID: 14595398  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 Oct;4(10):840-6.,Comment in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 Oct;4(10):846-9.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1201 PMID: 14523382  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1220 PMID: 14523381  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1221 PMID: 14523380  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1219 PMID: 14523379  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1222 PMID: 14523378  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1200 PMID: 12951568  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1197 PMID: 12951567  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 Dec;4(12):1019.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1199 PMID: 12951565  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1196 PMID: 12951564  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 Dec;4(12):1019.,"According to the 'mental time travel hypothesis' animals, unlike humans, cannot mentally travel backwards in time to recollect specific past events (episodic memory) or forwards to anticipate future needs (future planning). Until recently, there was little evidence in animals for either ability. Experiments on memory in food-caching birds, however, question this assumption by showing that western scrub-jays form integrated, flexible, trial-unique memories of what they hid, where and when. Moreover, these birds can adjust their caching behaviour in anticipation of future needs. We suggest that some animals have elements of both episodic-like memory and future planning.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn1174 PMID: 12894242  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1179 PMID: 12894241  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1177 PMID: 12894240  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1178 PMID: 12894239  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1176 PMID: 12894238  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1175 PMID: 12894237  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1139 PMID: 12838334  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1142 PMID: 12838333  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1137 PMID: 12838332  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1138 PMID: 12838331  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1140 PMID: 12838330  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1136 PMID: 12838329  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 Aug;4(8):691.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1117 PMID: 12778122  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1113 PMID: 12778121  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1118 PMID: 12778120  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1119 PMID: 12778119  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1115 PMID: 12778118  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1116 PMID: 12778117  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1114 PMID: 12778116  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1105 PMID: 12728268  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1106 PMID: 12728267  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1102 PMID: 12728266  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1103 PMID: 12728265  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1100 PMID: 12728264  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1104 PMID: 12728263  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1101 PMID: 12728262  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1079 PMID: 12671648  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1076 PMID: 12671647  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1078 PMID: 12671646  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1073 PMID: 12671645  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci. 2003 May;4(5):422.,DOI: 10.1038/nrn1074 PMID: 12671643  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1077 PMID: 12671642  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Although integration is a widely acknowledged goal in neuroscience, our approach to the function of biological entities often places boundaries that defy integration.

Early neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies found that visual awareness was best correlated with neural activity in extrastriate visual areas, but recent studies have found similarly powerful effects in V1. Lesion and inactivation studies have provided further evidence that V1 might be necessary for conscious perception. Whereas hierarchical models propose that damage to V1 simply disrupts the flow of information to extrastriate areas that are crucial for awareness, interactive models propose that recurrent connections between V1 and higher areas form functional circuits that support awareness. Further investigation into V1 and its interactions with higher areas might uncover fundamental aspects of the neural basis of visual awareness.","Recent studies combining psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments in behaving monkeys have provided new insights into how several cortical areas integrate efforts to solve a vibrotactile discrimination task. In particular, these studies have addressed how neural codes are related to perception, working memory and decision making in this model. The primary somatosensory cortex drives higher cortical areas where past and current sensory information are combined, such that a comparison of the two evolves into a behavioural decision. These and other observations in visual tasks indicate that decisions emerge from highly-distributed processes in which the details of a scheduled motor plan are gradually specified by sensory information.","The ability to detect and respond to novel events is crucial for survival in a rapidly changing environment. Four decades of neuroscientific research has begun to delineate the neural mechanisms by which the brain detects and responds to novelty. Here, we review this research and suggest how changes in neural processing at the cellular, synaptic and network levels allow us to detect, attend to and subsequently remember the occurrence of a novel event.","The visual recognition of complex movements and actions is crucial for the survival of many species. It is important not only for communication and recognition at a distance, but also for the learning of complex motor actions by imitation. Movement recognition has been studied in psychophysical, neurophysiological and imaging experiments, and several cortical areas involved in it have been identified. We use a neurophysiologically plausible and quantitative model as a tool for organizing and making sense of the experimental data, despite their growing size and complexity. We review the main experimental findings and discuss possible neural mechanisms, and show that a learning-based, feedforward model provides a neurophysiologically plausible and consistent summary of many key experimental results.","We are an intensely social species--it has been argued that our social nature defines what makes us human, what makes us conscious or what gave us our large brains. As a new field, the social brain sciences are probing the neural underpinnings of social behaviour and have produced a banquet of data that are both tantalizing and deeply puzzling. We are finding new links between emotion and reason, between action and perception, and between representations of other people and ourselves. No less important are the links that are also being established across disciplines to understand social behaviour, as neuroscientists, social psychologists, anthropologists, ethologists and philosophers forge new collaborations.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn1031 PMID: 12563286  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1033 PMID: 12563285  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1035 PMID: 12563284  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1034 PMID: 12563283  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1036 PMCID: PMC3503525 PMID: 12563282  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1032 PMID: 12563281  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1030 PMCID: PMC3373472 PMID: 12563280  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1011 PMID: 12511864  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1010 PMID: 12511863  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1006 PMID: 12511862  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1007 PMID: 12511861  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1009 PMID: 12511860  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1005 PMID: 12511859  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn1008 PMID: 12511858  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn985 PMID: 12461555  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn984 PMID: 12461554  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn988 PMID: 12461553  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn986 PMID: 12461552  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn989 PMID: 12461551  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn983 PMID: 12461550  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn987 PMID: 12461549  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn958 PMID: 12415298  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn962 PMID: 12415297  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn964 PMID: 12415296  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn959 PMID: 12415295  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn960 PMID: 12415294  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn961 PMID: 12415293  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn963 PMID: 12415292  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn938 PMID: 12360327  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn937 PMID: 12360326  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn942 PMID: 12360325  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn941 PMID: 12360324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn940 PMID: 12360323  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn939 PMID: 12360322  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn936 PMID: 12360321  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE], ,"Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, but many studies have expanded its functional repertoire by showing that glutamate receptors are present in a variety of non-excitable cells. How does glutamate receptor activation modulate their activity? Do non-excitable cells release glutamate, and, if so, how? These questions remain enigmatic. Here, we review the current knowledge on glutamatergic signalling in non-neuronal cells, with a special emphasis on astrocytes.","We argue that current theories of multisensory representations are inconsistent with the existence of a large proportion of multimodal neurons with gain fields and partially shifting receptive fields. Moreover, these theories do not fully resolve the recoding and statistical issues involved in multisensory integration. An alternative theory, which we have recently developed and review here, has important implications for the idea of 'frame of reference' in neural spatial representations. This theory is based on a neural architecture that combines basis functions and attractor dynamics. Basis function units are used to solve the recoding problem, whereas attractor dynamics are used for optimal statistical inferences. This architecture accounts for gain fields and partially shifting receptive fields, which emerge naturally as a result of the network connectivity and dynamics.","In the immature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is excitatory, and GABA-releasing synapses are formed before glutamatergic contacts in a wide range of species and structures. GABA becomes inhibitory by the delayed expression of a chloride exporter, leading to a negative shift in the reversal potential for choride ions. I propose that this mechanism provides a solution to the problem of how to excite developing neurons to promote growth and synapse formation while avoiding the potentially toxic effects of a mismatch between GABA-mediated inhibition and glutamatergic excitation. As key elements of this cascade are activity dependent, the formation of inhibition adds an element of nurture to the construction of cortical networks.","In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The unique features of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts as a developmental signal.","Multiple sclerosis is a common cause of neurological disability in young adults. The disease is complex -- its aetiology is multifactorial and largely unknown; its pathology is heterogeneous; and, clinically, it is difficult to diagnose, manage and treat. However, perhaps its most frustrating aspect is the inadequacy of the healing response of remyelination. This regenerative process generally occurs with great efficiency in experimental models, and sometimes proceeds to completion in multiple sclerosis. But as the disease progresses, the numbers of lesions in which demyelination persists increases, significantly contributing to clinical deterioration. Understanding why remyelination fails is crucial for devising effective methods by which to enhance it.","The sprouting of neurites, which will later become axons and dendrites, is an important event in early neuronal differentiation. Studies in living neurons indicate that neuritogenesis begins immediately after neuronal commitment, with the activation of membrane receptors by extracellular cues. These receptors activate intracellular cascades that trigger changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which promote the initial breakdown of symmetry. Then, through the regulation of gene transcription, and of microtubule and membrane dynamics, the newly formed neurite becomes stabilized. A key challenge is to define the molecular machinery that regulates the actin cytoskeleton during initial neurite sprouting. We propose that analysing the molecules involved in actin-dependent mechanisms in non-neuronal systems, such as budding yeast and migrating fibroblasts, could help to uncover the secrets of neuritogenesis.","Sleep can be addressed across the entire hierarchy of biological organization. We discuss neuronal-network and regional forebrain activity during sleep, and its consequences for consciousness and cognition. Complex interactions in thalamocortical circuits maintain the electroencephalographic oscillations of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Functional neuroimaging affords views of the human brain in both NREM and REM sleep, and has informed new concepts of the neural basis of dreaming during REM sleep -- a state that is characterized by illogic, hallucinosis and emotionality compared with waking. Replay of waking neuronal activity during sleep in the rodent hippocampus and in functional images of human brains indicates possible roles for sleep in neuroplasticity. Different forms and stages of learning and memory might benefit from different stages of sleep and be subserved by different forebrain regions.", ,DOI: 10.1038/nrn898 PMID: 12154365  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn897 PMID: 12154364  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn896 PMID: 12154363  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn893 PMID: 12154362  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn895 PMID: 12154361  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Animal models of neurological deficits are essential for the assessment of new therapeutic options. It has been suggested that rats are not as appropriate as primates for the symptomatic modelling of disease, but a large body of data argues against this view. Comparative analyses of movements in rats and primates show homology of many motor patterns across species. Advances have been made in identifying rat equivalents of akinesia, tremor, postural deficits and dyskinesia, which are relevant to Parkinson's disease. Rat models of hemiplegia, neglect and tactile extinction are useful in assessing the outcome of ischaemic or traumatic brain injury, and in monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions. Studies in rodents that emphasize careful behavioural analysis should continue to be developed as effective and inexpensive models that complement studies in primates.","The amygdala -- an almond-shaped group of nuclei at the heart of the telencephalon -- has been associated with a range of cognitive functions, including emotion, learning, memory, attention and perception. Most current views of amygdala function emphasize its role in negative emotions, such as fear, and in linking negative emotions with other aspects of cognition, such as learning and memory. However, recent evidence supports a role for the amygdala in processing positive emotions as well as negative ones, including learning about the beneficial biological value of stimuli. Indeed, the amygdala's role in stimulus-reward learning might be just as important as its role in processing negative affect and fear conditioning.","Orchestrating a movement towards a sensory target requires many computational processes, including a transformation between reference frames. This transformation is important because the reference frames in which sensory stimuli are encoded often differ from those of motor effectors. The posterior parietal cortex has an important role in these transformations. Recent work indicates that a significant proportion of parietal neurons in two cortical areas transforms the sensory signals that are used to guide movements into a common reference frame. This common reference frame is an eye-centred representation that is modulated by eye-, head-, body- or limb-position signals. A common reference frame might facilitate communication between different areas that are involved in coordinating the movements of different effectors. It might also be an efficient way to represent the locations of different sensory targets in the world.","The navigational strategies that are used by foraging ants and bees to reach a goal are similar to those of birds and mammals. Species from all these groups use path integration and memories of visual landmarks to navigate through familiar terrain. Insects have far fewer neural resources than vertebrates, so data from insects might be useful in revealing the essential components of efficient navigation. Recent work on ants and bees has uncovered a major role for associative links between long-term memories. We emphasize the roles of these associations in the reliable recognition of visual landmarks and the reliable performance of learnt routes. It is unknown whether such associations also provide insects with a map-like representation of familiar terrain. We suggest, however, that landmarks act primarily as signposts that tell insects what particular action they need to perform, rather than telling them where they are.","The specification of neurotransmitter phenotype is an important aspect of neuronal fate determination. Substantial progress has been made in uncovering key extracellular signals and transcriptional regulators that control the mode of neurotransmission in several model systems, among which catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons feature prominently. Here, we review our current knowledge of the regulatory circuits that direct neurotransmitter choice, and discuss the development of well-studied types of catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons. One emerging concept is that different types of neuron use a similar core programme to control shared modes of neurotransmission, but recruit different factors that are specific for each neuronal type. Another is that most factors that specify neurotransmitter identity also control other features of the neuronal phenotype.","Certain morphological, physiological and molecular characteristics are shared by all neurons. However, despite these similarities, neurons constitute the most diverse cell population of any organism. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie this cellular diversity. Parallel studies in Drosophila and vertebrates have revealed that proneural genes are key regulators of neurogenesis, coordinating the acquisition of a generic neuronal fate and of specific subtype identities that are appropriate for the location and time of neuronal generation. These studies reveal that, in spite of differences between invertebrate and vertebrate neural lineages, Drosophila and vertebrate proneural genes have remarkably similar roles.","Synapses are not static; their performance is modified adaptively in response to activity. Presynaptic mechanisms that affect the probability of transmitter release or the amount of transmitter that is released are important in synaptic diversification. Here, we address the diversity of presynaptic performance and its underlying mechanisms: how much of the variation can be accounted for by variation in synaptic morphology and how much by molecular differences? Significant progress has been made in defining presynaptic structural contributions to synaptic strength; by contrast, we know little about how presynaptic proteins produce normally observed functional differentiation, despite abundant information on presynaptic proteins and on the effects of their individual manipulation. Closing the gap between molecular and physiological synaptic diversification still represents a considerable challenge.","Complex traits, including many disease-related traits, are influenced by multiple genes. Bivariate approaches that associate one gene with one trait are yielding to multivariate methods to synthesize the effects of multiple genes, integrate results across independent studies, and aid in the identification of coordinated pathways and interactions between loci.","Studies of experience-driven neuroplasticity at the behavioural, ensemble, cellular and molecular levels have shown that the structure and significance of the eliciting stimulus can determine the neural changes that result. Studying such effects in humans is difficult, but professional musicians represent an ideal model in which to investigate plastic changes in the human brain. There are two advantages to studying plasticity in musicians: the complexity of the eliciting stimulus music and the extent of their exposure to this stimulus. Here, we focus on the functional and anatomical differences that have been detected in musicians by modern neuroimaging methods.","What is the nature of our ability to understand and reason about the beliefs of others--the possession of a ""theory of mind"", or ToM? Here, we review findings from imaging and lesion studies indicating that ToM reasoning is supported by a widely distributed neural system. Some functional components of this system, such as language-related regions of the left hemisphere, the frontal lobes and the right temporal parietal cortex, are not solely dedicated to the computation of mental states. However, the system also includes a core, domain-specific component that is centred on the amygdala circuitry. We provide a framework in which impairments of ToM can be viewed in terms of abnormalities of the core system, the failure of a co-opted system that is necessary for performance on a particular set of tasks, or the absence of an experiential trigger for the emergence of ToM.","Stress is a biologically significant factor that, by altering brain cell properties, can disturb cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and consequently limit the quality of human life. Extensive rodent and human research has shown that the hippocampus is not only crucially involved in memory formation, but is also highly sensitive to stress. So, the study of stress-induced cognitive and neurobiological sequelae in animal models might provide valuable insight into the mnemonic mechanisms that are vulnerable to stress. Here, we provide an overview of the neurobiology of stress memory interactions, and present a neural endocrine model to explain how stress modifies hippocampal functioning.","Animal studies have shown that sensory deprivation in one modality can have striking effects on the development of the remaining modalities. Although recent studies of deaf and blind humans have also provided convincing behavioural, electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence of increased capabilities and altered organization of spared modalities, there is still much debate about the identity of the brain systems that are changed and the mechanisms that mediate these changes. Plastic changes across brain systems and related behaviours vary as a function of the timing and the nature of changes in experience. This specificity must be understood in the context of differences in the maturation rates and timing of the associated critical periods, differences in patterns of transiently existing connections, and differences in molecular factors across brain systems.","In addition to its role as a sex hormone, oestrogen affects the structure and function of the nervous system. Oestrogen receptors are expressed in brain regions that are involved in sex differentiation and maturation. But in addition to its well-known effects, oestrogen also has important neuroprotective actions that are both dependent and independent of a nuclear oestrogen-receptor activity. Furthermore, oestrogen can interact with neuroprotective intracellular signalling pathways and is itself a neuroprotective antioxidant. Understanding the mechanisms of oestrogen action will be crucial to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent, particularly in the elderly.","The conventional scheme of cortical formation shows that postmitotic neurons migrate away from the germinal ventricular zone to their positions in the developing cortex, guided by the processes of radial glial cells. However, recent studies indicate that different neuronal types adopt distinct modes of migration in the developing cortex. Here, we review evidence for two modes of radial movement: somal translocation, which is adopted by the early-generated neurons; and glia-guided locomotion, which is used predominantly by pyramidal cells. Cortical interneurons, which originate in the ventral telencephalon, use a third mode of migration. They migrate tangentially into the cortex, then seek the ventricular zone before moving radially to take up their positions in the cortical anlage.","There is a pressing need for treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Hopes have been raised by the prospect of neural stem cell therapy; however, despite intense research activities and media attention, stem cell therapy for neurological disorders is still a distant goal. Effective strategies must be developed to isolate, enrich and propagate homogeneous populations of neural stem cells, and to identify the molecules and mechanisms that are required for their proper integration into the injured brain. This article examines these requirements, discusses the results obtained so far, and considers the steps that need to be taken to provide instruction to donor cells and to elucidate the neurogenic potential of the adult central nervous system environment.","For more than 1,500 years, nerves were thought to function through the action of 'animal spirits'. In the seventeenth century, René Descartes conceived of these 'spirits' as liquids or gases, and used the idea to explain reflex action. But he was rapidly proven wrong by a young Dutchman, Jan Swammerdam. Swammerdam's elegant experiments pioneered the frog nerve muscle preparation and laid the foundation of our modern understanding of nerve function.","Members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) families comprising neurotrophins and GDNF-family ligands (GFLs), respectively are crucial for the development and maintenance of distinct sets of central and peripheral neurons. Knockout studies in the mouse have revealed that members of these two families might collaborate or act sequentially in a given neuron. Although neurotrophins and GFLs activate common intracellular signalling pathways through their receptor tyrosine kinases, several clear differences exist between these families of trophic factors.","Childhood absence epilepsy is an idiopathic, generalized non-convulsive epilepsy with a multifactorial genetic aetiology. Molecular-genetic analyses of affected human families and experimental models, together with neurobiological investigations, have led to important breakthroughs in the identification of candidate genes and loci, and potential pathophysiological mechanisms for this type of epilepsy. Here, we review these results, and compare the human and experimental phenotypes that have been investigated. Continuing efforts and comparisons of this type will help us to elucidate the multigenetic traits and pathophysiology of this form of generalized epilepsy.","A key goal in neuroscience is to explain how the operations of a neuron emerge from sets of active channels with specific dendritic distributions. If general principles can be identified for these distributions, dendritic channels should reflect the computational role of a given cell type within its functional neural circuit. Here, we discuss insights from experimental and computational data on the distribution of voltage-gated channels in dendrites, and attempt to derive rules for how their interactions implement different dendritic functions. We propose that this type of analysis will be important for understanding behavioural processes in terms of single-neuron properties, and that it constitutes a step towards a 'functional proteomics' of nerve cells, which will be essential for defining neuronal phenotypes.","Locomotion in vertebrates and invertebrates has a long history in research as the most prominent example of interlimb coordination. However, the evolution towards upright stance and gait has paved the way for a bewildering variety of functions in which the upper limbs interact with each other in a context-specific manner. The neural basis of these bimanual interactions has been investigated in recent years on different scales, ranging from the single-cell level to the analysis of neuronal assemblies. Although the prevailing viewpoint has been to assign bimanual coordination to a single brain locus, more recent evidence points to a distributed network that governs the processes of neural synchronization and desynchronization that underlie the rich variety of coordinated functions. The distributed nature of this network accounts for disruptions of interlimb coordination across various movement disorders.","Over a short period in the late 1990s, three groups converged on the discovery of a neuropeptide system, centred in the dorsolateral hypothalamus, that regulates arousal states, influences feeding and is implicated in the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Subsequent studies have illuminated many aspects of the circuitry of the hypocretin (also called orexin) system, which also influences hormone secretion and autonomic homeostasis, and have led to the hypothesis that most human narcolepsies result from an autoimmune attack against the hypocretin-producing neurons. The biochemical, physiological and anatomical components that regulate the switch between waking and sleeping are becoming clear. The rapidity with which the hypocretin story has emerged is a testament to both the conceptual and the technical evolution of genomic science in the past two decades.",DOI: 10.1038/nrn790 PMID: 11967564  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn789 PMID: 11967563  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn788 PMID: 11967562  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn787 PMID: 11967561  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn782 PMID: 11967560  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn784 PMID: 11967559  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn785 PMID: 11967558  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn786 PMID: 11967557  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/nrn783 PMID: 11967556  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Functional imaging gives us increasingly detailed information about the location of brain activity. To use this information, we need a clear conception of the meaning of location data. Here, we review methods for reporting location in functional imaging and discuss the problems that arise from the great variability in brain anatomy between individuals. These problems cause uncertainty in localization, which limits the effective resolution of functional imaging, especially for brain areas involved in higher cognitive function.","Human neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of specific neuronal populations, resulting in substantial disability and early death. The identification of causative single-gene mutations in families with inherited neurodegenerative disorders has facilitated the modelling of these diseases in experimental organisms, including the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Many neurodegenerative diseases have now been successfully modelled in Drosophila, and genetic analysis is under way in each of these models. Using fruitfly genetics to define the molecular pathways that underlie the neurodegenerative process is likely to improve substantially our understanding of the pathogenesis of the human diseases, and to provide new therapeutic targets.","Recent discoveries about how the central nervous system responds to injury and how patients reacquire lost behaviours by training have yielded promising new therapies for neurorehabilitation. Until recently, this field had been largely static, but the current melding of basic behavioural science with neuroscience promises entirely new approaches to improving behavioural, perceptual and cognitive capabilities after neurological damage. Studies of phenomena such as cortical reorganization after a lesion, central nervous system repair, and the substantial enhancement of extremity use and linguistic function by behavioural therapy, support this emerging view. The ongoing changes in rehabilitation strategies might well amount to an impending paradigm shift in this field.","Innate immunity was previously thought to be a nonspecific immunological programme that was engaged by peripheral organs to maintain homeostasis after stress and injury. Emerging evidence indicates that this highly organized response also takes place in the central nervous system. Through the recognition of neuronal fingerprints, the long-term induction of the innate immune response and its transition to an adaptive form might be central to the pathophysiology and aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Paradoxically, this response also protects neurons by favouring remyelination and trophic support afforded by glial cells.","We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.","Reviews on the visual system generally praise its amazing performance. Here we deal with its biggest weakness: sluggishness. Inherent delays lead to mislocalization when things move or, more generally, when things change. Errors in time translate into spatial errors when we pursue a moving object, when we try to localize a target that appears just before a gaze shift, or when we compare the position of a flashed target with the instantaneous position of a continuously moving one (or one that appears to be moving even though no change occurs in the retinal image). Studying such diverse errors might rekindle our thinking about how the brain copes with real-time changes in the world.","Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus has been the primary model by which to study the cellular and molecular basis of memory. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is necessary for LTP induction, is persistently activated by stimuli that elicit LTP, and can, by itself, enhance the efficacy of synaptic transmission. The analysis of CaMKII autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation indicates that this kinase could serve as a molecular switch that is capable of long-term memory storage. Consistent with such a role, mutations that prevent persistent activation of CaMKII block LTP, experience-dependent plasticity and behavioural memory. These results make CaMKII a leading candidate in the search for the molecular basis of memory.","H.M. became amnesic in 1953. Since that time, nearly 100 investigators, first at the Montreal Neurological Institute and since 1966 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have participated in studying him. We all understand the rare opportunity we have had to work with him, and we are grateful for his dedication to research. He has taught us a great deal about the cognitive and neural organization of memory. We are in his debt.","In recent years, cognitive neuroscientists have taken great advantage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a non-invasive method of measuring neuronal activity in the human brain. But what exactly does fMRI tell us? We know that its signals arise from changes in local haemodynamics that, in turn, result from alterations in neuronal activity, but exactly how neuronal activity, haemodynamics and fMRI signals are related is unclear. It has been assumed that the fMRI signal is proportional to the local average neuronal activity, but many factors can influence the relationship between the two. A clearer understanding of how neuronal activity influences the fMRI signal is needed if we are correctly to interpret functional imaging data.","In this article, I discuss the use of neurally driven evolutionary autonomous agents (EAAs) in neuroscientific investigations. Two fundamental questions are addressed. Can EAA studies shed new light on the structure and function of biological nervous systems? And can these studies lead to the development of new tools for neuroscientific analysis? The value and significant potential of EAA modelling in both respects is demonstrated and discussed. Although the study of EAAs for neuroscience research still faces difficult conceptual and technical challenges, it is a promising and timely endeavour.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci 2002 Mar;3(3):236.,"The molecular basis of K+ channel function is universally conserved. K+ channels allow K+ flux and are essential for the generation of electric current across excitable membranes. K+ channels are also the targets of various intracellular control mechanisms, such that the suboptimal regulation of channel function might be related to pathological conditions. Because of the fundamental role of K+ channels in controlling membrane excitability, a structural understanding of their function and regulation will provide a useful framework for understanding neuronal physiology. Many recent physiological and crystallographic studies have led to new insights into the workings of K+ channels.","The conversion of acetylcholine binding into ion conduction across the membrane is becoming more clearly understood in terms of the structure of the receptor and its transitions. A high-resolution structure of a protein that is homologous to the extracellular domain of the receptor has revealed the binding sites and subunit interfaces in great detail. Although the structures of the membrane and cytoplasmic domains are less well determined, the channel lining and the determinants of selectivity have been mapped. The location and structure of the gates, and the coupling between binding sites and gates, remain to be established.","As in the case of many ligand-gated ion channels, the biochemical and electrophysiological properties of the ionotropic glutamate receptors have been studied extensively. Nevertheless, we still do not understand the molecular mechanisms that harness the free energy of agonist binding, first to drive channel opening, and then to allow the channel to close (desensitize) even though agonist remains bound. Recent crystallographic analyses of the ligand-binding domains of these receptors have identified conformational changes associated with agonist binding, yielding a working hypothesis of channel function. This opens the way to determining how the domains and subunits are assembled into an oligomeric channel, how the domains are connected, how the channel is formed, and where it is located relative to the ligand-binding domains, all of which govern the processes of channel activation and desensitization.","Ricardo Miledi has made significant contributions to our basic understanding of how synapses work. Here I discuss aspects of Miledi's research that helped to establish the requirement of presynaptic calcium for neurotransmitter release, from his earliest scientific studies to his classic experiments in the squid giant synapse.","Reports of continuous genesis and turnover of neurons in the adult primate association neocortex--the site of the highest cognitive functions--have generated great excitement. Here, I review the available evidence, and question the scientific basis of this claim.","Synapses show widely varying degrees of short-term facilitation and depression. Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie short-term plasticity, but the contributions of presynaptic mechanisms have been particularly difficult to study because of the small size of synaptic boutons in the mammalian brain. Here we review the functional properties of the calyx of Held, a giant nerve terminal that has shed new light on the general mechanisms that control short-term plasticity. The calyx of Held has also provided fresh insights into the strategies used by synapses to extend their dynamic range of operation and preserve the timing of sensory stimuli.","An enduring question in cognitive neuroscience is how the physical properties of the world are represented in the brain to yield conscious perception. In most people, a particular physical stimulus gives rise to a unitary, unimodal perceptual experience. So, light energy leads to the sensation of seeing, whereas sound waves produce the experience of hearing. However, for individuals with the rare phenomenon of synaesthesia, specific physical stimuli consistently induce more than one perceptual experience. For example, hearing particular sounds might induce vivid experiences of colour, taste or odour, as might the sight of visual symbols, such as letters or digits. Here we review the latest findings on synaesthesia, and consider its possible genetic, neural and cognitive bases. We also propose a neurocognitive framework for understanding such anomalous perceptual experiences.","The development of ocular dominance columns has served as a Rosetta stone for understanding the mechanisms that guide the construction of cortical circuits. Traditionally, the emergence of ocular dominance columns was thought to be closely tied to the critical period, during which columnar architecture is highly susceptible to alterations in visual input. However, recent findings in cats, monkeys and ferrets indicate that columns develop far earlier, more rapidly and with considerably greater precision than was previously suspected. These observations indicate that the initial establishment of cortical functional architecture, and its subsequent plasticity during the critical period, are distinct developmental phases that might reflect distinct mechanisms.","The development of the vertebrate brain involves the creation of many cell types in precise locations and at precise times, followed by the formation of functional connections. To generate its cells in the correct numbers, the brain has to produce many precursors during a limited period. How this is achieved remains unclear, although several cytokines have been implicated in the proliferation of neural precursors. Understanding this process will provide profound insights, not only into the formation of the mammalian brain during ontogeny, but also into brain evolution. Here we review the role of the Sonic hedgehog-Gli pathway in brain development. Specifically, we discuss the role of this pathway in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, and address the implications of these findings for morphological plasticity. We also highlight future directions of research that could help to clarify the mechanisms and consequences of Sonic hedgehog signalling in the brain.","Binocular rivalry--the alternations in perception that occur when different images are presented to the two eyes--has been the subject of intensive investigation for more than 160 years. The psychophysical properties of binocular rivalry have been well described, but newer imaging and electrophysiological techniques have not resolved the issue of where in the brain rivalry occurs. The most recent evidence supports a view of rivalry as a series of processes, each of which is implemented by neural mechanisms at different levels of the visual hierarchy. Although unanswered questions remain, this view of rivalry might allow us to resolve some of the controversies and apparent contradictions that have emerged from its study.",DOI: 10.1038/35104061 PMID: 11733795  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104092 PMID: 11733799  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104085 PMID: 11733798  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104078 PMID: 11733797  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104069 PMID: 11733796  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104055 PMID: 11733794  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35104049 PMID: 11733793  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097597 PMID: 11715062  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097593 PMID: 11715061  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097587 PMID: 11715060  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097581 PMID: 11715059  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097575 PMID: 11715058  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Comment in Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2002 Jun;3(2):55-6.,DOI: 10.1038/35097557 PMID: 11715056  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097509 PMID: 11715055  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097516 PMID: 11715054  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35097549 PMID: 11715053  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE], , ,"In the classical model of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulation, arrestins terminate receptor signalling. After receptor activation, arrestins desensitize phosphorylated GPCRs, blocking further activation and initiating receptor internalization. This function of arrestins is exemplified by studies on the role of arrestins in the development of tolerance to, but not dependence on, morphine. Arrestins also link GPCRs to several signalling pathways, including activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC and mitogen-activated protein kinase. In these cascades, arrestins function as adaptors and scaffolds, bringing sequentially acting kinases into proximity with each other and the receptor. The signalling roles of arrestins have been expanded even further with the discovery that the formation of stable receptor-arrestin complexes initiates photoreceptor apoptosis in Drosophila, leading to retinal degeneration. Here we review our current understanding of arrestin function, discussing both its classical and newly discovered roles.","What are the psychological, computational and neural underpinnings of language? Are these neurocognitive correlates dedicated to language? Do different parts of language depend on distinct neurocognitive systems? Here I address these and other issues that are crucial for our understanding of two fundamental language capacities: the memorization of words in the mental lexicon, and the rule-governed combination of words by the mental grammar. According to the declarative/procedural model, the mental lexicon depends on declarative memory and is rooted in the temporal lobe, whereas the mental grammar involves procedural memory and is rooted in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. I argue that the declarative/procedural model provides a new framework for the study of lexicon and grammar.","Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device. By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.","People take addictive drugs to elevate mood, but with repeated use these drugs produce serious unwanted effects, which can include tolerance to some drug effects, sensitization to others, and an adapted state - dependence - which sets the stage for withdrawal symptoms when drug use stops. The most serious consequence of repetitive drug taking, however, is addiction: a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control, even when serious negative consequences ensue. Addiction is characterized by a long-lasting risk of relapse, which is often initiated by exposure to drug-related cues. Substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, but as yet we understand little of the neural substrates of compulsive drug use and its remarkable persistence. Here we review evidence for the possibility that compulsion and its persistence are based on a pathological usurpation of molecular mechanisms that are normally involved in memory.","Functional brain imaging in humans has revealed task-specific increases in brain activity that are associated with various mental activities. In the same studies, mysterious, task-independent decreases have also frequently been encountered, especially when the tasks of interest have been compared with a passive state, such as simple fixation or eyes closed. These decreases have raised the possibility that there might be a baseline or resting state of brain function involving a specific set of mental operations. We explore this possibility, including the manner in which we might define a baseline and the implications of such a baseline for our understanding of brain function.",DOI: 10.1038/35090060 PMID: 11533734  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35090026 PMID: 11533733  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35090015 PMID: 11533732  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35090055 PMID: 11533731  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35090048 PMID: 11533730  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35090039 PMID: 11533729  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35086072 PMID: 11484003  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35086067 PMID: 11484002  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Involuntary movements--or dyskinesias--are a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease, and is experienced in most patients. Despite the importance of this problem, little was known about the cause of dyskinesia until recently; however, this situation has changed significantly in the past few years. Our increased understanding of levodopa-induced dyskinesia is not only valuable for improving patient care, but also in providing us with new insights into the functional organization of the basal ganglia and motor systems.",DOI: 10.1038/35086057 PMID: 11484000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35086023 PMID: 11483999  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35086018 PMID: 11483998  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35086012 PMCID: PMC2868968 PMID: 11483997  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35081582 PMID: 11433377  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci 2001 Sep;2(9):670.,DOI: 10.1038/35081571 PMID: 11433375  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35081564 PMID: 11433374  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35081558 PMID: 11433373  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35081509 PMID: 11433372  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci 2001 Sep;2(9):670.,"Making sense of microarray data is a complex process, in which the interpretation of findings will depend on the overall experimental design and judgement of the investigator performing the analysis. As a result, differences in tissue harvesting, microarray types, sample labelling and data analysis procedures make post hoc sharing of microarray data a great challenge. To ensure rapid and meaningful data exchange, we need to create some order out of the existing chaos. In these ground-breaking microarray standardization and data sharing efforts, NIH agencies should take a leading role","Microarray expression profiling is instrumental to our understanding of the function of the genome. Resolution of functionally relevant expression patterns will require the analysis of large data sets compiled from multiple investigators. For this and other reasons, I argue that it is crucial for array data to be publicly shared in a format as close to the 'raw data' as possible. Issues such as protection of intellectual property, ensuring quality of the data, and the format and timing for sharing array data are also discussed.","During the initial development of microarrays, much discussion revolved around the technology itself. The discussion has now shifted to data analysis and data sharing. There is great interest in the sharing of cDNA microarray data, but several issues related to format, quality and validation will need to be resolved before microarray data can be meaningfully integrated into other molecular databases.","Sharing of microarray data has many advantages for the scientific and biomedical community, and should be advocated by neuroscience journals. The goals of sharing are manifold, and include improving analysis and confidence in results, and facilitating global comparisons between experiments, while at the same time, not penalizing those who share. The sharing of microarray data poses unique challenges relative to more generic data such as DNA sequences. These challenges are surmountable, and various sharing formats are possible. Centralized non-commercial databases are being developed to facilitate this process.","Although gap junctions were first demonstrated in the mammalian brain about 30 years ago, the distribution and role of electrical synapses have remained elusive. A series of recent reports has demonstrated that inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum and cerebellum are extensively interconnected by electrical synapses. Investigators have used paired recordings to reveal directly the presence of electrical synapses among identified cell types. These studies indicate that electrical coupling is a fundamental feature of local inhibitory circuits and suggest that electrical synapses define functionally diverse networks of GABA-releasing interneurons. Here, we discuss these results, their possible functional significance and the insights into neuronal circuit organization that have emerged from them.","Controversy surrounds the function of the anterior cingulate cortex. Recent discussions about its role in behavioural control have centred on three main issues: its involvement in motor control, its proposed role in cognition and its relationship with the arousal/drive state of the organism. I argue that the overlap of these three domains is key to distinguishing the anterior cingulate cortex from other frontal regions, placing it in a unique position to translate intentions to actions.","Neuronal migration, like the migration of many cell types, requires an extensive rearrangement of cell shape, mediated by changes in the cytoskeleton. The genetic analysis of human brain malformations has identified several biochemical players in this process, including doublecortin (DCX) and LIS1, mutations of which cause a profound migratory disturbance known as lissencephaly ('smooth brain') in humans. Studies in mice have identified additional molecules such as Cdk5, P35, Reelin, Disabled and members of the LDL superfamily of receptors. Understanding the cell biology of these molecules has been a challenge, and it is not known whether they function in related biochemical pathways or in very distinct processes. The last year has seen rapid advances in the biochemical analysis of several such molecules. This analysis has revealed roles for some of these molecules in cytoskeletal regulation and has shown an unexpected conservation of the genetic pathways that regulate neuronal migration in humans and nuclear movement in simple eukaryotic organisms.","Voltage-gated Na+ channels set the threshold for action potential generation and are therefore good candidates to mediate forms of plasticity that affect the entire neuronal output. Although early studies led to the idea that Na+ channels were not subject to modulation, we now know that Na+ channel function is affected by phosphorylation. Furthermore, Na+ channel modulation is implicated in the control of input-output relationships in several types of neuron and seems to be involved in phenomena as varied as cocaine withdrawal, hyperalgesia and light adaptation. Here we review the available evidence for the regulation of Na+ channels by phosphorylation, its molecular mechanism, and the possible ways in which it affects neuronal function.","Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) channel gene encode a family of at least 20 ion channel proteins. They are widely distributed in mammalian tissues, but their specific physiological functions are largely unknown. A common theme that links the TRP channels is their activation or modulation by phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathways. The channel subunits have six transmembrane domains that most probably assemble into tetramers to form non-selective cationic channels, which allow for the influx of calcium ions into cells. Three subgroups comprise the TRP channel family; the best understood of these mediates responses to painful stimuli. Other proposed functions include repletion of intracellular calcium stores, receptor-mediated excitation and modulation of the cell cycle.","Several recent publications describe remarkably promising effects of transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells as a potential future method to repair human spinal cord injuries. But why were cells from the nose transplanted into the spinal cord? What are olfactory ensheathing cells, and how might they produce these beneficial effects? And more generally, what do we mean by spinal cord injury? To what extent can we compare repair in an animal to repair in a human?", ,"For over 60 years, ideas about emotion in neuroscience and psychology have been dominated by a debate on whether emotion can be encompassed within a single, unifying model. In neuroscience, this approach is epitomized by the limbic system theory and, in psychology, by dimensional models of emotion. Comparative research has gradually eroded the limbic model, and some scientists have proposed that certain individual emotions are represented separately in the brain. Evidence from humans consistent with this approach has recently been obtained by studies indicating that signals of fear and disgust are processed by distinct neural substrates. We review this research and its implications for theories of emotion.","Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide, but we know little about the underlying fundamental biology. Research is hindered by the difficulties of modelling a disorder of higher cognitive functions in animals. Depression can be understood as the interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors; however, current classifications are purely descriptive. The complexity of this field is best approached by rigorous explorations of known candidate systems in conjunction with the use of genomic tools to discover new targets for antidepressants and to predict therapeutic outcomes.","Recent studies have shown that components of the cell-cycle machinery can have diverse and unexpected roles in the retina. Cyclin-kinase inhibitors, for example, have been implicated as regulators of cell-fate decisions during histogenesis and reactive gliosis in the adult tissue after injury. Also, various mechanisms have been identified that can compensate for extra rounds of cell division when the normal timing of the cell-cycle exit is perturbed. Surprisingly, distinct components of the cell-cycle machinery seem to be used during different stages of development, and different organisms might rely on distinct pathways. Such detailed studies on the regulation of proliferation in complex multicellular tissues during development have not only advanced our knowledge of the ways in which proliferation is controlled, but might also help us to understand the degenerative disorders that are associated with gliosis and some types of tumorigenesis.","Research into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been rapidly advanced by the development of animal models. Initial models were developed by using toxins that specifically targeted dopamine neurons, the most successful of which used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a toxin that causes parkinsonism in man. More recently, the identification of alpha-synuclein mutations as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease has led to the development of alpha-synuclein transgenic mice and Drosophila. Here, I discuss the merits and limitations of these different animal models in our attempts to understand the physiology of Parkinson's disease and to develop new therapies.","Activity-mediated changes in the strength of synaptic communication are important for the establishment of proper neuronal connections during development and for the experience-dependent modification of neural circuitry that is believed to underlie all forms of behavioural plasticity. Owing to the wide-ranging significance of synaptic plasticity, considerable efforts have been made to identify the mechanisms by which synaptic changes are triggered and expressed. New evidence indicates that one important expression mechanism of several long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity might involve the physical transport of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in and out of the synaptic membrane. Here, we focus on the rapidly accumulating evidence that AMPA receptors undergo regulated endocytosis, which is important for long-term depression.", , ,"Examples of G-protein-coupled receptors that can be biochemically detected in homo- or heteromeric complexes are emerging at an accelerated rate. Biophysical approaches have confirmed the existence of several such complexes in living cells and there is strong evidence to support the idea that dimerization is important in different aspects of receptor biogenesis and function. While the existence of G-protein-coupled-receptor homodimers raises fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms involved in transmitter recognition and signal transduction, the formation of heterodimers raises fascinating combinatorial possibilities that could underlie an unexpected level of pharmacological diversity, and contribute to cross-talk regulation between transmission systems. Because G-protein-coupled receptors are major pharmacological targets, the existence of dimers could have important implications for the development and screening of new drugs. Here, we review the evidence supporting the existence of G-protein-coupled-receptor dimerization and discuss its functional importance.","Although spontaneous regeneration of lesioned fibres is limited in the adult central nervous system, many people that suffer from incomplete spinal cord injuries show significant functional recovery. This recovery process can go on for several years after the injury and probably depends on the reorganization of circuits that have been spared by the lesion. Synaptic plasticity in pre-existing pathways and the formation of new circuits through collateral sprouting of lesioned and unlesioned fibres are important components of this recovery process. These reorganization processes might occur in cortical and subcortical motor centres, in the spinal cord below the lesion, and in the spared fibre tracts that connect these centres. Functional and anatomical evidence exists that spontaneous plasticity can be potentiated by activity, as well as by specific experimental manipulations. These studies prepare the way to a better understanding of rehabilitation treatments and to the development of new approaches to treat spinal cord injury.","The development of cortical layers, areas and networks is mediated by a combination of factors that are present in the cortex and are influenced by thalamic input. Electrical activity of thalamocortical afferents has a progressive role in shaping cortex. For early thalamic innervation and patterning, the presence of activity might be sufficient; for features that develop later, such as intracortical networks that mediate emergent responses of cortex, the spatiotemporal pattern of activity often has an instructive role. Experiments that route projections from the retina to the auditory pathway alter the pattern of activity in auditory thalamocortical afferents at a very early stage and reveal the progressive influence of activity on cortical development. Thus, cortical features such as layers and thalamocortical innervation are unaffected, whereas features that develop later, such as intracortical connections, are affected significantly. Surprisingly, the behavioural role of 'rewired' cortex is also influenced profoundly, indicating the importance of patterned activity for this key aspect of cortical function.","Control of nerve-cell excitability is crucial for normal brain function. Two main groups of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors--GABA(A) and glycine receptors--fulfil a significant part of this role. To mediate fast synaptic inhibition effectively, these receptors need to be localized and affixed opposite nerve terminals that release the appropriate neurotransmitter at multiple sites on postsynaptic neurons. But for this to occur, neurons require intracellular anchoring molecules, as well as mechanisms that ensure the efficient turnover and transport of mature, functional inhibitory synaptic receptor proteins. This review describes the dynamic regulation of synaptic GABA(A) and glycine receptors and discusses recent advances in this rapidly evolving field.","The emergence of a unified cognitive moment relies on the coordination of scattered mosaics of functionally specialized brain regions. Here we review the mechanisms of large-scale integration that counterbalance the distributed anatomical and functional organization of brain activity to enable the emergence of coherent behaviour and cognition. Although the mechanisms involved in large-scale integration are still largely unknown, we argue that the most plausible candidate is the formation of dynamic links mediated by synchrony over multiple frequency bands.","Cognitive neuropsychiatry represents a systematic and theoretically driven approach to explain clinical psychopathologies in terms of deficits to normal cognitive mechanisms. A concern with the neural substrates of impaired cognitive mechanisms links cognitive neuropsychiatry to the basic neurosciences. The emergence of cognitive neuropsychiatry in the 1990s illustrates the growing rapprochement between cognitive neuropsychology, clinical medicine and the neurosciences in addressing common questions about disorders of the mind/brain. In reviewing recent applications, we highlight how this hybrid discipline will make a distinctive contribution to the science of psychopathology.","Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are largely known for their involvement in brain development but, as some of these receptor tyrosine kinases are also expressed in adults, their possible role in the mature nervous system has begun to be explored. Evidence for the involvement of Eph receptors in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory is only emerging and needs corroboration. However, it is likely that the actions of Eph kinases in the adult brain will attract significant attention and become a fertile research area, as occurred in the case of the neurotrophins.","Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.","Glial cells are emerging from the background to become more prominent in our thinking about integration in the nervous system. Given that glial cells associated with synapses integrate neuronal inputs and can release transmitters that modulate synaptic activity, it is time to rethink our understanding of the wiring diagram of the nervous system. It is no longer appropriate to consider solely neuron-neuron connections; we also need to develop a view of the intricate web of active connections among glial cells, and between glia and neurons. Without such a view, it might be impossible to decode the language of the brain.","With a bang, a new family of potassium channels has exploded into view. Although KCNK channels were discovered only five years ago, they already outnumber other channel types. KCNK channels are easy to identify because of their unique structure--they possess two preforming domains in each subunit. The new channels function in a most remarkable fashion: they are highly regulated, potassium-selective leak channels. Although leak currents are fundamental to the function of nerves and muscles, the molecular basis for this type of conductance had been a mystery. Here we review the discovery of KCNK channels, what has been learned about them and what lies ahead. Even though two-P-domain channels are widespread and essential, they were hidden from sight in plain view--our most basic questions remain to be answered.","ATP is found in every cell, where it is a major source of energy. But in the nervous system, ATP also has additional actions, which include its role in fast synaptic transmission and modulation. Here I discuss the 'fast' actions of ATP at synapses, the properties of the receptors that are activated by ATP and the physiology of ATP signalling, with emphasis on its role in pain processing.","The control of cell movement during development is essential for forming and stabilizing the spatial organization of tissues and cell types. During initial steps of tissue patterning, distinct regional domains or cell types arise at appropriate locations, and the movement of cells is constrained in order to maintain spatial relationships during growth. In other situations, the guidance of migrating cells or neuronal growth cones to specific destinations underlies the establishment or remodeling of a pattern. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are key players in controlling these cell movements in many tissues and at multiple stages of patterning.","Two organizing centres operate at long-range distances within the anterior neural plate to pattern the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Important progress has been made in understanding the formation and function of one of these organizing centres, the isthmic organizer, which controls the development of the midbrain and anterior hindbrain. Here we review our current knowledge on the identity, localization and maintenance of the isthmic organizer, as well as on the molecular cascades that underlie the activity of this organizing centre.","For three-quarters of a century, developmental biologists have been asking how the nervous system is specified as distinct from the rest of the ectoderm during early development, and how it becomes subdivided initially into distinct regions such as forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. The two events of 'neural induction' and 'early neural patterning' seem to be intertwined, and many models have been put forward to explain how these processes work at a molecular level. Here I consider early neural patterning and discuss the evidence for and against the two most popular models proposed for its explanation: the idea that multiple signalling centres (organizers) are responsible for inducing different regions of the nervous system, and a model first articulated by Nieuwkoop that invokes two steps (activation/transformation) necessary for neural patterning. As recent evidence from several systems challenges both models, I propose a modification of Nieuwkoop's model that most easily accommodates both classical and more recent data, and end by outlining some possible directions for future research.","Pain is necessary for survival, but persistent pain can result in anxiety, depression and a reduction in the quality of life. The discriminative and affective qualities of pain are both thought to be regulated in an activity-dependent fashion. Recent studies have identified cells and molecules that regulate pain sensitivity and the parallel pathways that distribute nociceptive information to limbic or sensory areas of the forebrain. Here, we emphasize the cellular and neurobiological consequences of pain, especially those that are involved in the generation and maintenance of chronic pain. These new insights into pain processing will significantly alter our approach to pain control and the development of new analgesics.", , , , ,"The g factor refers to the substantial overlap that exists between individual differences in diverse cognitive processes in humans. In this article, I argue that a mouse model of g could provide a powerful analytic tool for exploring cognitive processes that are linked functionally by genes.","It is difficult to think of any behavioural process that is more intrinsically important to us than attachment. Feeding, sleeping and locomotion are all necessary for survival, but humans are, as Baruch Spinoza famously noted, ""a social animal"" and it is our social attachments that we live for. Over the past decade, studies in a range of vertebrates, including humans, have begun to address the neural basis of attachment at a molecular, cellular and systems level. This review describes some of the important insights from this work.",Erratum in Nat Rev Neurosci 2001 Mar;2(3):215.,"Postmitotic neurons are produced from a pool of cycling progenitors in an orderly fashion during development. Studies of cell-fate determination in the vertebrate retina have uncovered several fundamental principles by which this is achieved. Most notably, a model for vertebrate cell-fate determination has been proposed that combines findings on the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic regulators in controlling cell-fate choices. At the heart of the model is the proposal that progenitors pass through intrinsically determined competence states, during which they are capable of giving rise to a limited subset of cell types under the influence of extrinsic signals.","Recent evidence indicates that an old memory reactivated by cueing becomes labile and vulnerable to an amnesic treatment. Although the 'reconsolidation' concept derived from these findings challenges the traditional consolidation theory, here we argue that the new concept suffers from some of the same limitations as the earlier model. We propose an alternative retrieval-based theory that accommodates the recent data, as well as other puzzling related observations.","Questions about brain function and disease are being addressed with parallel genomic approaches. High-density DNA arrays make it possible to monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes at a time, and are being used to address old questions in new ways and to generate new hypotheses about the workings of the brain.","The hallmark of medial temporal lobe amnesia is a loss of episodic memory such that patients fail to remember new events that are set in an autobiographical context (an episode). A further symptom is a loss of recognition memory. The relationship between these two features has recently become contentious. Here, we focus on the central issue in this dispute--the relative contributions of the hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex to recognition memory. A resolution is vital not only for uncovering the neural substrates of these key aspects of memory, but also for understanding the processes disrupted in medial temporal lobe amnesia and the validity of animal models of this syndrome.",Splicing of pre-messenger RNA is regulated differently in the brain compared with other tissues. Recognition of aberrations in splicing events that are associated with neurological disease has contributed to our understanding of disease pathogenesis in some cases. Neuron-specific proteins involved in RNA splicing and metabolism are also affected in several neurological disorders. These findings have begun to bridge what we know about the mechanisms regulating neuron-specific splicing and our understanding of neural function and disease.,"The ability and opportunity to make decisions and carry out effective actions in pursuit of goals is central to intelligent life. Recent research has provided significant new insights into how the brain arrives at decisions, makes choices, and produces and evaluates the consequences of actions. In fact, by monitoring or manipulating specific neurons, certain choices can now be predicted or manipulated.","The role of neurotrophins as regulatory factors that mediate the differentiation and survival of neurons has been well described. More recent evidence indicates that neurotrophins may also act as synaptic modulators. Here, I review the evidence that synaptic activity regulates the synthesis, secretion and action of neurotrophins, which can in turn induce immediate changes in synaptic efficacy and morphology. By this account, neurotrophins may participate in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, linking synaptic activity with long-term functional and structural modification of synaptic connections.","Local-circuit, gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus and cortex have traditionally been considered as the regulators of principal neuron activity--the yin to the excitatory yang. Recent evidence indicates that, in addition to that role, their network connectivity and the properties of their intrinsic voltage-gated currents are finely tuned to permit inhibitory interneurons to generate and control the rhythmic output of large populations of both principal cells and other populations of inhibitory interneurons. This review brings together recently described properties and emerging principles of interneuron function that indicate a much more complex role for these cells than just providers of inhibition.","'Consolidation' has been used to describe distinct but related processes. In considering the implications of our recent findings on the lability of reactivated fear memories, we view consolidation and reconsolidation in terms of molecular events taking place within neurons as opposed to interactions between brain regions. Our findings open up a new dimension in the study of memory consolidation. We argue that consolidation is not a one-time event, but instead is reiterated with subsequent activation of the memories.","The observation that retrieval returns a stable memory into a labile state cannot be readily explained by any simple version of consolidation theory. This finding has been interpreted as evidence for the need to reconsolidate a memory after reactivating it. However, as we discuss in this commentary, other behavioural observations indicate that even this modification to consolidation theory may be insufficient to describe the dynamic properties of memory.",DOI: 10.1038/35044575 PMID: 11257910  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1038/35044572 PMID: 11257909  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],The fundamental biological importance of rewards has created an increasing interest in the neuronal processing of reward information. The suggestion that the mechanisms underlying drug addiction might involve natural reward systems has also stimulated interest. This article focuses on recent neurophysiological studies in primates that have revealed that neurons in a limited number of brain structures carry specific signals about past and future rewards. This research provides the first step towards an understanding of how rewards influence behaviour before they are received and how the brain might use reward information to control learning and goal-directed behaviour.,"Neuronal plasticity is a central theme of modern neurobiology, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of synapse formation in Drosophila to behavioural recovery from strokes in elderly humans. Although the methods used to measure plastic responses differ, the stimuli required to elicit plasticity are thought to be activity-dependent. In this article, we focus on the neuronal changes that occur in response to complex stimulation by an enriched environment. We emphasize the behavioural and neurobiological consequences of specific elements of enrichment, especially exercise and learning.","A fundamental function of nerve cells is the transformation of incoming synaptic information into specific patterns of action potential output. An important component of this transformation is synaptic integration--the combination of voltage deflections produced by a myriad of synaptic inputs into a singular change in membrane potential. There are three basic elements involved in integration: the amplitude of the unitary postsynaptic potential; the manner in which non-simultaneous unitary events add in time (temporal summation), and the addition of unitary events occurring simultaneously in separate regions of the dendritic arbor (spatial summation). This review discusses how passive and active dendritic properties, and the functional characteristics of the synapse, shape these three elements of synaptic integration.","The Rho family of small GTPases act as intracellular molecular switches that transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to the actin cytoskeleton and the nucleus. Recent evidence implicates Rho GTPases in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis, including migration, polarity, axon growth and guidance, dendrite elaboration and plasticity, and synapse formation. Signalling pathways from membrane receptors to Rho GTPases and from Rho GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton are beginning to be discovered. Mutations in these signalling pathways have been reported in human neurological diseases, which underscores their importance in the development and function of the nervous system.","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a special form of vesicle budding important for the internalization of receptors and extracellular ligands, for the recycling of plasma membrane components, and for the retrieval of surface proteins destined for degradation. In nerve terminals, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is crucial for synaptic vesicle recycling. Recent structural studies have provided molecular details of coat assembly. In addition, biochemical and genetic studies have identified numerous accessory proteins that assist the clathrin coat in its function at synapses and in other systems. This review summarizes these advances with a special focus on accessory factors and highlights new aspects of clathrin-mediated endocytosis revealed by the study of these factors.", , , , , , ,"We are not passive recipients of the information that impinges on our retinae, but active participants in our own perceptual processes. Visual experience depends critically on attention. We select particular aspects of a visual scene for detailed analysis and control of subsequent behaviour, but ignore other aspects so completely that moments after they disappear from view we cannot report anything about them. Here we show that functional neuroimaging is revealing much more than where attention happens in the brain; it is beginning to answer some of the oldest and deepest questions about what visual attention is and how it works.","Psychophysical and physiological studies have shown that attending to a stimulus can enhance its sensory processing. Functional imaging studies now reveal that attention can also modulate activity in sensory brain areas before stimulus onset, when the observer prepares to attend to an anticipated stimulus. These preparatory 'baseline shifts' in brain activity pose many new questions, and potentially offer new insights into the neural basis of perceptual awareness.","The spectacularly successful race over the past three years to place our understanding of the circadian clockwork of mammals into a molecular framework is beginning to yield the cardinal example of the molecular-genetic control of behaviour. This perspective describes recent evidence for the conservation of a double-loop, autoregulatory feedback mechanism across the best understood eukaryotic circadian systems, and discusses how these findings may illuminate some long-standing puzzles concerning our subliminal sense of circadian time.","Dynamic regulation of synaptic efficacy is one of the mechanisms thought to underlie learning and memory. Many of the observed changes in efficacy, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, result from the functional alteration of excitatory neurotransmission mediated by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. These changes may result from the modulation of the receptors themselves and from regulation of protein networks associated with glutamate receptors. Understanding the interactions in this synaptic complex will yield invaluable insight into the molecular basis of synaptic function. This review focuses on the molecular organization of excitatory synapses and the processes involved in the dynamic regulation of glutamate receptors.","Information is encoded in the brain by populations or clusters of cells, rather than by single cells. This encoding strategy is known as population coding. Here we review the standard use of population codes for encoding and decoding information, and consider how population codes can be used to support neural computations such as noise removal and nonlinear mapping. More radical ideas about how population codes may directly represent information about stimulus uncertainty are also discussed.","Understanding the patterning mechanisms that control head development--particularly the neural crest and its contribution to bones, nerves and connective tissue--is an important problem, as craniofacial anomalies account for one-third of all human congenital defects. Classical models for craniofacial patterning argue that the morphogenic program and Hox gene identity of the neural crest is pre-patterned, carrying positional information acquired in the hindbrain to the peripheral nervous system and the branchial arches. Recently, however, plasticity of Hox gene expression has been observed in the hindbrain and cranial neural crest of chick, mouse and zebrafish embryos. Hence, craniofacial development is not dependent on neural crest prepatterning, but is regulated by a more complex integration of cell and tissue interactions.","Two decades ago, molecular genetic analysis provided a new approach for defining the roots of inherited disorders. This strategy has proved particularly powerful because, with only a description of the inheritance pattern, it can uncover previously unsuspected mechanisms of pathogenesis that are not implicated by known biological pathways or by the disease manifestations. Nowhere has the impact of molecular genetics been more evident than in the dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders, where eight unrelated diseases have been revealed to possess the same type of mutation--an expanded polyglutamine encoding sequence--affecting different genes.","The production and control of complex motor functions are usually attributed to central brain structures such as cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum. In traditional schemes the spinal cord is assigned a subservient function during the production of movement, playing a predominantly passive role by relaying the commands dictated to it by supraspinal systems. This review challenges this idea by presenting evidence that the spinal motor system is an active participant in several aspects of the production of movement, contributing to functions normally ascribed to 'higher' brain regions.",Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used to investigate almost all areas of cognitive neuroscience. This article discusses the most important (and least understood) considerations regarding the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation for cognitive neuroscience and outlines advances in the use of this technique for the replication and extension of findings from neuropsychology. We also take a more speculative look forward to the emerging development of strategies for combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with other brain imaging technologies and methods in the cognitive neurosciences.,"For over 100 years a central assumption in the field of neuroscience has been that new neurons are not added to the adult mammalian brain. This perspective examines the origins of this dogma, its perseverance in the face of contradictory evidence, and its final collapse. The acceptance of adult neurogenesis may be part of a contemporary paradigm shift in our view of the plasticity and stability of the adult brain.",One of the enduring mysteries of brain function concerns the process of cognitive control. How does complex and seemingly willful behaviour emerge from interactions between millions of neurons? This has long been suspected to depend on the prefrontal cortex--the neocortex at the anterior end of the brain--but now we are beginning to uncover its neural basis. Nearly all intended behaviour is learned and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the 'rules of the game' needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation. Studies indicate that the prefrontal cortex is central in this process. It provides an infrastructure for synthesizing a diverse range of information that lays the foundation for the complex forms of behaviour observed in primates.,"Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts an increasing part of our ageing population. An isoform of apolipoprotein E, a protein that mediates the transport of lipids and cholesterol in the circulatory system, predisposes carriers of this allele to the common late-onset form of the disease. How this protein is related to a neurodegenerative disorder is an enigma. Mounting evidence indicates that apolipoprotein E receptors, which are abundantly expressed in most neurons in the central nervous system, also fulfill critical functions during brain development and may profoundly influence the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.","Recent neurobiological studies have begun to reveal the cognitive and neural coding mechanisms that underlie declarative memory--our ability to recollect everyday events and factual knowledge. These studies indicate that the critical circuitry involves bidirectional connections between the neocortex, the parahippocampal region and the hippocampus. Each of these areas makes a unique contribution to memory processing. Widespread high-order neocortical areas provide dedicated processors for perceptual, motor or cognitive information that is influenced by other components of the system. The parahippocampal region mediates convergence of this information and extends the persistence of neocortical memory representations. The hippocampus encodes the sequences of places and events that compose episodic memories, and links them together through their common elements. Here I describe how these mechanisms work together to create and re-create fully networked representations of previous experiences and knowledge about the world.","Songbirds are one of the best-studied examples of vocal learners. Learning of both human speech and birdsong depends on hearing. Once learned, adult song in many species remains unchanging, suggesting a reduced influence of sensory experience. Recent studies have revealed, however, that adult song is not always stable, extending our understanding of the mechanisms involved in song maintenance, and their similarity to those active during song learning. Here we review some of the processes that contribute to song learning and production, with an emphasis on the role of auditory feedback. We then consider some of the possible neural substrates involved in these processes, particularly basal ganglia circuitry. Although a thorough treatment of human speech is beyond the scope of this article, we point out similarities between speech and song learning, and ways in which studies of these disparate behaviours complement each other in developing an understanding of general principles that contribute to learning and maintenance of vocal behaviour.","Humans have over 70 potassium channel genes, but only some of these have been linked to disease. In this respect, the KCNQ family of potassium channels is exceptional: mutations in four out of five KCNQ genes underlie diseases including cardiac arrhythmias, deafness and epilepsy. These disorders illustrate the different physiological functions of KCNQ channels, and provide a model for the study of the 'safety margin' that separates normal from pathological levels of channel expression. In addition, several KCNQ isoforms can associate to form heteromeric channels that underlie the M-current, an important regulator of neuronal excitability.","In 1894, Ramón y Cajal first proposed that memory is stored as an anatomical change in the strength of neuronal connections. For the following 60 years, little evidence was recruited in support of this idea. This situation changed in the middle of the twentieth century with the development of cellular techniques for the study of synaptic connections and the emergence of new formulations of synaptic plasticity that redefined Ramón y Cajal's idea, making it more suitable for testing. These formulations defined two categories of plasticity, referred to as homosynaptic or Hebbian activity-dependent, and heterosynaptic or modulatory input-dependent. Here we suggest that Hebbian mechanisms are used primarily for learning and for short-term memory but often cannot, by themselves, recruit the events required to maintain a long-term memory. In contrast, heterosynaptic plasticity commonly recruits long-term memory mechanisms that lead to transcription and to synpatic growth. When jointly recruited, homosynaptic mechanisms assure that learning is effectively established and heterosynaptic mechanisms ensure that memory is maintained."
