"Research over the last few years in cellular reprogramming has enlightened the magical potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) in changing the cell fate from somatic to pluripotent. Recent investigations on exploring the role(s) of miRNAs in somatic cell reprogramming revealed that they target a wide range of molecules and refine their protein output. This leads to fine tuning of distinct cellular processes including cell cycle, signalling pathways, transcriptional activation/silencing and epigenetic modelling. The concerted actions of miRNA on different pathways simultaneously strengthen the transition from a differentiated to de-differentiated state. Despite the well characterized transcriptional and epigenetic machinery underlying somatic cell reprogramming, the molecular circuitry for miRNA mediated cellular reprogramming is rather fragmented. This review summarizes recent findings addressing the role of miRNAs in inducing or suppressing reprogramming thus uncovering novel potentials of miRNAs as regulators of induced pluripotency maintenance, establishment and associated signalling pathways. Our bioinformatic analysis sheds light on various unexplored biological processes and pathways associated with reprogramming inducing miRNAs, thus helps in identifying roadblocks to full reprogramming. Specifically, the biological significance of highly conserved and most studied miRNA cluster, i.e. miR-302-367, in reprogramming is also highlighted. Further, roles of miRNAs in the differentiation of neurons from iPSCs are discussed. A recent approach of direct conversion or transdifferentiation of differentiated cells into neurons by miRNAs is also elaborated. This approach is now widely gaining impetus for the generation of neurological patient's brain cells directly from his/her somatic cells in an efficient and safe manner. Thus, decoding the intricate circuitry between miRNAs and other gene regulatory networks will not only uncover novel pathways in the direct reprogramming of somatic cells but will also open new avenues in stem cell biology.","Melanocortin peptides induce neuroprotection in acute and chronic experimental neurodegenerative conditions. Melanocortins likewise counteract systemic responses to brain injuries. Furthermore, they promote neurogenesis by activating critical signaling pathways. Melanocortin-induced long-lasting improvement in synaptic activity and neurological performance, including learning and memory, sensory-motor orientation and coordinated limb use, has been consistently observed in experimental models of acute and chronic neurodegeneration. Evidence indicates that the neuroprotective and neurogenic effects of melanocortins, as well as the protection against systemic responses to a brain injury, are mediated by brain melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptors, through an involvement of the vagus nerve. Here we discuss the targets and mechanisms underlying the multiple beneficial effects recently observed in animal models of neurodegeneration. We comment on the potential clinical usefulness of melanocortin MC4 receptor agonists as neuroprotective and neuroregenerative agents in ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease.","Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the overproduction and incorporation of free radicals and the dynamic ability of a biosystem to detoxify reactive intermediates. Free radicals produced by oxidative stress are one of the common features in several experimental models of diseases. Free radicals affect both the structure and function of neural cells, and contribute to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although the precise mechanisms that result in the degeneration of neurons and the relevant pathological changes remain unclear, the crucial role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is associated with several proteins (such as α-synuclein, DJ-1, Amyloid β and tau protein) and some signaling pathways (such as extracellular regulated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) that are tightly associated with the neural damage. In this review, we present evidence, gathered over the last decade, concerning a variety of pathogenic proteins, their important signaling pathways and pathogenic mechanisms associated with oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Proper control and regulation of these proteins' functions and the related signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic approach to the patients. We also emphasizes antioxidative options, including some new neuroprotective agents that eliminate excess reactive oxygen species efficiently and have a certain therapeutic effect; however, controversy surrounds some of them in terms of the dose and length of therapy. These agents require further investigation by clinical application in patients suffering Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2016.08.004 PMID: 27609181  [PubMed - in process],"Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) occur in psychotic disorders, but also as a symptom of other conditions and even in healthy people. Several current theories on the origin of AVH converge, with neuroimaging studies suggesting that the language, auditory and memory/limbic networks are of particular relevance. However, reconciliation of these theories with experimental evidence is missing. We review 50 studies investigating functional (EEG and fMRI) and anatomic (diffusion tensor imaging) connectivity in these networks, and explore the evidence supporting abnormal connectivity in these networks associated with AVH. We distinguish between functional connectivity during an actual hallucination experience (symptom capture) and functional connectivity during either the resting state or a task comparing individuals who hallucinate with those who do not (symptom association studies). Symptom capture studies clearly reveal a pattern of increased coupling among the auditory, language and striatal regions. Anatomical and symptom association functional studies suggest that the interhemispheric connectivity between posterior auditory regions may depend on the phase of illness, with increases in non-psychotic individuals and first episode patients and decreases in chronic patients. Leading hypotheses involving concepts as unstable memories, source monitoring, top-down attention, and hybrid models of hallucinations are supported in part by the published connectivity data, although several caveats and inconsistencies remain. Specifically, possible changes in fronto-temporal connectivity are still under debate. Precise hypotheses concerning the directionality of connections deduced from current theoretical approaches should be tested using experimental approaches that allow for discrimination of competing hypotheses.","The post-genomic era has unveiled the existence of a large repertory of non-coding RNAs and repetitive elements that play a fundamental role in cellular homeostasis and dysfunction. These may represent unprecedented opportunities to modify gene expression at the right time in the correct space in vivo, providing an almost unlimited reservoir of new potential pharmacological agents. Hijacking their mode of actions, the druggable genome can be extended to regulatory RNAs and DNA elements in a scalable fashion. Here, we discuss the state-of-the-art of nucleic acid-based drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Beneficial effects can be obtained by inhibiting (Yin) and increasing (Yang) gene expression, depending on the disease and the drug target. Together with the description of the current use of inhibitory RNAs (small inhibitory RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides) in animal models and clinical trials, we discuss the molecular basis and applications of new classes of activatory RNAs at transcriptional (RNAa) and translational (SINEUP) levels.","Approximately 1 in 5000-8000 children are born annually with a lysosomal storage disease (LSD), which affects their cells' ability to break down naturally occurring substrates. Accumulation, or ""storage,"" of undegraded substrates leads to a wide variety of clinical symptoms, and early mortality. Currently, for LSDs with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, there is no available treatment. Four methods of treatment are being explored in clinical trials and preclinical settings: enzyme replacement therapy, ex vivo gene therapy, in vivo gene therapy, and nanoparticle-based therapy. In general, each therapeutic approach has been hindered by an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) without invasive intracranial surgeries. Also, once the treatment has entered the brain, it is difficult to ensure therapeutic levels of enzyme distributed evenly throughout the entire parenchyma. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the current standard of care for lysosomal diseases without CNS involvement. However, with the recent advent of nanoparticle-based therapy, direct targeting of either gene therapy or ERT to the brain has become plausible. Ex vivo gene therapy, in vivo gene therapy, ERT and nanoparticle-based therapies are explained, while synthesizing and analyzing their potential as clinical treatments targeted to the CNS. While difficulties in treating the entire brain remain, preclinical studies demonstrate profound therapeutic benefit in animal models and generate hope for successful translation to humans.","There is growing evidence that patients with Type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease and share similar dysregulated pathways suggesting common underlying pathological mechanisms. Historically insulin was thought solely to be a peripherally acting hormone responsible for glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. However accumulating evidence indicates insulin can cross the blood-brain-barrier and influence a multitude of processes in the brain including regulating neuronal survival and growth, dopaminergic transmission, maintenance of synapses and pathways involved in cognition. In conjunction, there is growing evidence that a process analogous to peripheral insulin resistance occurs in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients, even in those without diabetes. This raises the possibility that defective insulin signalling pathways may contribute to the development of the pathological features of Parkinson's disease, and thereby suggests that the insulin signalling pathway may potentially be a novel target for disease modification. Given these growing links between PD and Type 2 diabetes it is perhaps not unsurprising that drugs used the treatment of T2DM are amongst the most promising treatments currently being prioritised for repositioning as possible novel treatments for PD and several clinical trials are under way. In this review, we will examine the underlying cellular links between insulin resistance and the pathogenesis of PD and then we will assess current and future pharmacological strategies being developed to restore neuronal insulin signalling as a potential strategy for slowing neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a common motor neuron disease affecting two per 100,000 people worldwide, encompasses at least five distinct pathological subtypes, including, ALS-SOD1, ALS-C9orf72, ALS-TDP-43, ALS-FUS and Guam-ALS. The etiology of a major subset of ALS involves toxicity of the TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43). A second RNA/DNA binding protein, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) has been subsequently associated with about 1% of ALS patients. While mutations in TDP-43 and FUS have been linked to ALS, the key contributing molecular mechanism(s) leading to cell death are still unclear. One unique feature of TDP-43 and FUS pathogenesis in ALS is their nuclear clearance and simultaneous cytoplasmic aggregation in affected motor neurons. Since the discoveries in the last decade implicating TDP-43 and FUS toxicity in ALS, a majority of studies have focused on their cytoplasmic aggregation and disruption of their RNA-binding functions. However, TDP-43 and FUS also bind to DNA, although the significance of their DNA binding in disease-affected neurons has been less investigated. A recent observation of accumulated genomic damage in TDP-43 and FUS-linked ALS and association of FUS with neuronal DNA damage repair pathways indicate a possible role of deregulated DNA binding function of TDP-43 and FUS in ALS. In this review, we discuss the different ALS disease subtypes, crosstalk of etiopathologies in disease progression, available animal models and their limitations, and recent advances in understanding the specific involvement of RNA/DNA binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, in motor neuron diseases.","This review surveys the efforts taken to achieve clinically efficacious protection of the ischemic brain and underscores the necessity of expanding our purview to include the essential role of cerebral perfusion and the collateral circulation. We consider the development of quantitative strategies to measure cerebral perfusion at the regional and local levels and the application of these methods to elucidate flow-related thresholds of ischemic viability and to characterize the ischemic penumbra. We stress that the modern concept of neuroprotection must consider perfusion, the necessary substrate upon which ischemic brain survival depends. We survey the major mechanistic approaches to neuroprotection and review clinical neuroprotection trials, focusing on those phase 3 multicenter clinical trials for acute ischemic stroke that have been completed or terminated. We review the evolution of thrombolytic therapies; consider the lessons learned from the initial, negative multicenter trials of endovascular therapy; and emphasize the highly successful positive trials that have finally established a clinical role for endovascular clot removal. As these studies point to the brain's collateral circulation as key to successful reperfusion, we next review the anatomy and pathophysiology of collateral perfusion as it relates to ischemic infarction, as well as the molecular and genetic influences on collateral development. We discuss the current MR and CT-based diagnostic methods for assessing the collateral circulation and the prognostic significance of collaterals in ischemic stroke, and we consider past and possible future therapeutic directions.","Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a variety of symptoms that include sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social changes. The exact neuronal mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unclear though. Neuroimaging has focused mainly on the brain's extrinsic activity, specifically task-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, as related to the sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social functions. Recently, the focus has shifted to the brain's spontaneous activity, otherwise known as its resting state activity. While various spatial and temporal abnormalities have been observed in spontaneous activity in schizophrenia, their meaning and significance for the different psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenia, are yet to be defined. The first aim in this paper is to provide an overview of recent findings concerning changes in the spatial (e.g., functional connectivity) and temporal (e.g., couplings between different frequency fluctuations) properties of spontaneous activity in schizophrenia. The second aim is to link these spatiotemporal changes to the various psychopathological symptoms of schizophrenia, with a specific focus on basic symptoms, formal thought disorder, and ego-disturbances. Based on the various findings described, we postulate that the spatiotemporal changes on the neuronal level of the brain's spontaneous activity transform into corresponding spatiotemporal changes on the psychological level which, in turn, leads to the different kinds of psychopathological symptoms. We consequently suggest a spatiotemporal rather than cognitive or sensory approach to the condition, amounting to what we describe as ""Spatiotemporal Psychopathology"".","Cognitive neuroscientists in the late 20th century began the task of identifying the part(s) of the brain concerned with normal behavior as manifest in the psychological capacities as affective powers, reasoning, behaving purposively and the pursuit of goals, following introduction of the 'functional magnetic resonance imaging' (fMRI) method for identifying brain activity. For this research program to be successful two questions require satisfactory answers. First, as the fMRI method can currently only be used on stationary subjects, to what extent can neuropsychological tests applicable to such stationary subjects be correlated with normal behavior. Second, to what extent can correlations between the various neuropsychological tests on the one hand, and sites of brain activity determined with fMRI on the other, be regarded as established. The extent to which these questions have yet received satisfactory answers is reviewed, and suggestions made both for improving correlations of neuropsychological tests with behavior as well as with the results of fMRI-based observations.","Monoamines are key neuromodulators involved in a variety of physiological and pathological brain functions. Classical studies using physiological and pharmacological tools have revealed several essential aspects of monoaminergic involvement in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and influencing sensory responses but many features have remained elusive due to technical limitations. The application of optogenetic tools led to the ability of monitoring and controlling neuronal populations with unprecedented temporal precision and neurochemical specificity. Here, we focus on recent advances in revealing the roles of some monoamines in brain state control and sensory information processing. We summarize the central position of monoamines in integrating sensory processing across sleep-wake states with an emphasis on research conducted using optogenetic techniques. Finally, we discuss the limitations and perspectives of new integrated experimental approaches in understanding the modulatory mechanisms of monoaminergic systems in the mammalian brain.","In the brain, the astrocentric view has increasingly changed in the past few years. The classical and old view of astrocytes as ""just supporting cells"" has assigned these cells some functions to help neurons maintain their homeostasis. This neuronal supportive function of astrocytes includes maintenance of ion and extracellular pH equilibrium, neuroendocrine signaling, metabolic support, clearance of glutamate and other neurotransmitters, and antioxidant protection. However, recent findings have shed some light on the new roles, some controversial though, performed by astrocytes that might change our view about the central nervous system functioning. Since astrocytes are important for neuronal survival, it is a potential approach to favor astrocytic functions in order to improve the outcome. Such translational strategies may include the use of genetically targeted proteins, and/or pharmacological therapies by administering androgens and estrogens, which have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo models. It is noteworthy that successful strategies reviewed in here shall be extrapolated to human subjects, and this is probably the next step we should move on.","Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a member of the secreted lipocalin protein family. LCN2 is also a representative gliocalin that is primarily released by glial cells, as well as acts upon them. Astrocytes are one of the major cellular sources of LCN2 under brain injury conditions. Astrocytes secrete LCN2 to promote neuroinflammation. Studies using Lcn2 knockout animals and cultured neural cells suggest an important role of LCN2 in regulating the development of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke as well as other brain injuries. The clinical relevance of LCN2 is supported by studies on patients with stroke. Mechanistic studies have revealed that LCN2 is a molecular switch for determining the phenotypic fate of astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. LCN2 gene expression is regulated at the multiple levels; mostly at the transcription level, post-transcription level by microRNAs, and protein level by minor post-translational modification. Recent advances in LCN2 research strongly indicate that astrocytic LCN2 is a promising drug target for the injured brain. Future research should focus on its translational aspects, such as developing small-molecule inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies to target LCN2 for the treatment of brain injury. However, spatiotemporally complex roles of LCN2, which are either beneficial or deleterious, should be considered when targeting LCN2. The potential use of LCN2 as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of various brain disorders is also discussed.","In the last years there has been a considerable advance in the knowledge on the regulation of astrocytes by sex steroids under physiological and pathological conditions. By the activation of a variety of nuclear and membrane receptors, sex steroid hormones regulate the functions of astrocytes and their communication with other cell types in the central nervous system. Under physiological conditions astrocytes participate in the neuroendocrine and behavioral actions of gonadal steroids, as well as in the hormonal control of brain tissue homeostasis. Under pathological conditions astrocytes mediate, at least partially, the neuroprotective effects of gonadal steroid hormones; given that sex steroids modulate reactive astrogliosis and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory molecules by these cells. Given the side effects that sex steroids may have when administered systemically, a number of synthetic agonists of the receptors for gonadal steroid hormones in the nervous system have been developed, and may be considered for clinical use after brain injury as potential enhancers of the neuroprotective astrocytic functions.","In the normal central nervous system, endothelin-1 (ET-1) is found in some types of neurons, epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of microvessels, but it is usually not detectable in glial cells. However, in different pathological conditions, astrocytes adapting a reactive phenotype express high levels of ET-1 and its receptors, mainly the ETB receptor. ET-1 released by reactive astrocytes appears mainly to have neurodeleterious effects by mechanisms that include constriction of cerebral arterioles leading to impairment of the cerebral microcirculation, increase of blood brain barrier permeability, inflammation, excitotoxicity, impairment of fast axonal transport, and astrogliosis. A few studies in rodents found that ET-1 increased the astrocytic expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor and neurotropin-3, and the production of endocannabinoids. However, whether this occurs in physiological or pathological conditions is unclear. This review summarizes current knowledge about the role of the astrocytic ET-1 system in acute and chronic neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke and hypoxic/ischemic brain injury, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, Alzheimer's disease, Binswanger's disease and post-stroke dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and CNS infections. Counteracting the harmful effects of astrocytic ET-1 may represent a promising therapeutic target for mitigating secondary brain damage in a variety of neurological diseases. We also briefly address the role of astrocytic ET-1 in astrocytic tumors and pain.","Stroke and traumatic injuries of the brain and spinal cord are major public health issues. In the last few decades, hundreds of clinical trials with patients suffering from these conditions have been done, however, most of them had not succeeded and there is still the need to develop more effective treatments for these conditions. Astrocytes play critical roles in the development, function and survival of neurons in the central nervous system. These cells are implicated in the pathophysiology and in the response to several neuropathological conditions and may represent potential cell targets for neuroprotective strategies. Progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are neuroactive steroids that modulate neuronal and astroglial function and have neuroprotective effects in different experimental models, being potential candidates to the development of new therapeutic approaches for brain and spinal cord injuries. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of brain and spinal cord injuries and how they could be modulated by progesterone and DHEA for the treatment of these conditions.","Astrocytes are a major constituent of the central nervous system. These glia play a major role in regulating blood-brain barrier function, the formation and maintenance of synapses, glutamate uptake, and trophic support for surrounding neurons and glia. Therefore, maintaining the proper functioning of these cells is crucial to survival. Astrocyte defects are associated with a wide variety of neuropathological insults, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases to gliomas. Additionally, injury to the CNS causes drastic changes to astrocytes, often leading to a phenomenon known as reactive astrogliosis. This process is important for protecting the surrounding healthy tissue from the spread of injury, while it also inhibits axonal regeneration and plasticity. Here, we discuss the important roles of astrocytes after injury and in disease, as well as potential therapeutic approaches to restore proper astrocyte functioning.","The hypothalamus is crucial in the regulation of homeostatic functions in mammals, with the disruption of hypothalamic circuits contributing to chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and infertility. Metabolic signals and hormonal inputs drive functional and morphological changes in the hypothalamus in attempt to maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, the dramatic increase in the incidence of obesity and its secondary complications, such as type 2 diabetes, have evidenced the need to better understand how this system functions and how it can go awry. Growing evidence points to a critical role of astrocytes in orchestrating the hypothalamic response to metabolic cues by participating in processes of synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and nutrient sensing. These glial cells express receptors for important metabolic signals, such as the anorexigenic hormone leptin, and determine the type and quantity of nutrients reaching their neighboring neurons. Understanding the mechanisms by which astrocytes participate in hypothalamic adaptations to changes in dietary and metabolic signals is fundamental for understanding the neuroendocrine control of metabolism and key in the search for adequate treatments of metabolic diseases.","Astrocytes are now viewed as key elements of brain wiring as well as neuronal communication. Indeed, they not only bridge the gap between metabolic supplies by blood vessels and neurons, but also allow fine control of neurotransmission by providing appropriate signaling molecules and insulation through a tight enwrapping of synapses. Recognition that astroglia is essential to neuronal communication is nevertheless fairly recent and the large body of evidence dissecting such role has focused on the synaptic level by identifying neuro- and gliotransmitters uptaken and released at synaptic or extrasynaptic sites. Yet, more integrated research deciphering the impact of astroglial functions on neuronal network activity have led to the reasonable assumption that the role of astrocytes in supervising synaptic activity translates in influencing neuronal processing and cognitive functions. Several investigations using recent genetic tools now support this notion by showing that inactivating or boosting astroglial function directly affects cognitive abilities. Accordingly, brain diseases resulting in impaired cognitive functions have seen their physiopathological mechanisms revisited in light of this primary protagonist of brain processing. We here provide a review of the current knowledge on the role of astrocytes in cognition and in several brain diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric illnesses, as well as other conditions such as epilepsy. Potential astroglial therapeutic targets are also discussed.","Evidence so far indicates that therapies targeting a single aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have no sufficient efficacy in diminishing long-term the progression of AD. Neuroinflammation is an early event during the development of the disease and it is thought to exacerbate the abnormal aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and the microtubule associated protein Tau. Inhibition of gliosis is considered fundamental to reduce neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and synaptic dysfunction driving the progression of AD. Drugs that are able to target more than one aspect of the pathology may have higher chances of success. Modulators of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) such as nicotine and some of its derivatives have this potential because of their anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, pro-cognitive and anti-protein aggregation effects. However, the rapid desensitization of α7nAChRs is considered an important factor limiting its potential therapeutic use. In here, in light of current evidence, the objective of this review is to discuss the advantages and potential therapeutic value of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the nAChRs in halting or delaying the progression of AD by diminishing neuroinflammation, abnormal protein aggregation and synaptic dysfunction.","Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and begins with a subtle decline in episodic memory followed by a more general decline in overall cognitive abilities. Though the exact trigger for this cascade of events remains unknown the presence of the misfolded amyloid-beta protein triggers reactive gliosis, a prominent neuropathological feature in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The cytoskeletal and morphological changes of astrogliosis are its evident features, while changes in oxidative stress defense, cholesterol metabolism, and gene transcription programs are less manifest. However, these latter molecular changes may underlie a disruption in homeostatic regulation that keeps the brain environment balanced. Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease show changes in glutamate and GABA signaling and recycling, potassium buffering, and in cholinergic, purinergic, and calcium signaling. Ultimately the dysregulation of homeostasis maintained by astrocytes can have grave consequences for the stability of microcircuits within key brain regions. Specifically, altered inhibition influenced by astrocytes can lead to local circuit imbalance with farther reaching consequences for the functioning of larger neuronal networks. Healthy astrocytes have a role in maintaining and modulating normal neuronal communication, synaptic physiology and energy metabolism, astrogliosis interferes with these functions. This review considers the molecular and functional changes occurring during astrogliosis in Alzheimer's disease, and proposes that astrocytes are key players in the development of dementia.","Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the central nervous system. They play essential roles in maintaining normal brain function, as they are a critical structural and functional part of the tripartite synapses and the neurovascular unit, and communicate with neurons, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells. After an ischemic stroke, astrocytes perform multiple functions both detrimental and beneficial, for neuronal survival during the acute phase. Aspects of the astrocytic inflammatory response to stroke may aggravate the ischemic lesion, but astrocytes also provide benefit for neuroprotection, by limiting lesion extension via anti-excitotoxicity effects and releasing neurotrophins. Similarly, during the late recovery phase after stroke, the glial scar may obstruct axonal regeneration and subsequently reduce the functional outcome; however, astrocytes also contribute to angiogenesis, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and axonal remodeling, and thereby promote neurological recovery. Thus, the pivotal involvement of astrocytes in normal brain function and responses to an ischemic lesion designates them as excellent therapeutic targets to improve functional outcome following stroke. In this review, we will focus on functions of astrocytes and astrocyte-mediated events during stroke and recovery. We will provide an overview of approaches on how to reduce the detrimental effects and amplify the beneficial effects of astrocytes on neuroprotection and on neurorestoration post stroke, which may lead to novel and clinically relevant therapies for stroke.","Fundamentally, all brain disorders can be broadly defined as the homeostatic failure of this organ. As the brain is composed of many different cells types, including but not limited to neurons and glia, it is only logical that all the cell types/constituents could play a role in health and disease. Yet, for a long time the sole conceptualization of brain pathology was focused on the well-being of neurons. Here, we challenge this neuron-centric view and present neuroglia as a key element in neuropathology, a process that has a toll on astrocytes, which undergo complex morpho-functional changes that can in turn affect the course of the disorder. Such changes can be grossly identified as reactivity, atrophy with loss of function and pathological remodeling. We outline the pathogenic potential of astrocytes in variety of disorders, ranging from neurotrauma, infection, toxic damage, stroke, epilepsy, neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, Alexander disease to neoplastic changes seen in gliomas. We hope that in near future we would witness glial-based translational medicine with generation of deliverables for the containment and cure of disorders. We point out that such as a task will require a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach that will take in consideration the concerted operation of all the cell types in the brain.","Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of ubiquitous extracellular endopeptidases, which play important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, from the embryonic stages throughout adult life. Their extraordinary physiological ""success"" is due to concomitant broad substrate specificities and strict regulation of their expression, activation and inhibition levels. In recent years, MMPs have gained increasing attention as significant effectors in various aspects of central nervous system (CNS) physiology. Most importantly, they have been recognized as main players in a variety of brain disorders having different etiologies and evolution. A common aspect of these pathologies is the development of acute or chronic neuroinflammation. MMPs play an integral part in determining the result of neuroinflammation, in some cases turning its beneficial outcome into a harmful one. This review summarizes the most relevant studies concerning the physiology of MMPs, highlighting their involvement in both the developing and mature CNS, in long-lasting and acute brain diseases and, finally, in nervous system repair. Recently, a concerted effort has been made in identifying therapeutic strategies for major brain diseases by targeting MMP activities. However, from this revision of the literature appears clear that MMPs have multifaceted functional characteristics, which modulate physiological processes in multiple ways and with multiple consequences. Therefore, when choosing MMPs as possible targets, great care must be taken to evaluate the delicate balance between their activation and inhibition and to determine at which stage of the disease and at what level they become active in order maximize chances of success.","All currently approved drugs for schizophrenia work mainly by dopaminergic antagonism. While they are efficacious for psychotic symptoms, their efficacy is limited for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits which underlie the substantive disability in this illness. Recent insights into the biological basis of schizophrenia, especially in relation to non-dopaminergic mechanisms, have raised the efforts to find novel and effective drug targets, though with relatively little success thus far. Potential impediments to novel drug discovery include the continued use of symptom based disease definitions which leads to etiological and pathophysiological heterogeneity, lack of valid preclinical models for drug testing, and design limitations in clinical trials. These roadblocks can be addressed by (i) characterizing trans-diagnostic, translational pathophysiological dimensions as potential treatment targets, (ii) efficiency, accountability and, transparency in approaches to the clinical trials process, and (iii) leveraging recent advances in genetics and in vitro phenotypes. Accomplishing these goals is urgent given the significant unmet needs in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. As this happens, it is imperative that clinicians employ optimal dosing, measurement-based care, and other best practices in utilizing existing treatments to optimize outcomes for their patients today.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a highly complex disease involving a broad range of clinical, cellular, and biochemical manifestations that are currently not understood in combination. This has led to many views of AD, e.g. the amyloid, tau, presenilin, oxidative stress, and metal hypotheses. The amyloid hypothesis has dominated the field with its assumption that buildup of pathogenic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide causes disease. This paradigm has been criticized, yet most data suggest that Aβ plays a key role in the disease. Here, a new loss-of-function hypothesis is synthesized that accounts for the anomalies of the amyloid hypothesis, e.g. the curious pathogenicity of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, the loss of Aβ caused by presenilin mutation, the mixed phenotypes of APP mutations, the poor clinical-biochemical correlations for genetic variant carriers, and the failure of Aβ reducing drugs. The amyloid-loss view accounts for recent findings on the structure and chemical features of Aβ variants and their coupling to human patient data. The lost normal function of APP/Aβ is argued to be metal transport across neuronal membranes, a view with no apparent anomalies and substantially more explanatory power than the gain-of-function amyloid hypothesis. In the loss-of-function scenario, the central event of Aβ aggregation is interpreted as a loss of soluble, functional monomer Aβ rather than toxic overload of oligomers. Accordingly, new research models and treatment strategies should focus on remediation of the functional amyloid balance, rather than strict containment of Aβ, which, for reasons rationalized in this review, has failed clinically.","The developmental processes that establish the synaptic architecture of the brain while retaining capacity for activity-dependent remodeling, are complex and involve a combination of genetic and epigenetic influences. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to problems with neural circuitry which manifest in humans as a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and fragile X mental retardation. Recent studies suggest that prenatal, postnatal and intergenerational environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology of stress-related psychopathology. A number of these disorders have been shown to display epigenetic changes in the postmortem brain that reflect early life experience. These changes affect the regulation of gene expression though chromatin remodeling (transcriptional) and post-transcriptional influences, especially small noncoding microRNA (miRNA). These dynamic and influential molecules appear to play an important function in both brain development and its adaption to stress. In this review, we examine the role of miRNA in mediating the brain's response to both prenatal and postnatal environmental perturbations and explore how stress- induced alterations in miRNA expression can regulate the stress response via modulation of the immune system. Given the close relationship between environmental stress, miRNA, and brain development/function, we assert that miRNA hold a significant position at the molecular crossroads between neural development and adaptations to environmental stress. A greater understanding of the dynamics that mediate an individual's predisposition to stress-induced neuropathology has major human health benefits and is an important area of research.","The excessive extracellular accumulation of glutamate in the ischemic brain leads to an overactivation of glutamate receptors with consequent excitotoxic neuronal death. Neuronal demise is largely due to a sustained activation of NMDA receptors for glutamate, with a consequent increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and activation of calcium- dependent mechanisms. Calpains are a group of Ca(2+)-dependent proteases that truncate specific proteins, and some of the cleavage products remain in the cell, although with a distinct function. Numerous studies have shown pre- and post-synaptic effects of calpains on glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, targeting membrane- associated proteins as well as intracellular proteins. The resulting changes in the presynaptic proteome alter neurotransmitter release, while the cleavage of postsynaptic proteins affects directly or indirectly the activity of neurotransmitter receptors and downstream mechanisms. These alterations also disturb the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, with an impact in neuronal demise. In this review we discuss the evidence pointing to a role for calpains in the dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in brain ischemia, at the pre- and post-synaptic levels, as well as the functional consequences. Although targeting calpain-dependent mechanisms may constitute a good therapeutic approach for stroke, specific strategies should be developed to avoid non-specific effects given the important regulatory role played by these proteases under normal physiological conditions.","Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the manifestation of motor symptoms, which are mainly attributed to the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the pars compacta of substantia nigra. Based on advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, especially in animal models, the subthalamic nucleus has been pointed as a major target for deep brain stimulation in the treatment of motor symptoms, first developed in non-human primate and then successfully transfered to parkinsonian patients. Nevertheless, despite the focus on motor deficits, Parkinson's disease is also characterized by the manifestation of non-motor symptoms, which can be due to the additional degeneration of norepinephrine, serotonin and cholinergic systems. The pathophysiology of the non-motor symptoms is under studied and consequently not well treated. Furthermore, data from the literature about the impact of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on non-motor disorders are controversial and still under debate. Similarly, the risk of mood disorders post-deep brain stimulation surgery remains also controversial. Here, we review the clinical and experimental data of this neurosurgical approach on motor and non-motor behaviors and provide evidence for its interaction with the monoaminergic systems.","Though a multi-facetted disorder, Parkinson's disease is prototypically characterized by neurodegeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a severe disruption of motor function. Accordingly, L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine (DA), is well-established as a treatment for the motor deficits of Parkinson's disease despite long-term complications such as dyskinesia and psychiatric side-effects. Paradoxically, however, despite the traditional assumption that L-DOPA is transformed in residual striatal dopaminergic neurons into DA, the mechanism of action of L-DOPA is neither simple nor entirely clear. Herein, focussing on its influence upon extracellular DA and other neuromodulators in intact animals and experimental models of Parkinson's disease, we highlight effects other than striatal generation of DA in the functional profile of L-DOPA. While not excluding a minor role for glial cells, L-DOPA is principally transformed into DA in neurons yet, interestingly, with a more important role for serotonergic than dopaminergic projections. Moreover, in addition to the striatum, L-DOPA evokes marked increases in extracellular DA in frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, the subthalamic nucleus and additional extra-striatal regions. In considering its functional profile, it is also important to bear in mind the marked (probably indirect) influence of L-DOPA upon cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the basal ganglia and/or cortex, while anomalous serotonergic transmission is incriminated in the emergence of L-DOPA elicited dyskinesia and psychosis. Finally, L-DOPA may exert intrinsic receptor-mediated actions independently of DA neurotransmission and can be processed into bioactive metabolites. In conclusion, L-DOPA exerts a surprisingly complex pattern of neurochemical effects of much greater scope that mere striatal transformation into DA in spared dopaminergic neurons. Their further experimental and clinical clarification should help improve both L-DOPA-based and novel strategies for controlling the motor and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.","The scientific scenario of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has dramatically changed since TDP-43 aggregates were discovered in 2006 as the main component of the neuronal inclusions seen in the disease, and more recently, when the implication of C9ORF72 expansion in familial and sporadic cases of ALS and frontotemporal dementia was confirmed. These discoveries have enlarged an extense list of genes implicated in different cellular processes such as RNA processing or autophagia among others and have broaden the putative molecular targets of the disease. Some of ALS-related genes such as TARDBP or SOD1 among others have important roles in the regulation of glucose and fatty acids metabolism, so that an impairment of fatty acids (FA) consumption and ketogenic deficits during exercise in ALS patients would connect the physiopathology with some of the more intriguing epidemiological traits of the disease. The current understanding of ALS as part of a continuum with other neurodegenerative diseases and a crossroads between genetic, neurometabolic and environmental factors represent a fascinating model of interaction that could be translated to other neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we summarize the most relevant data obtained in the ten last years and the key lines for future research in ALS.","Most neurological diseases have a multifactorial nature and the number of molecular mechanisms discovered as underpinning these diseases is continuously evolving. The old concept of developing selective agents for a single target does not fit with the medical need of most neurological diseases. The development of designed multiple ligands holds great promises and appears as the next step in drug development for the treatment of these multifactorial diseases. Dopamine and its five receptor subtypes are intimately involved in numerous neurological disorders. Dopamine receptor ligands display a high degree of cross interactions with many other targets including G-protein coupled receptors, transporters, enzymes and ion channels. For brain disorders like Parkinsońs disease, schizophrenia and depression the dopaminergic system, being intertwined with many other signaling systems, plays a key role in pathogenesis and therapy. The concept of designed multiple ligands and polypharmacology, which perfectly meets the therapeutic needs for these brain disorders, is herein discussed as a general ligand-based concept while focusing on dopaminergic agents and receptor subtypes in particular.","Microglia/macrophages are the major immune cells involved in the defence against brain damage. Their morphology and functional changes are correlated with the release of danger signals induced by stroke. These cells are normally responsible for clearing away dead neural cells and restoring neuronal functions. However, when excessively activated by the damage-associated molecular patterns following stroke, they can produce a large number of proinflammatory cytokines that can disrupt neural cells and the blood-brain barrier and influence neurogenesis. These effects indicate the important roles of microglia/macrophages in the pathophysiological processes of stroke. However, the modifiable and adaptable nature of microglia/macrophages may also be beneficial for brain repair and not just result in damage. These distinct roles may be attributed to the different microglia/macrophage phenotypes because the M1 population is mainly destructive, while the M2 population is neuroprotective. Additionally, different gene expression signature changes in microglia/macrophages have been found in diverse inflammatory milieus. These biofunctional features enable dual roles for microglia/macrophages in brain damage and repair. Currently, it is thought that the proper inflammatory milieu may provide a suitable microenvironment for neurogenesis; however, detailed mechanisms underlying the inflammatory responses that initiate or inhibit neurogenesis remain unknown. This review summarizes recent progress concerning the mechanisms involved in brain damage, repair and regeneration related to microglia/macrophage activation and phenotype transition after stroke. We also argue that future translational studies should be targeting multiple key regulating molecules to improve brain repair, which should be accompanied by the concept of a ""therapeutic time window"" for sequential therapies.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health care crisis that affects two million individuals in the United Sates alone and over ten million worldwide each year. While numerous monotherapies have been evaluated and shown to be beneficial at the bench, similar results have not translated to the clinic. One reason for the lack of successful translation may be due to the fact that TBI is a heterogeneous disease that affects multiple mechanisms, thus requiring a therapeutic approach that can act on complementary, rather than single, targets. Hence, the use of combination therapies (i.e., polytherapy) has emerged as a viable approach. Stringent criteria, such as verification of each individual treatment plus the combination, a focus on behavioral outcome, and post-injury vs. pre-injury treatments, were employed to determine which studies were appropriate for review. The selection process resulted in 37 papers that fit the specifications. The review, which is the first to comprehensively assess the effects of combination therapies on behavioral outcomes after TBI, encompasses five broad categories (inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysregulation, neurotrophins, and stem cells, with and without rehabilitative therapies). Overall, the findings suggest that combination therapies can be more beneficial than monotherapies as indicated by 46% of the studies exhibiting an additive or synergistic positive effect versus on 19% reporting a negative interaction. These encouraging findings serve as an impetus for continued combination studies after TBI and ultimately for the development of successful clinically relevant therapies.","Research and treatment in the nervous system is challenged by many physiological barriers posing a major hurdle for neurologists. The CNS is protected by a formidable blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits surgical, therapeutic and diagnostic interventions. The hostile environment created by reactive astrocytes in the CNS along with the limited regeneration capacity of the PNS makes functional recovery after tissue damage difficult and inefficient. Nanomaterials have the unique ability to interface with neural tissue in the nano-scale and are capable of influencing the function of a single neuron. The ability of nanoparticles to transcend the BBB through surface modifications has been exploited in various neuro-imaging techniques and for targeted drug delivery. The tunable topography of nanofibers provides accurate spatio-temporal guidance to regenerating axons. This review is an attempt to comprehend the progress in understanding the obstacles posed by the complex physiology of the nervous system and the innovations in design and fabrication of advanced nanomaterials drawing inspiration from natural phenomenon. We also discuss the development of nanomaterials for use in Neuro-diagnostics, Neuro-therapy and the fabrication of advanced nano-devices for use in opto-electronic and ultrasensitive electrophysiological applications. The energy efficient and parallel computing ability of the human brain has inspired the design of advanced nanotechnology based computational systems. However, extensive use of nanomaterials in neuroscience also raises serious toxicity issues as well as ethical concerns regarding nano implants in the brain. In conclusion we summarize these challenges and provide an insight into the huge potential of nanotechnology platforms in neuroscience.","Mitochondria are a major target in hypoxic/ischemic injury. Mitochondrial impairment increases with age leading to dysregulation of molecular pathways linked to mitochondria. The perturbation of mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular energetics worsens outcome following hypoxic-ischemic insults in elderly individuals. In response to acute injury conditions, cellular machinery relies on rapid adaptations by modulating posttranslational modifications. Therefore, post-translational regulation of molecular mediators such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC-1α), c-MYC, SIRT1 and AMPK play a critical role in the control of the glycolytic-mitochondrial energy axis in response to hypoxic-ischemic conditions. The deficiency of oxygen and nutrients leads to decreased energetic reliance on mitochondria, promoting glycolysis. The combination of pseudohypoxia, declining autophagy, and dysregulation of stress responses with aging adds to impaired host response to hypoxic-ischemic injury. Furthermore, intermitochondrial signal propagation and tissue wide oscillations in mitochondrial metabolism in response to oxidative stress are emerging as vital to cellular energetics. Recently reported intercellular transport of mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes also play a role in the response to and treatments for ischemic injury. In this review we attempt to provide an overview of some of the molecular mechanisms and potential therapies involved in the alteration of cellular energetics with aging and injury with a neurobiological perspective.","Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare neurological disorder caused by a splice mutation in the IKBKAP gene. The mutation arose in the 1500s within the small Jewish founder population in Eastern Europe and became prevalent during the period of rapid population expansion within the Pale of Settlement. The carrier rate is 1:32 in Jews descending from this region. The mutation results in a tissue-specific deficiency in IKAP, a protein involved in the development and survival of neurons. Patients homozygous for the mutations are born with multiple lesions affecting mostly sensory (afferent) fibers, which leads to widespread organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Neurodegenerative features of the disease include progressive optic atrophy and worsening gait ataxia. Here we review the progress made in the last decade to better understand the genotype and phenotype. We also discuss the challenges of conducting controlled clinical trials in this rare medically fragile population. Meanwhile, the search for better treatments as well as a neuroprotective agent is ongoing.","Cytoskeleton defects, including alterations in microtubule stability, in axonal transport as well as in actin dynamics, have been characterized in several unrelated neurodegenerative conditions. These observations suggest that defects of cytoskeleton organization may be a common feature contributing to neurodegeneration. In line with this hypothesis, drugs targeting the cytoskeleton are currently being tested in animal models and in human clinical trials, showing promising effects. Drugs that modulate microtubule stability, inhibitors of posttranslational modifications of cytoskeletal components, specifically compounds affecting the levels of tubulin acetylation, and compounds targeting signaling molecules which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics, constitute the mostly addressed therapeutic interventions aiming at preventing cytoskeleton damage in neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we will discuss in a critical perspective the current knowledge on cytoskeleton damage pathways as well as therapeutic strategies designed to revert cytoskeleton-related defects mainly focusing on the following neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.","Stroke is one of the major causes of disability and mortality worldwide. It is well known that ischemic stroke can cause gray matter injury. However, stroke also elicits profound white matter injury, a risk factor for higher stroke incidence and poor neurological outcomes. The majority of damage caused by stroke is located in subcortical regions and, remarkably, white matter occupies nearly half of the average infarct volume. Indeed, white matter is exquisitely vulnerable to ischemia and is often injured more severely than gray matter. Clinical symptoms related to white matter injury include cognitive dysfunction, emotional disorders, sensorimotor impairments, as well as urinary incontinence and pain, all of which are closely associated with destruction and remodeling of white matter connectivity. White matter injury can be noninvasively detected by MRI, which provides a three-dimensional assessment of its morphology, metabolism, and function. There is an urgent need for novel white matter therapies, as currently available strategies are limited to preclinical animal studies. Optimal protection against ischemic stroke will need to encompass the fortification of both gray and white matter. In this review, we discuss white matter injury after ischemic stroke, focusing on clinical features and tools, such as imaging, manifestation, and potential treatments. We also briefly discuss the pathophysiology of WMI and future research directions.","Chronic pain is a common squealae of military- and terror-related injuries. While its pathophysiology has not yet been fully elucidated, it may be potentially related to premorbid neuropsychobiological status, as well as to the type of injury and to the neural alterations that it may evoke. Accordingly, optimized approaches for wounded individuals should integrate primary, secondary and tertiary prevention in the form of thorough evaluation of risk factors along with specific interventions to contravene and mitigate the ensuing chronicity. Thus, Premorbid Events phase may encompass assessments of psychological and neurobiological vulnerability factors in conjunction with fostering preparedness and resilience in both military and civilian populations at risk. Injuries per se phase calls for immediate treatment of acute pain in the field by pharmacological agents that spare and even enhance coping and adaptive capabilities. The key objective of the Post Injury Events is to prevent and/or reverse maladaptive peripheral- and central neural system's processes that mediate transformation of acute to chronic pain and to incorporate timely interventions for concomitant mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder and addiction We suggest that the proposed continuum of care may avert more disability and suffering than the currently employed less integrated strategies. While the requirements of the armed forces present a pressing need for this integrated continuum and a framework in which it can be most readily implemented, this approach may be also instrumental for the care of civilian casualties.","Localization of sound sources is a central aspect of auditory processing. A unique feature of mammals is the smooth, tonotopically organized extension of the hearing range to high frequencies (HF) above 10kHz, which likely induced positive selection for novel mechanisms of sound localization. How this change in the auditory periphery is accompanied by changes in the central auditory system is unresolved. I will argue that the major VGlut2(+) excitatory projection neurons of sound localization circuits (dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), lateral and medial superior olive (LSO and MSO)) represent serial homologs with modifications, thus being paramorphs. This assumption is based on common embryonic origin from an Atoh1(+)/Wnt1(+) cell lineage in the rhombic lip of r5, same cell birth, a fusiform cell morphology, shared genetic components such as Lhx2 and Lhx9 transcription factors, and similar projection patterns. Such a parsimonious evolutionary mechanism likely accelerated the emergence of neurons for sound localization in all three dimensions. Genetic analyses indicate that auditory nuclei in fish, birds, and mammals receive contributions from the same progenitor lineages. Anatomical and physiological differences and the independent evolution of tympanic ears in vertebrate groups, however, argue for convergent evolution of sound localization circuits in tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). These disparate findings are discussed in the context of the genetic architecture of the developing hindbrain, which facilitates convergent evolution. Yet, it will be critical to decipher the gene regulatory networks underlying development of auditory neurons across vertebrates to explore the possibility of homologous neuronal populations.","There is a large consensus that the prenatal environment determines the susceptibility to pathological conditions later in life. The hypothesis most widely accepted is that exposure to insults inducing adverse conditions in-utero may have negative effects on the development of target organs, disrupting homeostasis and increasing the risk of diseases at adulthood. Several models have been proposed to investigate the fetal origins of adult diseases, but although these approaches hold true for almost all diseases, particular attention has been focused on disorders related to the central nervous system, since the brain is particularly sensitive to alterations of the microenvironment during early development. Neurobiological disorders can be broadly divided into developmental, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Even though most of these diseases share genetic risk factors, the onset of the disorders cannot be explained solely by inheritance. Therefore, current understanding presumes that the interactions of environmental input, may lead to different disorders. Among the insults that can play a direct or indirect role in the development of neurobiological disorders are stress, infections, drug abuse, and environmental contaminants. Our laboratories have been involved in the study of the neurobiological impact of gestational stress on the offspring (Dr. Antonelli's lab) and on the effect of gestational exposure to toxicants, mainly methyl mercury (MeHg) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (Dr. Ceccatelli's lab). In this focused review, we will review the specialized literature but we will concentrate mostly on our own work on the long term neurodevelopmental consequences of gestational exposure to stress and neurotoxicants.","Many psychiatric and behavioral disorders manifest in childhood (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, etc.) and the opportunity for intervening early may attenuate full development of the disorder and lessen long term disability. Yet, pediatric drug approvals for CNS indications are limited, and pediatric testing generally occurs only after establishing adult efficacy, more as an afterthought rather than with the initial goal of developing the medication for a pediatric CNS indication. With pharmaceutical companies decreasing funding of their neuroscience research divisions overall, the prospects for moving promising investigational drugs forward into pediatrics will only decline. The goal of this review is to highlight important challenges around pediatric drug development for psychiatric disorders, specifically during clinical development, and to present opportunities for filling these gaps, using new strategies for de-risking investigational drugs in new clinical trial designs/models. We will first present the current trends in pediatric drug efficacy testing in academic research and in industry trials, we will then discuss the regulatory landscape of pediatric drug testing, including policies intended to support and encourage more testing. Obstacles that remain will then be presented, followed by new designs, funding opportunities and considerations for testing investigational drugs safely.","Over the last decade the important concept has emerged that microglia, similar to other tissue macrophages, assume different phenotypes and serve several effector functions, generating the theory that activated microglia can be organized by their pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory and repairing functions. Importantly, microglia exist in a heterogenous population and their phenotypes are not permanently polarized into two categories; they exist along a continuum where they acquire different profiles based on their local environment. In Parkinson's disease (PD), neuroinflammation and microglia activation are considered neuropathological hallmarks, however their precise role in relation to disease progression is not clear, yet represent a critical challenge in the search of disease-modifying strategies. This review will critically address current knowledge on the activation states of microglia as well as microglial phenotypes found in PD and in animal models of PD, focusing on the expression of surface molecules as well as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production during the disease process. While human studies have reported an elevation of both pro- or anti-inflammatory markers in the serum and CSF of PD patients, animal models have provided insights on dynamic changes of microglia phenotypes in relation to disease progression especially prior to the development of motor deficits. We also review recent evidence of malfunction at multiple steps of NFκB signaling that may have a causal interrelationship with pathological microglia activation in animal models of PD. Finally, we discuss the immune-modifying strategies that have been explored regarding mechanisms of chronic microglial activation.","Recent attempts to analyze human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-induced gene expression changes in astrocytes uncovered a multifunctional oncogene, astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Our previous studies revealed that AEG-1 regulates reactive astrocytes proliferation, migration and inflammation, hallmarks of aging and CNS injury. Moreover, the involvement of AEG-1 in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease and migraine, and its induction in the aged brain suggest a plausible role in regulating overall CNS homeostasis and aging. Therefore, it is important to investigate AEG-1 specifically in aging-associated cognitive decline. In this study, we decipher the common mechanistic links in cancer, aging and HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders that likely contribute to AEG-1-based regulation of astrocyte responses and function. Despite AEG-1 incorporation into HIV-1 virions and its induction by HIV-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, the specific role(s) of AEG-1 in astrocyte-driven HIV-1 neuropathogenesis are incompletely defined. We propose that AEG-1 plays a central role in a multitude of cellular stress responses involving mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleolus. It is thus important to further investigate AEG-1-based cellular and molecular regulation in order to successfully develop better therapeutic approaches that target AEG-1 to combat cancer, HIV-1 and aging.","None of the proposed mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) fully explains the distribution patterns of the neuropathological changes at the cellular and regional levels, and their clinical correlates. One aspect of this problem lies in the complex genetic, epigenetic, and environmental landscape of AD: early-onset AD is often familial with autosomal dominant inheritance, while the vast majority of AD cases are late-onset, with the ε4 variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) known to confer a 5-20 fold increased risk with partial penetrance. Mechanisms by which genetic variants and environmental factors influence the development of AD pathological changes, especially neurofibrillary degeneration, are not yet known. Here we review current knowledge of the involvement of the monoaminergic systems in AD. The changes in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and melatonergic systems in AD are briefly described. We also summarize the possibilities for monoamine-based treatment in AD. Besides neuropathologic AD criteria that include the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), special emphasis is given to the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Both of these brainstem nuclei are among the first to be affected by tau protein abnormalities in the course of sporadic AD, causing behavioral and cognitive symptoms of variable severity. The possibility that most of the tangle-bearing neurons of the LC and DRN may release amyloid β as well as soluble monomeric or oligomeric tau protein trans-synaptically by their diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex emphasizes their selective vulnerability and warrants further investigations of the monoaminergic systems in AD.","HIV infection often causes neurological symptoms including cognitive and motor dysfunction, which have been collectively termed HIV/neuroAIDS. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical symptoms have been the primary diagnostic criteria for HIV/neuroAIDS, even for the mild cognitive and motor disorder, the most prevalent form of HIV/neuroAIDS in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy. Those performance-based assessments and symptoms are generally descriptive and do not have the sensitivity and specificity to monitor the diagnosis, progression, and treatment response of the disease when compared to objective and quantitative laboratory-based biological markers, or biomarkers. In addition, effects of demographics and comorbidities such as substance abuse, psychiatric disease, nutritional deficiencies, and co-infection on HIV/neuroAIDS could be more readily determined using biomarkers than using neuropsychological assessment and clinical symptoms. Thus, there have been great efforts in identification of HIV/neuroAIDS biomarkers over the past two decades. The need for reliable biomarkers of HIV/neuroAIDS is expected to increase as the HIV-infected population ages and their vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease increases. Currently, three classes of HIV/neuroAIDS biomarkers are being pursued to establish objective laboratory-based definitions of HIV-associated neurologic injury: cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and neuroimaging biomarkers. In this review, we will focus on the current knowledge in the field of HIV/neuroAIDS biomarker discovery.","Self-preservation is required for life. At the cellular level, this fundamental principle is expressed in the form of molecular mechanisms for preconditioning and tolerance. When the cell is threatened, internal cascades of survival signaling become triggered to protect against cell death and defend against future insults. Recently, however, emerging findings suggest that this principle of self-preservation may involve not only intracellular signals; the release of extracellular signals may provide a way to recruit adjacent cells into an amplified protective program. In the central nervous system where multiple cell types co-exist, this mechanism would allow threatened neurons to ""ask for help"" from glial and vascular compartments. In this review, we describe this new concept of help-me signaling, wherein damaged or diseased neurons release signals that may shift glial and vascular cells into potentially beneficial phenotypes, and help remodel the neurovascular unit. Understanding and dissecting these non-cell autonomous mechanisms of self-preservation in the CNS may lead to novel opportunities for neuroprotection and neurorecovery.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and localized neuroinflammation occurring in the midbrain several years before the actual onset of symptoms. Neuroinflammation leads to microglia activation and release of a large number of proinflammatory mediators. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan catabolism is one of the major regulators of the immune response and is also likely to be implicated in the inflammatory and neurotoxic events in Parkinsonism. Several neuroactive compounds are produced through the KP that can be either a neurotoxic, neuroprotective or immunomodulator. Among these metabolites kynurenic acid (KYNA), produced by astrocytes, is considered as neuroprotective whereas quinolinic acid (QUIN), released by activated microglia, can activate the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-signalling pathway, leading to excitotoxicity and amplify the inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that NMDA antagonists can ease symptoms and exert a neuroprotective effect in PD both in vivo and in vitro. There are to date several lines of evidence linking some of the KP intermediates and the neuropathogenesis of PD. Moreover, it is likely that some of the KP metabolites could be used as prognostic biomarkers and that pharmacological modulators of the KP enzymes could represent a new therapeutic strategy for PD.","There are many challenges to developing treatments for complex diseases. This review explores the question of whether it is possible to imagine a data repository that would increase the pace of understanding complex diseases sufficiently well to facilitate the development of effective treatments. First, consideration is given to the amount of data that might be needed for such a data repository and whether the existing data storage infrastructure is enough. Several successful data repositories are then examined to see if they have common characteristics. An area of science where unsuccessful attempts to develop a data infrastructure is then described to see what lessons could be learned for a data repository devoted to complex disease. Then, a variety of issues related to sharing data are discussed. In some of these areas, it is reasonably clear how to move forward. In other areas, there are significant open questions that need to be addressed by all data repositories. Using that baseline information, the question of whether data archives can be effective in understanding a complex disease is explored. The major goal of such a data archive is likely to be identifying biomarkers that define sub-populations of the disease.","Since their discovery in the mammalian brain, it has been apparent that serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) interactions play a key role in normal and abnormal behavior. Therefore, disclosure of this interaction could reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction or neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome. Unfortunately, this interaction remains difficult to study for many reasons, including the rich and widespread innervations of 5-HT and DA in the brain, the plethora of 5-HT receptors and the release of co-transmitters by 5-HT and DA neurons. The purpose of this review is to present electrophysiological and biochemical data showing that endogenous 5-HT and pharmacological 5-HT ligands modify the mesencephalic DA systems' activity. 5-HT receptors may control DA neuron activity in a state-dependent and region-dependent manner. 5-HT controls the activity of DA neurons in a phasic and excitatory manner, except for the control exerted by 5-HT2C receptors which appears to also be tonically and/or constitutively inhibitory. The functional interaction between the two monoamines will also be discussed in view of the mechanism of action of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-Parkinsonians and drugs of abuse.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytrympamine or 5-HT) is one of the phylogenetically oldest neurotransmitters, and the serotonergic system is among the earliest developed neuronal systems. Serotonin is critically involved in regulating multiple physiological functions, acting via a heterogenic receptor family that includes G protein-coupled receptors and ligand-gated ion channels. Although serotonergic neurons comprise a widely distributed and complex network that targets nearly every brain structure, serotonin-mediated signalling is under strict temporal and spatial control. Imbalance in serotonergic signalling is implicated in many pathophysiological conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety. In addition to its well-established role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin is involved in many aspects of neural development, including neurite outgrowth, somatic morphology regulation, growth cone motility, synaptogenesis, and control of dendritic spine shape and density. The morphogenic effects of serotonin are developmentally regulated, and serotonin availability during sensitive developmental stages can modulate the formation and functions of behaviourally relevant neuronal networks in adulthood. Here we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the morphogenic effects of serotonin elicited by its different receptors in neurons. We also discuss the role of serotonin receptor-mediated morphogenic signalling in the development and maintenance of pathophysiological conditions.","This article reviews the application of information-theoretical analysis, employing measures of entropy and mutual information, for the study of aging and aging-related diseases. The research of aging and aging-related diseases is particularly suitable for the application of information theory methods, as aging processes and related diseases are multi-parametric, with continuous parameters coexisting alongside discrete parameters, and with the relations between the parameters being as a rule non-linear. Information theory provides unique analytical capabilities for the solution of such problems, with unique advantages over common linear biostatistics. Among the age-related diseases, information theory has been used in the study of neurodegenerative diseases (particularly using EEG time series for diagnosis and prediction), cancer (particularly for establishing individual and combined cancer biomarkers), diabetes (mainly utilizing mutual information to characterize the diseased and aging states), and heart disease (mainly for the analysis of heart rate variability). Few works have employed information theory for the analysis of general aging processes and frailty, as underlying determinants and possible early preclinical diagnostic measures for aging-related diseases. Generally, the use of information-theoretical analysis permits not only establishing the (non-linear) correlations between diagnostic or therapeutic parameters of interest, but may also provide a theoretical insight into the nature of aging and related diseases by establishing the measures of variability, adaptation, regulation or homeostasis, within a system of interest. It may be hoped that the increased use of such measures in research may considerably increase diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and the fundamental theoretical mathematical understanding of aging and disease.","Many mammalian species naturally undergo hibernation, a process that is associated with drastic changes in metabolism and systemic physiology. Their ability to retain an undamaged central nervous system during severely reduced cerebral blood flow has been studied for possible therapeutic application in human ischemic stroke. By inducing a less extreme 'hibernation-like' state, it has been hypothesized that similar neuroprotective effects reduce ischemia-mediated tissue damage in stroke patients. This manuscript includes reviews and evaluations of: (1) true hibernation, (2) hibernation-like state and its neuroprotective characteristics, (3) the preclinical and clinical methods for induction of artificial hibernation (i.e., therapeutic hypothermia, phenothiazine drugs, and ethanol), and (4) the mechanisms by which cerebral ischemia leads to tissue damage and how the above-mentioned induction methods function to inhibit those processes.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, disabling disorder characterized by immune-mediated demyelination, inflammation, and neurodegenerative tissue damage in the central nervous system (CNS), associated with frequent exacerbations and remissions of neurologic symptoms and eventual permanent neurologic disability. While there are several MS therapies that are successful in reducing MS relapses, none have been effective in treating all patients. The specific response of an individual patient to any one of the MS therapies remains largely unpredictable, and physicians and patients are forced to use a trial and error approach when deciding on treatment regimens. A priori markers to predict the optimal benefit-to-risk profile of an individual MS patient would greatly facilitate the decision-making process, thereby helping the patient receive the most optimal treatment early on in the disease process. Pharmacogenomic methods evaluate how a person's genetic and genomic makeup affects their response to therapeutics. This review focuses on how pharmacogenomics studies are being used to identify biologically relevant differences in MS treatments and provide characterization of the predictive clinical response patterns. As pharmacogenomics research is dependent on the availability of longitudinal clinical research, studies concerning glatiramer acetate and the interferon beta products which have the majority of published long term data to date are described in detail. These studies have provided considerable insight in the prognostic markers associated with MS disease and potential predictive markers of safety and beneficial response.","There is ample empirical evidence to support the notion that the biological impacts of estrogen extend beyond the gonads to other bodily systems, including the brain and behavior. Converging preclinical findings have indicated a neuroprotective role for estrogen in a variety of experimental models of cognitive function and brain insult. However, the surprising null or even detrimental findings of several large clinical trials evaluating the ability of estrogen-containing hormone treatments to protect against age-related brain changes and insults, including cognitive aging and brain injury, led to hesitation by both clinicians and patients in the use of exogenous estrogenic treatments for nervous system outcomes. That estrogen-containing therapies are used by tens of millions of women for a variety of health-related applications across the lifespan has made identifying conditions under which benefits with estrogen treatment will be realized an important public health issue. Here we provide a summary of the biological actions of estrogen and estrogen-containing formulations in the context of aging, cognition, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. We have devoted special attention to highlighting the notion that estrogen appears to be a conditional neuroprotectant whose efficacy is modulated by several interacting factors. By developing criteria standards for desired beneficial peripheral and neuroprotective outcomes among unique patient populations, we can optimize estrogen treatments for attenuating the consequences of, and perhaps even preventing, cognitive aging and brain injury.","The neurofibromatoses (NF) are a group of rare genetic disorders that can affect all races equally at an incidence from 1:3000 (NF1) to a log unit lower for NF2 and schwannomatosis. Since the research community is reporting an increasing number of malignant cancers that carry mutations in the NF genes, the general interest of both the research and pharma community is increasing and the authors saw an opportunity to present a novel, fresh approach to drug discovery in NF. The aim of the paper is to challenge the current drug discovery approach to NF, whereby existing targeted therapies that are either in the clinic or on the market for other disease indications are repurposed for NF. We offer a suggestion for an alternative drug discovery approach. In the new approach, selective and tolerable targeted therapies would be developed for NF and later expanded to patients with more complex diseases such as malignant cancer in which the NF downstream pathways are deregulated. The Children's Tumor Foundation, together with some other major NF funders, is playing a key role in funding critical initiatives that will accelerate the development of better targeted therapies for NF patients, while these novel, innovative treatments could potentially be beneficial to molecularly characterized cancer patients in which NF mutations have been identified.","Microglia are brain resident macrophages originated from primitive progenitor cells in the yolk sac. Microglia can be activated within hours and recruited to the lesion site. Traditionally, microglia activation is considered to play a deleterious role in ischemic stroke, as inhibition of microglia activation attenuates ischemia induced brain injury. However, increasing evidence show that microglia activation is critical for attenuating neuronal apoptosis, enhancing neurogenesis, and promoting functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. Differential polarization of microglia could likely explain the biphasic role of microglia in ischemia. We comprehensively reviewed the mechanisms involved in regulating microglia activation and polarization. The latest discoveries of microRNAs in modulating microglia function are discussed. In addition, the interaction between microglia and other cells including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and stem cells were also reviewed. Future therapies targeting microglia may not exclusively aim at suppressing microglia activation, but also at modulating microglia polarization at different stages of ischemic stroke. More work is needed to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of microglia polarization under ischemic environment. The roles of microRNAs and transplanted stem cells in mediating microglia activation and polarization during brain ischemia also need to be further studied.","Neural cell identity reprogramming strategies aim to treat age-related neurodegenerative disorders with newly induced neurons that regenerate neural architecture and functional circuits in vivo. The isolation and neural differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells provided the first in vitro models of human neurodegenerative disease. Investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell pluripotency revealed that somatic cells could be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and these cells could be used to model Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease. Additional neural precursor and direct transdifferentiation strategies further enabled the induction of diverse neural linages and neuron subtypes both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we highlight neural induction strategies that utilize stem cells, iPSCs, and lineage reprogramming to model or treat age-related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as, the clinical challenges related to neural transplantation and in vivo reprogramming strategies.","Although neurons attract the most attention in neurobiology, our current knowledge of neural circuit can only partially explain the neurological and psychiatric conditions of the brain. Thus, it is also important to consider the influence of brain interstitial system (ISS), which refers to the space among neural cells and capillaries. The ISS is the major compartment of the brain microenvironment that provides the immediate accommodation space for neural cells, and it occupies 15% to 20% of the total brain volume. The brain ISS is a dynamic and complex space connecting the vascular system and neural networks and it plays crucial roles in substance transport and signal transmission among neurons. Investigation of the brain ISS can provide new perspectives for understanding brain architecture and function and for exploring new strategies to treat brain disorders. This review discussed the anatomy of the brain ISS under both physiological and pathological conditions, biophysical modeling of the brain ISS and in vivo measurement and imaging techniques, including recent findings on brain ISS divisions. Moreover, the implications of ISS knowledge for basic neuroscience and clinical applications are addressed.","Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) comprise a family of cytoplasmic transcription factors that mediate intracellular signaling. This signaling is typically generated at cell surface receptors, the activation of which results in the translocation of STATs to the nucleus. STATs are involved in biological events as diverse as embryonic development, programmed cell death, organogenesis, innate immunity, adaptive immunity and cell growth regulation in organisms ranging from slime molds to insects to humans. Numerous studies have demonstrated the activation of STAT3 in neurological diseases, particularly in cerebral ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, STAT3 has also been reported to play a critical role in neuroprotective therapies. In light of the pleiotropic effects of STAT3 on the nervous system, we present the elaborate network of roles that STAT3 plays in cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage in this review. First, we introduce basic knowledge regarding STAT3 and briefly summarize the activation, inactivation, and regulation of the STAT3 pathway. Next, we describe the activation of STAT3 following cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage. Subsequently, we discuss the physiopathological roles of STAT3 in cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage. Moreover, we summarize several significant cerebral ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke treatments that target the STAT3 signaling pathway, including pharmacological and physical therapies. Finally, we highlight research progress on STAT3 in stroke. This review presents the important roles of STAT3 in the nervous system and may contribute to the promotion of STAT3 as a new therapeutic target.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases in modern society because of insurmountable difficulties in early diagnosis and lack of therapeutic treatments. AD pathogenesis is tightly linked to the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ), seemingly the main causative factor of AD; however, intensive research on Aβ has not yet explained the complexity of AD pathogenesis. Consequently, the role of other supportive partners of Aβ have been elucidated and evaluated in the etiology of AD, and their potential molecular mechanisms have emerged as possible therapeutic targets. In this review, we compile information regarding Aβ-interacting partners in normal conditions and AD pathology, and analyze their etiological roles in diverse areas. Furthermore, we integrate this information into suggestions for probable clinical applications for AD diagnosis and therapeutics. We include Aβ-interacting partners localized to the cell surface and intracellular and extracellular compartments of different cell types ranging from the central nervous system to peripheral regions. Additionally, we expand the range of Aβ-interacting partners by including not only proteins, but also inorganic substances like metals, expecting that one of these partners may yield a critical breakthrough in the field of AD diagnostics and therapeutic drug development.","Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial and fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decline of cholinergic function, deregulation of other neurotransmitter systems, β-amyloid fibril deposition, and β-amyloid oligomers formation. Based on the involvement of a relevant number of biological systems in Alzheimer's disease progression, multitarget compounds may enable therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, compounds possessing, besides anticholinergic activity and β-amyloid aggregation inhibition properties, metal chelating and/or nitric oxide releasing properties with additional antioxidant capacity were developed. Other targets relevant to Alzheimer's disease have also been considered in the last years for producing multitarget compounds such as β-secretase, monoamino oxidases, serotonin receptors and sigma 1 receptors. The purpose of this review will be to highlight recent reports on the development of multitarget compounds for Alzheimer's disease published within the last years focusing on multifunctional ligands characterized by tacrine-like and donepezil-like structures.","This review considers the history of drug development in primary headaches and discusses challenges to the discovery of innovative headache therapeutics. Advances in headache genetics have yet to translate to new classes of therapeutics and there are currently no clear predictive human biomarkers for any of the primary headaches that can guide preventative drug discovery and development. Primary headache disorder subtypes despite common phenotypic presentation are undoubtedly heterogeneous in their pathophysiology as judged by the variability of response to headache medicines. Sub-classification of headache subtypes into more homogenous and specific phenotypes groups may facilitate genotyping and provide sentinel patient groups that can be used in a mechanism specific manner to test new and more personalized treatment strategies in headache medicine. The development of the triptan class of serotonin 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptor agonists has advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine pain, which subsequently resulted in the development of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) modulators that are now showing promise as acute and preventative anti-migraine agents. Despite these successes, there have been many near misses and failures in the discovery and development of headache therapeutics. Glutamate receptor antagonism whilst efficacious has central side effects and some approaches such as nitric oxide synthase inhibition, substance P antagonism and cortical spreading depression blockade, despite having promising effects in basic pain models, have not delivered efficacy in the clinic. Future efforts may triage novel physiological mediators using human experimental models of headache pain to support drug discovery strategies that target active pathways pharmacologically.","Neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates such as Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, synucleinopathies, and prionopathies, together with vascular encephalopathies, are cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Identification of reliable biomarkers in biological fluids, particularly in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is of extreme importance in optimizing the precise early clinical diagnosis of distinct entities and predicting the outcome in particular settings. In addition, the study of CSF biomarkers is useful to identify and monitor the underlying pathological processes developing in the central nervous system of affected individuals. Evidence suggests that levels of key CSF molecules correlate, in some circumstances, with prediction, disease progression, and severity of cognitive decline. Correlation of CSF markers and underlying pathological molecular substrates in brain is an exciting field for further study. However, while some dementias such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have accurate CSF biomarkers, other disease types such as dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia lack reliable biomarkers for their specific clinical diagnosis.","Epilepsy is a common central nervous system (CNS) disease characterized by recurrent transient neurological events occurring due to abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. The CNS is affected by systemic acid-base disorders, and epileptic seizures are sensitive indicators of underlying imbalances in cellular pH regulation. Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) are a family of membrane transporter proteins actively involved in regulating intracellular and organellar pH by extruding H(+) in exchange for Na(+) influx. Altering NHE function significantly influences neuronal excitability and plays a role in epilepsy. This review gives an overview of pH regulatory mechanisms in the brain with a special focus on the NHE family and the relationship between epilepsy and dysfunction of NHE isoforms. We first discuss how cells translocate acids and bases across the membrane and establish pH homeostasis as a result of the concerted effort of enzymes and ion transporters. We focus on the specific roles of the NHE family by detailing how the loss of NHE1 in two NHE mutant mice results in enhanced neuronal excitability in these animals. Furthermore, we highlight new findings on the link between mutations of NHE6 and NHE9 and developmental brain disorders including epilepsy, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These studies demonstrate the importance of NHE proteins in maintaining H(+) homeostasis and their intricate roles in the regulation of neuronal function. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying NHE1, 6, and 9 dysfunctions in epilepsy formation may advance the development of new epilepsy treatment strategies.","Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. It has become increasingly clear that while neuronal cell loss in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus occurs in Alzheimer's disease, it is preceded by a long period of deficits in the connectivity of the hippocampal formation that contributes to the vulnerability of these circuits. Hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in the maintenance and function of the dentate gyrus and hippocampal circuitry. This review will examine the evidence suggesting that hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in cognitive function that is affected in Alzheimer's disease, will discuss the cognitive assessments used for the detection of Alzheimer's disease in humans and rodent models of familial Alzheimer's disease, and their value for unraveling the mechanism underlying the development of cognitive impairments and dementia.","Preterm birth is an evolving challenge in neonatal health care. Despite declining mortality rates among extremely premature neonates, morbidity rates remain very high. Currently, perinatal diffuse white matter injury (WMI) is the most commonly observed type of brain injury in preterm infants and has become an important research area. Diffuse WMI is associated with impaired cognitive, sensory and psychological functioning and is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for autism-spectrum disorders, ADHD, and other psychological disturbances. No treatment options are currently available for diffuse WMI and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are far from being completely understood. Preterm birth is associated with maternal inflammation, perinatal infections and disrupted oxygen supply which can affect the cerebral microenvironment by causing activation of microglia, astrogliosis, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. This intricate interplay of events negatively influences oligodendrocyte development, causing arrested oligodendrocyte maturation or oligodendrocyte cell death, which ultimately results in myelination failure in the developing white matter. This review discusses the current state in perinatal WMI research, ranging from a clinical perspective to basic molecular pathophysiology. The complex regulation of oligodendrocyte development in healthy and pathological conditions is described, with a specific focus on signaling cascades that may play a role in WMI. Furthermore, emerging concepts in the field of WMI and issues regarding currently available animal models are put forward. Novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying impeded oligodendrocyte maturation in diffuse WMI may aid the development of novel treatment options which are desperately needed to improve the quality-of-life of preterm neonates.","Schizophrenia has long been considered as a disorder with multifactorial origins. Recent discoveries have advanced our understanding of the genetic architecture of the disease. However, even with the increase of identified risk variants, heritability estimates suggest an important contribution of non-genetic factors. Various environmental risk factors have been proposed to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia. These include season of birth, maternal infections, obstetric complications, adverse events at early childhood, and drug abuse. Despite the progress in identification of genetic and environmental risk factors, we still have a limited understanding of the mechanisms whereby gene-environment interactions (G × E) operate in schizophrenia and psychoses at large. In this review we provide a critical analysis of current animal models of G × E relevant to psychotic disorders and propose that dimensional perspective will advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms of these disorders.","Current therapeutic options for major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are associated with a lag of onset that can prolong distress and impairment for patients, and their antidepressant efficacy is often limited. All currently approved antidepressant medications for MDD act primarily through monoaminergic mechanisms. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and glutamate and its cognate receptors are implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, and in the development of novel therapeutics for this disorder. The rapid and robust antidepressant effects of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine were first observed in 2000. Since then, other NMDA receptor antagonists have been studied in MDD. Most have demonstrated relatively modest antidepressant effects compared to ketamine, but some have shown more favorable characteristics. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting the use of novel glutamate receptor modulators with direct affinity for cognate receptors: (1) non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists (ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan, AZD6765); (2) subunit (GluN2B)-specific NMDA receptor antagonists (CP-101,606/traxoprodil, MK-0657); (3) NMDA receptor glycine-site partial agonists (GLYX-13); and (4) metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) modulators (AZD2066, RO4917523/basimglurant). We also briefly discuss several other theoretical glutamate receptor targets with preclinical antidepressant-like efficacy that have yet to be studied clinically; these include α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) agonists and mGluR2/3 negative allosteric modulators. The review also discusses other promising, non-glutamatergic targets for potential rapid antidepressant effects, including the cholinergic system (scopolamine), the opioid system (ALKS-5461), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonists (CP-316,311), and others.","Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that afflicts 1 in 2000 individuals and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy-a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by positive emotions. Features of narcolepsy include dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic disturbances. Disruption of neurotransmission through the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, usually by degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of Hcrt neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes. Current treatments for narcolepsy are symptomatic, including wake-promoting therapeutics that increase presynaptic dopamine release and anticataplectic agents that activate monoaminergic neurotransmission. Sodium oxybate is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that alleviates both sleep/wake disturbances and cataplexy. Development of therapeutics for narcolepsy has been challenged by historical misunderstanding of the disease, its many disparate symptoms and, until recently, its unknown etiology. Animal models have been essential to elucidating the neuropathology underlying narcolepsy. These models have also aided understanding the neurobiology of the Hcrt system, mechanisms of cataplexy, and the pharmacology of narcolepsy medications. Transgenic rodent models will be critical in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of narcolepsy, particularly efforts directed to overcome challenges in the development of hypocretin replacement therapy.","Proteins belonging to the 'A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase' (ADAM) family are membrane-anchored proteases that are able to cleave the extracellular domains of several membrane-bound proteins in a process known as 'ectodomain shedding'. In the central nervous system, ADAM10 has attracted the most attention, since it was described as the amyloid precursor protein α-secretase over ten years ago. Despite the excitement over the potential of ADAM10 as a novel drug target in Alzheimer disease, the physiological functions of ADAM10 in the brain are not yet well understood. This is largely because of the embryonic lethality of ADAM10-deficient mice, which results from the loss of cleavage and signaling of the Notch receptor, another ADAM10 substrate. However, the recent generation of conditional ADAM10-deficient mice and the identification of further ADAM10 substrates in the brain has revealed surprisingly numerous and fundamental functions of ADAM10 in the development of the embryonic brain and also in the homeostasis of adult neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ADAM10 controls these functions by utilizing unique postsynaptic substrates in the central nervous system, in particular synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as neuroligin-1, N-cadherin, NCAM, Ephrin A2 and A5. Consequently, a dysregulation of ADAM10 activity is linked to psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease. This review highlights the recent progress in understanding the substrates and function as well as the regulation and cell biology of ADAM10 in the central nervous system and discusses the value of ADAM10 as a drug target in brain diseases.","Brain has exceptional high requirement for energy metabolism with glucose as the exclusive energy source. Decrease of brain energy metabolism and glucose uptake has been found in patients of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases, providing a clear link between neurodegenerative disorders and energy metabolism. On the other hand, cancers, including glioblastoma, have increased glucose uptake and rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. The switch of high efficient oxidative phosphorylation to low efficient aerobic glycolysis pathway (Warburg effect) provides macromolecule for biosynthesis and proliferation. Current research indicates that methylene blue, a century old drug, can receive electron from NADH in the presence of complex I and donates it to cytochrome c, providing an alternative electron transfer pathway. Methylene blue increases oxygen consumption, decrease glycolysis, and increases glucose uptake in vitro. Methylene blue enhances glucose uptake and regional cerebral blood flow in rats upon acute treatment. In addition, methylene blue provides protective effect in neuron and astrocyte against various insults in vitro and in rodent models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. In glioblastoma cells, methylene blue reverses Warburg effect by enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, arrests glioma cell cycle at s-phase, and inhibits glioma cell proliferation. Accordingly, methylene blue activates AMP-activated protein kinase, inhibits downstream acetyl-coA carboxylase and cyclin-dependent kinases. In summary, there is accumulating evidence providing a proof of concept that enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via alternative mitochondrial electron transfer may offer protective action against neurodegenerative diseases and inhibit cancers proliferation.","Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of midbrain nigral dopaminergic neurons. Although its etiology remains unknown, the pathological role of several factors has been highlighted, namely oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and mitochondrial dysfunction, in addition to genetic predispositions. The current therapy is mainly symptomatic with l-DOPA aiming to replace dopamine. Novel therapeutic approaches are being investigated with the intention of influencing pathways leading to neuronal death and dysfunction. The present review summarizes three novel approaches, the use of which is promising in pre-clinical studies. Polyphenols have been shown to possess neuroprotective properties on account of their well-established antioxidative and anti-inflammatory actions but also due to their influence on protein misfolding and mitochondrial homeostasis. Within the amazing ancillary effects of antibiotics, their neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes are of great interest for the development of effective therapies against Parkinson's disease. Experimental evidence supports the potential of antibiotics as neuroprotective agents, being useful not only to prevent the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers but also to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Neuropeptides offer another approach with their diverse effects in the nervous system. Among them, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, a member of the secretin/glucagon superfamily, has several advantageous effects in models of neurodegeneration, namely anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, the combination of which offers a potent protective effect in dopaminergic neurons. Owing to their pleiotropic modes of action, these novel therapeutic candidates have potential in tackling the multidimensional features of Parkinson's disease.","Although sensory processing challenges have been noted since the first clinical descriptions of autism, it has taken until the release of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013 for sensory problems to be included as part of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the diagnostic profile. Because sensory information forms the building blocks for higher-order social and cognitive functions, we argue that sensory processing is not only an additional piece of the puzzle, but rather a critical cornerstone for characterizing and understanding ASD. In this review we discuss what is currently known about sensory processing in ASD, how sensory function fits within contemporary models of ASD, and what is understood about the differences in the underlying neural processing of sensory and social communication observed between individuals with and without ASD. In addition to highlighting the sensory features associated with ASD, we also emphasize the importance of multisensory processing in building perceptual and cognitive representations, and how deficits in multisensory integration may also be a core characteristic of ASD.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that shows progressive extrapyramidal motor disorders (e.g., bradykinesia, resting tremors, muscle rigidity and postural instability) and various non-motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, mood disorders, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders). While dopaminergic agents such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine D2 agonists are widely used for the treatment of PD, there is still high clinical unmet need for novel medications that overcome the limitations of current therapies. Evidence is now accumulating that the serotonergic nervous system is involved in the pathophysiological basis of PD and can provide benefits in the treatment of PD through its diverse functions. Among 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors play an important role in modulating extrapyramidal motor disorders. In addition, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors are implicated in modulation of cognitive impairment, mood disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety) and/or psychosis, which are frequently observed in patients with PD. Specifically, stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors seems to be effective for multiple PD symptoms including parkinsonism, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, cognitive impairment, mood disorders and neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons. Blockade of 5-HT2 receptors is also likely to improve parkinsonism, depressive mood and cognitive impairment. In addition, it was recently demonstrated that 5-HT2A inverse agonists can alleviate PD psychosis. All these findings emphasize the therapeutic roles of the serotonergic system in PD and stimulate new insight into novel treatments by modulating 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors.","Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) have long been studied as particularly accessible examples of chemical synapses. Nonetheless, some important features of neuromuscular transmission are still poorly understood. One of these is the low statistical variability of the number of transmitter quanta released from motor nerve terminals by successive nerve impulses. This variability is well-described by a binomial distribution, suggesting that the quanta released are drawn, at high probability, from a small subset of those in the terminals. However, the nature of that subset remains unclear. In an effort to clarify what is understood, and what is not, about quantal release at NMJs, this review addresses the relationship between NMJ structure and function. After setting the biological context in which NMJs operate, key aspects of the variability of release and the structure of the motor nerve terminals are described. These descriptions are then used to explore the functional logic of motor nerve terminal organization and the structural basis of the low variability of release. This analysis supports the suggestion that the probability of release differs significantly at the different 'active zones' from which quanta are released. Finally, after a brief consideration of how release is maintained in the long term, a comparison is made of the features of NMJs with those of some well-studied neuronal synapses. An important conclusion is that NMJs share some important features with neuronal synapses, so continuing efforts to understand how motor nerve terminals work are likely to have much more general implications.","Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have attracted much attention since their regulatory roles in diverse cell processes were recognized. Emerging studies demonstrate that many ncRNAs are differentially expressed after injury to the nervous system, significantly affecting nerve regeneration. In this review, we compile the miRNAs and lncRNAs that have been reported to be dysregulated following a variety of central and peripheral nerve injuries, including acquired brain injury, spinal cord injury, and peripheral nerve injury. We also list investigations on how these miRNAs and lncRNAs exert the regulatory actions in neurodegenerative and neuroregenerative processes through different mechanisms involving their interaction with target coding genes. We believe that comprehension of the expression profiles and the possible functions of ncRNAs during the processes of nerve injury and regeneration will help understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for post-nerve-injury changes, and may contribute to the potential use of ncRNAs as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for nerve injury.","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with other brain areas are crucial for cognitive function. Cognitive impairments are one of the core symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and manifest even before the onset of the disorder. Altered neural networks involving PFC contribute to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Both genetic and environmental risk factors affect the development of the local circuitry within PFC as well as development of broader brain networks, and make the system vulnerable to further insults during adolescence, leading to the onset of the disorder in young adulthood. Since spared cognitive functions correlate with functional outcome and prognosis, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments will have important implications for novel therapeutics for schizophrenia focusing on cognitive functions. Multidisciplinary approaches, from basic neuroscience to clinical studies, are required to link molecules, circuitry, networks, and behavioral phenotypes. Close interactions among such fields by sharing a common language on connectomes, behavioral readouts, and other concepts are crucial for this goal.","Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are two novel cell sources for studying neurodegenerative diseases. Dopaminergic neurons derived from hiPSCs/hESCs have been implicated to be very useful in Parkinson's disease (PD) research, including cell replacement therapy, disease modeling and drug screening. Recently, great efforts have been made to improve the application of hiPSCs/hESCs in PD research. Considerable advances have been made in recent years, including advanced reprogramming strategies without the use of viruses or using fewer transcriptional factors, optimized methods for generating highly homogeneous neural progenitors with a larger proportion of mature dopaminergic neurons and better survival and integration after transplantation. Here we outline the progress that has been made in these aspects in recent years, particularly during the last year, and also discuss existing issues that need to be addressed.","This review summarises genetic studies in which calcium channel genes have been connected to the spectrum of neuropsychiatric syndromes, from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to autism spectrum disorders and intellectual impairment. Among many other genes, striking numbers of the calcium channel gene superfamily have been implicated in the aetiology of these diseases by various DNA analysis techniques. We will discuss how these relate to the known monogenic disorders associated with point mutations in calcium channels. We will then examine the functional evidence for a causative link between these mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms and the disease processes. A major challenge for the future will be to translate the expanding psychiatric genetic findings into altered physiological function, involvement in the wider pathology of the diseases, and what potential that provides for personalised and stratified treatment options for patients.","We review a theory of homeostatic regulation and adaptive behavioural control within the Active Inference framework. Our aim is to connect two research streams that are usually considered independently; namely, Active Inference and associative learning theories of animal behaviour. The former uses a probabilistic (Bayesian) formulation of perception and action, while the latter calls on multiple (Pavlovian, habitual, goal-directed) processes for homeostatic and behavioural control. We offer a synthesis these classical processes and cast them as successive hierarchical contextualisations of sensorimotor constructs, using the generative models that underpin Active Inference. This dissolves any apparent mechanistic distinction between the optimization processes that mediate classical control or learning. Furthermore, we generalize the scope of Active Inference by emphasizing interoceptive inference and homeostatic regulation. The ensuing homeostatic (or allostatic) perspective provides an intuitive explanation for how priors act as drives or goals to enslave action, and emphasises the embodied nature of inference.","Removal from receptors of neurotransmitters just released into synapses is one of the major steps in neurotransmission. Transporters situated on the plasma membrane of nerve endings and glial cells perform the process of neurotransmitter (re)uptake. Because the density of transporters in the membranes can fluctuate, transporters can determine the transmitter concentrations at receptors, thus modulating indirectly the excitability of neighboring neurons. Evidence is accumulating that neurotransmitter transporters can exhibit multiple functions. Being bidirectional, neurotransmitter transporters can mediate transmitter release by working in reverse, most often under pathological conditions that cause ionic gradient dysregulations. Some transporters reverse to release transmitters, like dopamine or serotonin, when activated by 'indirectly acting' substrates, like the amphetamines. Some transporters exhibit as one major function the ability to capture transmitters into nerve terminals that perform insufficient synthesis. Transporter activation can generate conductances that regulate directly neuronal excitability. Synaptic and non-synaptic transporters play different roles. Cytosolic Na(+) elevations accompanying transport can interact with plasmalemmal or/and mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers thus generating calcium signals. Finally, neurotransmitter transporters can behave as receptors mediating releasing stimuli able to cause transmitter efflux through multiple mechanisms. Neurotransmitter transporters are therefore likely to play hitherto unknown roles in multiple therapeutic treatments.","It is now well established that many of society's most devastating and costly neurological diseases and disorders arise from trauma at, or shortly after birth. In some cases deficits are seen in childhood and in others they are substantially delayed; arising in adolescence or young adulthood. In either case the initial insult initiates a metabolic and/or neurodegenerative cascade that proceeds, often undetected, for a considerable period of time before diagnosable symptoms appear. This affords a potential for detecting and slowing or arresting degenerative and/or malfunctioning processes prior to the appearance of symptoms, but requires an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the progressive dysfunction that characterizes the disease progression process. While numerous preclinical models of end-stage symptoms of neurological disease are established, animal models of progressive neurological dysfunction have received comparatively less attention. This review attempts to introduce the concept of modelling progressive dysfunction in animals and provides descriptions of the current status of several representative examples of models that have been developed and partially characterized for understanding diseases of the brain that arise either at or near the time of birth in rodents. It is our belief that such models are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for progressive neurological dysfunction and hold the potential for identifying targets for early detection and presymptomatic therapy of these conditions.","Amphetamine-related drugs, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH), are popular recreational psychostimulants. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that, besides having the potential for abuse, amphetamine-related drugs may also elicit neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects. The neurotoxic potentials of MDMA and METH to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons have been clearly demonstrated in both rodents and non-human primates. This review summarizes the species-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in MDMA and METH-mediated neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects, along with the most important behavioral changes elicited by these substances in experimental animals and humans. Emphasis is placed on the neuropsychological and neurological consequences associated with the neuronal damage. Moreover, we point out the gap in our knowledge and the need for developing appropriate therapeutic strategies to manage the neurological problems associated with amphetamine-related drug abuse.","There are several interrelated mechanisms involving iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin in neurons. Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus, the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron, however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact, increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however, excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin, and this process rescues the cell. Interestingly, the main iron compound in dopamine and norepinephrine neurons is the neuromelanin-iron complex, since neuromelanin is an effective metal chelator. Neuromelanin serves to trap iron and provide neuronal protection from oxidative stress. This equilibrium between iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin is crucial for cell homeostasis and in some cellular circumstances can be disrupted. Indeed, when neuromelanin-containing organelles accumulate high load of toxins and iron during aging a neurodegenerative process can be triggered. In addition, neuromelanin released by degenerating neurons activates microglia and the latter cause neurons death with further release of neuromelanin, then starting a self-propelling mechanism of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Considering the above issues, age-related accumulation of neuromelanin in dopamine neurons shows an interesting link between aging and neurodegeneration.","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used as a treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor for over twenty years, and is a promising treatment for depression and epilepsy. However, the exact mechanisms of action of DBS are still uncertain, although different theories have emerged. This review summarizes the current understanding in this field. Different modalities used to investigate DBS such as electrophysiological, imaging and biochemical studies have revealed different mechanisms of DBS. The mechanisms may also be different depending on the structure targeted, the disease condition or the animal model employed. DBS may inhibit the target neuronal networks but activate the efferent axons. It may suppress pathological rhythms or impose new rhythms associated with beneficial effects, and involves neuronal networks with widespread connections. Different neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and GABA upregulation are involved in the effects of DBS. There are also technical advances to prolong the battery life and specific targeting based on new electrode designs with multiple contacts which have the ability to steer the current toward a specific direction. There is ongoing work in closed loop or adaptive DBS using neural oscillations to provide the feedback signals. These oscillations need to be better characterized in a wide variety of clinical settings in future studies. Individualization of DBS parameters based on neural oscillations may optimize the clinical benefits of DBS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motoneurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis, and finally death. Considerable recent advances have been made in basic research and preclinical therapeutic attempts using experimental models, leading to increasing clinical and translational research in the context of this disease. In this review we aim to summarize the most relevant findings from a variety of aspects about ALS, including evaluation methods, animal models, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, with particular emphasis in understanding the role of every contributing mechanism to the disease for elucidating the causes underlying degeneration of motoneurons and the development of new therapeutic strategies.","Involuntary movements, or dyskinesia, represent a debilitating complication of levodopa (L-dopa) therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) are ultimately experienced by the vast majority of patients. In addition, psychiatric conditions often manifested as compulsive behaviours, are emerging as a serious problem in the management of L-dopa therapy. The present review attempts to provide an overview of our current understanding of dyskinesia and other L-dopa-induced dysfunctions, a field that dramatically evolved in the past twenty years. In view of the extensive literature on LID, there appeared a critical need to re-frame the concepts, to highlight the most suitable models, to review the central nervous system (CNS) circuitry that may be involved, and to propose a pathophysiological framework was timely and necessary. An updated review to clarify our understanding of LID and other L-dopa-related side effects was therefore timely and necessary. This review should help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the generation of dyskinetic symptoms.","Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (Zeb) 2 is a transcription factor, identified due its ability to bind Smad proteins, and consists of multiple functional domains which interact with a variety of transcriptional co-effectors. The complex nature of the Zeb2, both at its genetic and protein levels, underlie its multifunctional properties, with Zeb2 capable of acting individually or as part of a transcriptional complex to repress, and occasionally activate, target gene expression. This review introduces Zeb2 as an essential regulator of nervous system development. Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, mutation of Zeb2 has dramatic neurological consequences both in animal models, and in humans with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which results from heterozygous ZEB2 mutations. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates the induction of the neuroectoderm (CNS primordium) and the neural crest (PNS primordium) are reviewed herein. We then describe how Zeb2 acts to direct the formation, delamination, migration and specification of neural crest cells. Zeb2 regulation of the development of a number of cerebral regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, are then described. The diverse molecular mechanisms mediating Zeb2-directed development of various neuronal and glial populations are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in spinal cord and enteric nervous system development is outlined, while its essential function in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review discusses how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2 mutant mice delineate the developmental dysfunctions underpinning the multiple neurological defects observed in Mowat-Wilson syndrome patients.","Attention is a means of flexibly selecting and enhancing a subset of sensory input based on the current behavioral goals. Numerous signatures of attention have been identified throughout the brain, and now experimenters are seeking to determine which of these signatures are causally related to the behavioral benefits of attention, and the source of these modulations within the brain. Here, we review the neural signatures of attention throughout the brain, their theoretical benefits for visual processing, and their experimental correlations with behavioral performance. We discuss the importance of measuring cue benefits as a way to distinguish between impairments on an attention task, which may instead be visual or motor impairments, and true attentional deficits. We examine evidence for various areas proposed as sources of attentional modulation within the brain, with a focus on the prefrontal cortex. Lastly, we look at studies that aim to link sources of attention to its neuronal signatures elsewhere in the brain.","CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) β and C/EBPδ are transcription factors of the basic-leucine zipper class which share phylogenetic, structural and functional features. In this review we first describe in depth their basic molecular biology which includes fascinating aspects such as the regulated use of alternative initiation codons in the C/EBPβ mRNA. The physical interactions with multiple transcription factors which greatly opens the number of potentially regulated genes or the presence of at least five different types of post-translational modifications are also remarkable molecular mechanisms that modulate C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ function. In the second part, we review the present knowledge on the localization, expression changes and physiological roles of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. We conclude that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ share two unique features related to their role in the CNS: whereas in neurons they participate in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, in glial cells they regulate the pro-inflammatory program. Because of their role in neuroinflammation, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in microglia are potential targets for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Any strategy to reduce C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ activity in neuroinflammation needs to take into account its potential side-effects in neurons. Therefore, cell-specific treatments will be required for the successful application of this strategy.","Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, SCA3), an autosomal dominant neurological disorder, is caused by an abnormal expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the ataxin-3 protein. The length of the expanded polyQ stretch correlates positively with the severity of the disease and inversely with the age at onset. To date, we cannot fully explain the mechanism underlying neurobiological abnormalities of this disease. Yet, accumulating reports have demonstrated the functions of ataxin-3 protein in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, all of which suggest a role of ataxin-3 in the clearance of misfolded proteins. Notably, the SCA3 pathogenic form of ataxin-3 (ataxin-3(exp)) impairs the misfolded protein clearance via mechanisms that are either dependent or independent of its deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the progressive loss of neurons in SCA3. Some drugs, which have been used as activators/inducers in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the relief of neurodegeneration diseases like Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD) as well as SCA3 in animal models and clinical trials, putting misfolded protein clearance on the list of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we undertake a comprehensive review of the progress in understanding the physiological functions of ataxin-3 in misfolded protein clearance and how the polyQ expansion impairs misfolded protein clearance. We then detail the preclinical studies targeting the elimination of misfolded proteins for SCA3 treatment. We close with future considerations for translating these pre-clinical results into therapies for SCA3 patients.","Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute-phase protein that, by binding to iron-loaded siderophores, acts as a potent bacteriostatic agent in the iron-depletion strategy of the immune system to control pathogens. The recent identification of a mammalian siderophore also suggests a physiological role for LCN2 in iron homeostasis, specifically in iron delivery to cells via a transferrin-independent mechanism. LCN2 participates, as well, in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis, and has been mostly found up-regulated in various tissues and under inflammatory states, being its expression regulated by several inducers. In the central nervous system less is known about the processes involving LCN2, namely by which cells it is produced/secreted, and its impact on cell proliferation and death, or in neuronal plasticity and behaviour. Importantly, LCN2 recently emerged as a potential clinical biomarker in multiple sclerosis and in ageing-related cognitive decline. Still, there are conflicting views on the role of LCN2 in pathophysiological processes, with some studies pointing to its neurodeleterious effects, while others indicate neuroprotection. Herein, these various perspectives are reviewed and a comprehensive and cohesive view of the general function of LCN2, particularly in the brain, is provided.","Due to a prolonged life expectancy worldwide, the incidence of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as glaucoma is increasing. Glaucoma is the second cause of blindness, resulting from a slow and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Up to now, intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction is the only treatment modality by which ophthalmologists attempt to control disease progression. However, not all patients benefit from this therapy, and the pathophysiology of glaucoma is not always associated with an elevated IOP. These limitations, together with the multifactorial etiology of glaucoma, urge the pressing medical need for novel and alternative treatment strategies. Such new therapies should focus on preventing or retarding RGC death, but also on repair of injured axons, to ultimately preserve or improve structural and functional connectivity. In this respect, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors hold a promising potential to become very prominent drugs for future glaucoma treatment. Their field of action in the eye does not seem to be restricted to IOP reduction by targeting the trabecular meshwork or improving filtration surgery outcome. Indeed, over the past years, important progress has been made in elucidating their ability to improve ocular blood flow, to prevent RGC death/increase RGC survival and to retard axonal degeneration or induce proper axonal regeneration. Within this review, we aim to highlight the currently known capacity of ROCK inhibition to promote neuroprotection and regeneration in several in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experimental glaucoma models.","The current trend of peripheral nerve tissue engineering is the design of advanced nerve guidance channels (NGCs) acting as physical guidance for regeneration of nerves across lesions. NGCs should present multifunctional properties aiming to direct the sprouting of axons from the proximal nerve end, to concentrate growth factors secreted by the injured nerve ends, and to reduce the ingrowth of scar tissue into the injury site. A critical aspect in the design of NGCs is conferring them the ability to provide topographic, chemotactic and haptotactic cues that lead to functional nerve regeneration thus increasing the axon growth rate and avoiding or minimizing end-organ (e.g. muscle) atrophy. The present work reviews the recent state of the art in NGCs engineering and defines the external guide and internal fillers structural and compositional requirements that should be satisfied to improve nerve regeneration, especially in the case of large gaps (>2 cm). Techniques for NGCs fabrication were described highlighting the innovative approaches direct to enhance the regeneration of axon stumps compared to current clinical treatments. Furthermore, the possibility to apply stem cells as internal cues to the NGCs was discussed focusing on scaffold properties necessary to ensure cell survival. Finally, the optimized features for NGCs design were summarized showing as multifunctional cues are needed to produce NGCs having improved results in clinics.","Epigenetics is a quickly growing field encompassing mechanisms regulating gene expression that do not involve changes in the genotype. Epigenetics is of increasing relevance to neuroscience, with epigenetic mechanisms being implicated in brain development and neuronal differentiation, as well as in more dynamic processes related to cognition. Epigenetic regulation covers multiple levels of gene expression; from direct modifications of the DNA and histone tails, regulating the level of transcription, to interactions with messenger RNAs, regulating the level of translation. Importantly, epigenetic dysregulation currently garners much attention as a pivotal player in aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, where it may mediate interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors, or directly interact with disease-specific pathological factors. We review current knowledge about the major epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and DNA demethylation, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs, as well as the involvement of these mechanisms in normal aging and in the pathophysiology of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we examine the current state of epigenetics-based therapeutic strategies for these diseases, which either aim to restore the epigenetic homeostasis or skew it to a favorable direction to counter disease pathology. Finally, methodological challenges of epigenetic investigations and future perspectives are discussed.","Macrophages are important players in the fight against viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections. From a resting state they may undertake two activation pathways, the classical known as M1, or the alternative known as M2. M1 markers are mostly mediators of pro-inflammatory responses whereas M2 markers emerge for resolution and cleanup. Microglia exerts in the central nervous system (CNS) a function similar to that of macrophages in the periphery. Microglia activation and proliferation occurs in almost any single pathology affecting the CNS. Often microglia activation has been considered detrimental and drugs able to stop microglia activation were considered for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Cumulative evidence shows that microglia may undergo the alternative activation pathway, express M2-type markers and contribute to neuroprotection. This review focuses on details about the role of M2 microglia and in the approaches available for its identification. Approaches to drive the M2 phenotype and data on its potential in CNS diseases are also reviewed.","The amyloid cascade hypothesis for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was proposed over twenty years ago. However, the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and synaptic loss have remained elusive delaying the effective drug discovery. Recent studies have revealed that amyloid-β peptides as well as phosphorylated and fragmented tau proteins accumulate within mitochondria. This process triggers mitochondrial fission (fragmentation) and disturbs Krebs cycle function e.g. by inhibiting the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Oxidative stress, hypoxia and calcium imbalance also disrupt the function of Krebs cycle in AD brains. Recent studies on epigenetic regulation have revealed that Krebs cycle intermediates control DNA and histone methylation as well as histone acetylation and thus they have fundamental roles in gene expression. DNA demethylases (TET1-3) and histone lysine demethylases (KDM2-7) are included in the family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (2-OGDO). Interestingly, 2-oxoglutarate is the obligatory substrate of 2-OGDO enzymes, whereas succinate and fumarate are the inhibitors of these enzymes. Moreover, citrate can stimulate histone acetylation via acetyl-CoA production. Epigenetic studies have revealed that AD is associated with changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns. However, the epigenetic results of different studies are inconsistent but one possibility is that they represent both coordinated adaptive responses and uncontrolled stochastic changes, which provoke pathogenesis in affected neurons. Here, we will review the changes observed in mitochondrial dynamics and Krebs cycle function associated with AD, and then clarify the mechanisms through which mitochondrial metabolites can control the epigenetic landscape of chromatin and induce pathological changes in AD.","Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that generate important health-related direct and indirect socio-economic costs. They are characterized by severe neuronal losses in several disease-specific brain regions associated with deposits of aggregated proteins. In Alzheimer's disease, β-amyloid peptide-containing plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau are the two main neuropathological lesions, while Parkinson's disease is defined by the presence of Lewy Bodies that are intraneuronal proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions. α-Synuclein has been identified as a major protein component of Lewy Bodies and heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In the past few years, evidence has emerged to explain how these aggregate-prone proteins can undergo spontaneous self-aggregation, propagate from cell to cell, and mediate neurotoxicity. Current research now indicates that oligomeric forms are probably the toxic species. This article discusses recent progress in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms of protein aggregation, and emphasizes the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms leading to cellular toxicity. Finally, we present the putative direct link between β-amyloid peptide and tau in causing toxicity in Alzheimer's disease as well as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, along with some of the most promising therapeutic strategies currently in development for those incurable neurodegenerative disorders.","During the last decade the what, where and when (WWWhen) episodic-like memory (ELM) task, which is based on the object recognition paradigm, has been utilized for the cognitive phenotyping of mouse mutants and transgenic mouse models of neuropsychiatric diseases. It was also widely used to identify the neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and pharmacological foundations of ELM formation, retention and retrieval. Findings from these studies have helped to increase our understanding of the neurobiology and neuropathology of episodic memory in the context of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Pharmacological studies identified novel targets that might facilitate episodic memory formation in patients with memory problems. In this review, we attempt to delineate the cognitive operations and processes that might underlie rodent performance in the WWWhen/ELM task. We discuss major issues of the object recognition paradigm, including the problem of familiarity vs. recollection-based object recognition, the problem of novel object-induced neophobia, and propose novel methodological solutions to these issues. In conclusion, the WWWhen/ELM task has proven to be a useful tool in the fields of behavioral and translational clinical neuroscience and has the potential to be further refined to address major problems in animal memory research.","Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience have led to the awareness that we should revise our traditional mode of thinking and studying the CNS, i.e. by isolating the privileged network of ""intelligent"" synaptic contacts. We may instead need to contemplate all the variegate communications occurring between the different neural cell types, and centrally involving the astrocytes. Basically, it appears that a single astrocyte should be considered as a core that receives and integrates information from thousands of synapses, other glial cells and the blood vessels. In turn, it generates complex outputs that control the neural circuitry and coordinate it with the local microcirculation. Astrocytes thus emerge as the possible fulcrum of the functional homeostasis of the healthy CNS. Yet, evidence indicates that the bridging properties of the astrocytes can change in parallel with, or as a result of, the morphological, biochemical and functional alterations these cells undergo upon injury or disease. As a consequence, they have the potential to transform from supportive friends and interactive partners for neurons into noxious foes. In this review, we summarize the currently available knowledge on the contribution of astrocytes to the functioning of the CNS and what goes wrong in various pathological conditions, with a particular focus on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease and ischemia. The observations described convincingly demonstrate that the development and progression of several neurological disorders involve the de-regulation of a finely tuned interplay between multiple cell populations. Thus, it seems that a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the integrated communication and detrimental responses of the astrocytes as well as their impact towards the homeostasis and performance of the CNS is fundamental to open novel therapeutic perspectives.","Understanding the developmental etiology of autistic spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia remains a major challenge for establishing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these common, difficult-to-treat diseases that compromise neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. One aspect of this challenge is the breadth and overlap of ASD, ADHD, and SCZ deficits; another is the complexity of mutations associated with each, and a third is the difficulty of analyzing disrupted development in at-risk or affected human fetuses. The identification of distinct genetic syndromes that include behavioral deficits similar to those in ASD, ADHC and SCZ provides a critical starting point for meeting this challenge. We summarize clinical and behavioral impairments in children and adults with one such genetic syndrome, the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, routinely called 22q11DS, caused by micro-deletions of between 1.5 and 3.0 MB on human chromosome 22. Among many syndromic features, including cardiovascular and craniofacial anomalies, 22q11DS patients have a high incidence of brain structural, functional, and behavioral deficits that reflect cerebral cortical dysfunction and fall within the spectrum that defines ASD, ADHD, and SCZ. We show that developmental pathogenesis underlying this apparent genetic ""model"" syndrome in patients can be defined and analyzed mechanistically using genomically accurate mouse models of the deletion that causes 22q11DS. We conclude that ""modeling a model"", in this case 22q11DS as a model for idiopathic ASD, ADHD and SCZ, as well as other behavioral disorders like anxiety frequently seen in 22q11DS patients, in genetically engineered mice provides a foundation for understanding the causes and improving diagnosis and therapy for these disorders of cortical circuit development.","The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in the processing and execution of motivated behaviors. Yet this brain region is often overlooked in published discussions of the neurobiology of mental health (e.g., addiction, depression). This contributes to a gap in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. This review is presented to help bridge the gap by providing a resource for current knowledge of VP anatomy, projection patterns and subregional circuits, and how this organization relates to the function of VP neurons and ultimately behavior. For example, ventromedial (VPvm) and dorsolateral (VPdl) VP subregions receive projections from nucleus accumbens shell and core, respectively. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the VPvm project to mediodorsal thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area, and this VP subregion helps discriminate the appropriate conditions to acquire natural rewards or drugs of abuse, consume preferred foods, and perform working memory tasks. GABAergic neurons of the VPdl project to subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and this VP subregion is modulated by, and is necessary for, drug-seeking behavior. Additional circuits arise from nonGABAergic neuronal phenotypes that are likely to excite rather than inhibit their targets. These subregional and neuronal phenotypic circuits place the VP in a unique position to process motivationally relevant stimuli and coherent adaptive behaviors.","Panic attacks (PAs), the core feature of panic disorder, represent a common phenomenon in the general adult population and are associated with a considerable decrease in quality of life and high health care costs. To date, the underlying pathophysiology of PAs is not well understood. A unique feature of PAs is that they represent a rare example of a psychopathological phenomenon that can be reliably modeled in the laboratory in panic disorder patients and healthy volunteers. The most effective techniques to experimentally trigger PAs are those that acutely disturb the acid-base homeostasis in the brain: inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2), hyperventilation, and lactate infusion. This review particularly focuses on the use of CO2 inhalation in humans and rodents as an experimental model of panic. Besides highlighting the different methodological approaches, the cardio-respiratory and the endocrine responses to CO2 inhalation are summarized. In addition, the relationships between CO2 level, changes in brain pH, the serotonergic system, and adaptive physiological and behavioral responses to CO2 exposure are presented. We aim to present an integrated psychological and neurobiological perspective. Remaining gaps in the literature and future perspectives are discussed.","Mounting evidence from clinical, epidemiological, neuropathology and preclinical studies indicates that mechanisms similar to those leading to peripheral metabolic deregulation in metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity, take place in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These include pro-inflammatory mechanisms, brain metabolic stress and neuronal insulin resistance. From a molecular and cellular perspective, recent progress has been made in unveiling novel pathways that act in an orchestrated way to cause neuronal damage and cognitive decline in AD. These pathways converge to the activation of neuronal stress-related protein kinases and excessive phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α-P), which plays a key role in control of protein translation, culminating in synapse dysfunction and memory loss. eIF2α-P signaling thus links multiple neuronal stress pathways to impaired neuronal function and neurodegeneration. Here, we present a critical analysis of recently discovered molecular mechanisms underlying impaired brain insulin signaling and metabolic stress, with emphasis on the role of stress kinase/eIF2α-P signaling as a hub that promotes brain and behavioral impairments in AD. Because very similar mechanisms appear to operate in peripheral metabolic deregulation in T2D and in brain defects in AD, we discuss the concept that targeting defective brain insulin signaling and neuronal stress mechanisms with anti-diabetes agents may be an attractive approach to fight memory decline in AD. We conclude by raising core questions that remain to be addressed toward the development of much needed therapeutic approaches for AD.","Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) represent a key link between electrical signals and non-electrical processes, such as contraction, secretion and transcription. Evolved to achieve high rates of Ca(2+)-selective flux, they possess an elaborate mechanism for selection of Ca(2+) over foreign ions. It has been convincingly linked to competitive binding in the pore, but the fundamental question of how this is reconcilable with high rates of Ca(2+) transfer remains unanswered. By virtue of their similarity to Ca(2+), polyvalent cations can interfere with the function of VGCCs and have proven instrumental in probing the mechanisms underlying selective permeation. Recent emergence of crystallographic data on a set of Ca(2+)-selective model channels provides a structural framework for permeation in VGCCs, and warrants a reconsideration of their diverse modulation by polyvalent cations, which can be roughly separated into three general mechanisms: (I) long-range interactions with charged regions on the surface, affecting the local potential sensed by the channel or influencing voltage-sensor movement by repulsive forces (electrostatic effects), (II) short-range interactions with sites in the ion-conducting pathway, leading to physical obstruction of the channel (pore block), and in some cases (III) short-range interactions with extracellular binding sites, leading to non-electrostatic modifications of channel gating (allosteric effects). These effects, together with the underlying molecular modifications, provide valuable insights into the function of VGCCs, and have important physiological and pathophysiological implications. Allosteric suppression of some of the pore-forming Cavα1-subunits (Cav2.3, Cav3.2) by Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) may play a major role for the regulation of excitability by endogenous transition metal ions. The fact that these ions can often traverse VGCCs can contribute to the detrimental intracellular accumulation of metal ions following excessive release of endogenous Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) or exposure to non-physiological toxic metal ions.","Complementary neuronal recordings in primates, and functional neuroimaging in humans, show that the primary taste cortex in the anterior insula provides separate and combined representations of the taste, temperature, and texture (including fat texture) of food in the mouth independently of hunger and thus of reward value and pleasantness. One synapse on, in a second tier of processing, in the orbitofrontal cortex, these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by associative learning with olfactory and visual inputs, and these neurons encode food reward value on a continuous scale in that they only respond to food when hungry, and in that activations correlate linearly with subjective pleasantness. Cognitive factors, including word-level descriptions, and selective attention to affective value, modulate the representation of the reward value of taste and olfactory stimuli in the orbitofrontal cortex and a region to which it projects, the anterior cingulate cortex, a tertiary taste cortical area. The food reward representations formed in this way play an important role in the control of appetite, and food intake. Individual differences in these reward representations may contribute to obesity, and there are age-related differences in these value representations that shape the foods that people in different age groups find palatable. In a third tier of processing in medial prefrontal cortex area 10, decisions between stimuli of different reward value are taken, by attractor decision-making networks.","Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common causes of chronic neurological disability beginning in early to middle adult life. Multiple sclerosis is idiopathic in nature, yet increasing correlative evidence supports a strong association between one's genetic predisposition, the environment and the immune system. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis have primarily been shown to result from a disruption in the integrity of myelinated tracts within the white matter of the central nervous system. However, recent research has also highlighted the hitherto underappreciated involvement of gray matter in multiple sclerosis disease pathophysiology, which may be especially relevant when considering the accumulation of irreversible damage and progressive disability. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the interplay between inflammation, glial/neuronal damage and regeneration throughout the course of multiple sclerosis via the analysis of both white and gray matter lesional pathology. Further, we describe the common pathological mechanisms underlying both relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, and analyze how current (as well as future) treatments may interact and/or interfere with its pathology. Understanding the putative mechanisms that drive disease pathogenesis will be key in helping to develop effective therapeutic strategies to prevent, mitigate, and treat the diverse morbidities associated with multiple sclerosis.","What makes us different from one another? Why does one person jump out of airplanes for fun while another prefers to stay home and read? Why are some babies born with a predisposition to become anxious? Questions about individual differences in temperament have engaged the minds of scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. Recent technological advances in neuroimaging and genetics provide an unprecedented opportunity to answer these questions. Here we review the literature on the neurobiology of one of the most basic individual differences-the tendency to approach or avoid novelty. This trait, called inhibited temperament, is innate, heritable, and observed across species. Importantly, inhibited temperament also confers risk for psychiatric disease. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of inhibited temperament, including neuroimaging and genetic studies in human and non-human primates. We conducted a meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings in inhibited humans that points to alterations in a fronto-limbic-basal ganglia circuit; these findings provide the basis of a model of inhibited temperament neurocircuitry. Lesion and neuroimaging studies in non-human primate models of inhibited temperament highlight roles for the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal prefrontal cortex. Genetic studies highlight a role for genes that regulate neurotransmitter function, such as the serotonin transporter polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR), as well as genes that regulate stress response, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Together these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the genetic and neural substrates of this most basic of temperament traits. Future studies using novel imaging methods and genetic approaches promise to expand upon these biological bases of inhibited temperament and inform our understanding of risk for psychiatric disease.","Melatonin is known to possess several properties of value for healthy aging, as a direct and indirect antioxidant, protectant and modulator of mitochondrial function, antiexcitotoxic agent, enhancer of circadian amplitudes, immune modulator and neuroprotectant. It is levels tend to decrease in the course of senescence and are more strongly reduced in several neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease, and in diseases related to insulin resistance such as diabetes type 2. Although the role of melatonin in aging and age-related diseases has been repeatedly discussed, the newly emerged concept of inflammaging, that is, the contribution of low-grade inflammation to senescence progression has not yet been the focus of melatonin research. This review addresses the multiple protective actions of melatonin and its kynuramine metabolites that are relevant to the attenuation of inflammatory responses and progression of inflammaging in the brain, i.e. avoidance of excitotoxicity, reduction of free radical formation by support of mitochondrial electron flux, prevention of NADPH oxidase activation and suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. The experimental evidence is primarily discussed on the basis of aging and senescence-accelerated animals, actions in the immune system, and the relationship between melatonin and sirtuins, having properties of aging suppressors. Sirtuins act either as accessory components or downstream factors of circadian oscillators, which are also under control by melatonin. Inflammaging is assumed to strongly contribute to neurodegeneration of the circadian master clock observed in advanced senescence and, even more, in Alzheimer's disease, a change that affects countless physiological functions.","Dystonia is a movement disorder of both genetic and non-genetic causes, which typically results in twisted posturing due to abnormal muscle contraction. Evidence from dystonia patients and animal models of dystonia indicate a crucial role for the striatal cholinergic system in the pathophysiology of dystonia. In this review, we focus on striatal circuitry and the centrality of the acetylcholine system in the function of the basal ganglia in the control of voluntary movement and ultimately clinical manifestation of movement disorders. We consider the impact of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) on dopamine-acetylcholine interactions and examine new evidence for impairment of ChIs in dysfunction of the motor systems producing dystonic movements, particularly in animal models. We have observed paradoxical excitation of ChIs in the presence of dopamine D2 receptor agonists and impairment of striatal synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia, which are improved by administration of recently developed M1 receptor antagonists. These findings have been confirmed across multiple animal models of DYT1 dystonia and may represent a common endophenotype by which to investigate dystonia induced by other types of genetic and non-genetic causes and to investigate the potential effectiveness of pharmacotherapeutics and other strategies to improve dystonia.","Even during moments when we fail to be fully aware of our environment, our brains never go silent. Instead, it appears that the brain can also operate in an alternate, unconscious mode. Delineating unconscious from conscious neural processes is a promising first step toward investigating how awareness emerges from brain activity. Here we focus on recent insights into the neuronal processes that contribute to visual function in the absence of a conscious visual percept. Drawing on insights from findings on the phenomenon of blindsight that results from injury to primary visual cortex and the results of experimentally induced perceptual suppression, we describe what kind of visual information the visual system analyzes unconsciously and we discuss the neuronal routing and responses that accompany this process. We conclude that unconscious processing of certain visual stimulus attributes, such as the presence of visual motion or the emotional expression of a face can occur in a geniculo-cortical circuit that runs independent from and in parallel to the predominant route through primary visual cortex. We speculate that in contrast, bidirectional neuronal interactions between cortex and the thalamic pulvinar nucleus that support large-scale neuronal integration and visual awareness are impeded during blindsight and perceptual suppression.","It is generally accepted that complex memories are stored in distributed representations throughout the brain, however the mechanisms underlying these representations are not understood. Here, we review recent findings regarding the subcellular mechanisms implicated in memory formation, which provide evidence for a dendrite-centered theory of memory. Plasticity-related phenomena which affect synaptic properties, such as synaptic tagging and capture, synaptic clustering, branch strength potentiation and spinogenesis provide the foundation for a model of memory storage that relies heavily on processes operating at the dendrite level. The emerging picture suggests that clusters of functionally related synapses may serve as key computational and memory storage units in the brain. We discuss both experimental evidence and theoretical models that support this hypothesis and explore its advantages for neuronal function.","Nervous system development, plasticity and regeneration require numerous, coordinated and finely tuned subcellular mechanisms. Phosphoproteins of the stathmin family, originally identified as intracellular signal relay proteins, are mostly or exclusively expressed in the nervous system with a high level of expression during brain development. Vertebrate stathmins 1-4 all possess a C-terminal ""stathmin-like domain"" that binds or releases tubulin in a phosphorylation dependent way, and hence participates in the control of microtubule dynamics, an essential process for neuronal differentiation. Contrary to stathmin 1, stathmins 2-4 possess an N-terminal extension whose reversible palmitoylation specifically targets them to the Golgi and intracellular membranes. Regulation of stathmins 2-4 palmitoylation is therefore an important regulatory mechanism that controls their shuttling to various neuronal compartments where they can then act locally. Expression of stathmins is upregulated during neuronal differentiation and plasticity, and altered in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental perturbation of stathmins expression in Drosophila or in neurons in culture revealed their importance in neuronal growth and differentiation, each stathmin fulfilling at least partially distinct and likely complementary roles. On the other hand, knock-out of stathmins in mice, with the exception of stathmin 2, resulted in mostly mild or no detected phenotype, revealing likely compensations among stathmins. Altogether, through their combinatorial expression and regulation by phosphorylation and by palmitoylation, and through their interactions with tubulin and other neuronal protein targets, the various stathmins appear as essential regulators of neuronal differentiation at the various stages during development and plasticity of the nervous system.","Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, is caused by a recessively inherited deficiency in glucocerebrosidase and subsequent accumulation of toxic lipid substrates. Heterozygous mutations in the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) have recently been recognized as the highest genetic risk factor for the development of α-synuclein aggregation disorders (""synucleinopathies""), including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Despite the wealth of experimental, clinical and genetic evidence that supports the association between mutant genotypes and synucleinopathy risk, the precise mechanisms by which GBA1 mutations lead to PD and DLB remain unclear. Decreased glucocerebrosidase activity has been demonstrated to promote α-synuclein misprocessing. Furthermore, aberrant α-synuclein species have been reported to downregulate glucocerebrosidase activity, which further contributes to disease progression. In this review, we summarize the recent findings that highlight the complexity of this pathogenetic link and how several pathways that connect glucocerebrosidase insufficiency with α-synuclein misprocessing have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. From a translational perspective, we discuss how various therapeutic approaches to lysosomal dysfunction have been explored for the treatment of GBA1-related synucleinopathies, and potentially, for non-GBA1-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, the link between GBA1 and synucleinopathies has become the paradigm of how the study of a rare lysosomal disease can transform the understanding of the etiopathology, and hopefully the treatment, of a more prevalent and multifactorial disorder.","There are currently more than 600 diseases characterized as affecting the central nervous system (CNS) which inflict neural damage. Unfortunately, few of these conditions have effective treatments available. Although significant efforts have been put into developing new therapeutics, drugs which were promising in the developmental phase have high attrition rates in late stage clinical trials. These failures could be circumvented if current 2D in vitro and in vivo models were improved. 3D, tissue-engineered in vitro systems can address this need and enhance clinical translation through two approaches: (1) bottom-up, and (2) top-down (developmental/regenerative) strategies to reproduce the structure and function of human tissues. Critical challenges remain including biomaterials capable of matching the mechanical properties and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of neural tissues, compartmentalized scaffolds that support heterogeneous tissue architectures reflective of brain organization and structure, and robust functional assays for in vitro tissue validation. The unique design parameters defined by the complex physiology of the CNS for construction and validation of 3D in vitro neural systems are reviewed here.","Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases are neurodegenerative diseases presently without effective drug treatments. AD is characterized by general cognitive impairment, difficulties with memory consolidation and retrieval, and with advanced stages episodes of agitation and anger. AD is increasing in frequency as life expectancy increases. Present FDA approved medications do little to slow disease progression and none address the underlying progressive loss of synaptic connections and neurons. New drug design approaches are needed beyond cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Patients with PD experience the symptomatic triad of bradykinesis, tremor-at-rest, and rigidity with the possibility of additional non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbances, depression, dementia, and autonomic nervous system failure. This review summarizes available information regarding the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in learning and memory and motor functions, with particular emphasis on research results suggesting a link between angiotensin IV (AngIV) interacting with the AT4 receptor subtype. Currently there is controversy over the identity of this AT4 receptor protein. Albiston and colleagues have offered convincing evidence that it is the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Recently members of our laboratory have presented evidence that the brain AngIV/AT4 receptor system coincides with the brain hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system. In an effort to resolve this issue we have synthesized a number of small molecule AngIV-based compounds that are metabolically stable, penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and facilitate compromised memory and motor systems. These research efforts are described along with details concerning a recently synthesized molecule, Dihexa that shows promise in overcoming memory and motor dysfunctions by augmenting synaptic connectivity via the formation of new functional synapses.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) encompass a range of syndromes that are characterized by social interaction impairments, verbal and nonverbal communication difficulties, and stereotypic or repetitive behaviours. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the changes in the 'social' and 'communicative' aspects of ASD, the neurofunctional architecture of repetitive and stereotypic behaviours, as well as other cognitive domains related to response and action control, remain poorly understood. Based on the findings of neurobiological and neuroanatomical alterations in ASD and the functional neuroanatomy and neurobiology of different action control functions, we emphasize that changes in action control processes, including response inhibition, conflict and response monitoring, task switching, dual-tasking, motor timing, and error monitoring, are important facets of ASD. These processes must be examined further to understand the executive control deficits in ASD that are related to stereotypic or repetitive behaviours as a major facet of ASD. The review shows that not all domains of action control are strongly affected in ASD. Several factors seem to determine the consistency with which alterations in cognitive control are reported. These factors relate to the relevance of neurobiological changes in ASD for the cognitive domains examined and in how far action control relies upon the adjustment of prior experience. Future directions and hypotheses are outlined that may guide basic and clinical research on action control in ASD.","Hypoxia is a major stress to the fetal development and may result in irreversible injury in the developing brain, increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the neonatal brain and long-term neurological complications in offspring. Current evidence indicates that epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the development of hypoxic/ischemic-sensitive phenotype in the developing brain in response to fetal stress. However, the causative cellular and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In the present review, we summarize the recent findings of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of the brain and their roles in fetal hypoxia-induced brain developmental malformations. Specifically, we focus on DNA methylation and active demethylation, histone modifications and microRNAs in the regulation of neuronal and vascular developmental plasticity, which may play a role in fetal stress-induced epigenetic programming of hypoxic/ischemic-sensitive phenotype in the developing brain.","Cigarette smoking is currently the leading cause of preventable deaths and disability throughout the world, being responsible for about five million premature deaths/year. Unfortunately, fewer than 10% of tobacco users who try to stop smoking actually manage to do so. The main addictive agent delivered by cigarette smoke is nicotine, which induces psychostimulation and reward, and reduces stress and anxiety. The use of new technologies (including optogenetics) and the development of mouse models characterised by cell-specific deletions of receptor subtype genes or the expression of gain-of-function nAChR subunits has greatly increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and neural substrates of nicotine addiction first revealed by classic electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioural approaches. It is now becoming clear that various aspects of nicotine dependence are mediated by close interactions of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic and γ-aminobutyric acidergic systems in the mesocorticolimbic system. This review is divided into two parts. The first provides an updated overview of the circuitry of the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, the neurotransmitter receptor subtypes expressed in these areas, and their physiological role in the mesocorticolimbic system. The second will focus on the molecular, functional and behavioural mechanisms involved in the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on the mesocorticolimbic system.","The impact of central nervous system (CNS) disorders on the human population is significant, contributing almost €800 billion in annual European healthcare costs. These disorders not only have a disabling social impact but also a crippling economic drain on resources. Developing novel therapeutic strategies for these disorders requires a better understanding of events that underlie mechanisms of neural circuit physiology. Studying the relationship between genetic expression, synapse development and circuit physiology in CNS function is a challenging task, involving simultaneous analysis of multiple parameters and the convergence of several disciplines and technological approaches. However, current gold-standard techniques used to study the CNS have limitations that pose unique challenges to furthering our understanding of functional CNS development. The recent advancement in nanotechnologies for biomedical applications has seen the emergence of nanoscience as a key enabling technology for delivering a translational bridge between basic and clinical research. In particular, the development of neuroimaging and electrophysiology tools to identify the aetiology and progression of CNS disorders have led to new insights in our understanding of CNS physiology and the development of novel diagnostic modalities for therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the latest applications of these nanotechnologies for investigating CNS function and the improved diagnosis of CNS disorders.","Subcortical brain structures of the limbic system, such as the amygdala, are thought to decode the emotional value of sensory information. Recent neuroimaging studies, as well as lesion studies in patients, have shown that the amygdala is sensitive to emotions in voice and music. Similarly, the hippocampus, another part of the temporal limbic system (TLS), is responsive to vocal and musical emotions, but its specific roles in emotional processing from music and especially from voices have been largely neglected. Here we review recent research on vocal and musical emotions, and outline commonalities and differences in the neural processing of emotions in the TLS in terms of emotional valence, emotional intensity and arousal, as well as in terms of acoustic and structural features of voices and music. We summarize the findings in a neural framework including several subcortical and cortical functional pathways between the auditory system and the TLS. This framework proposes that some vocal expressions might already receive a fast emotional evaluation via a subcortical pathway to the amygdala, whereas cortical pathways to the TLS are thought to be equally used for vocal and musical emotions. While the amygdala might be specifically involved in a coarse decoding of the emotional value of voices and music, the hippocampus might process more complex vocal and musical emotions, and might have an important role especially for the decoding of musical emotions by providing memory-based and contextual associations.","In human and nonhuman primates, the cortical motor system comprises a collection of brain areas primarily related to motor control. Existing evidence suggests that no other mammalian group has the number, extension, and complexity of motor-related areas observed in the frontal lobe of primates. Such diversity is probably related to the wide behavioral flexibility that primates display. Indeed, recent comparative anatomical, psychophysical, and neurophysiological studies suggest that the evolution of the motor cortical areas closely correlates with the emergence of high cognitive abilities. Advances in understanding the cortical motor system have shown that these areas are also related to functions previously linked to higher-order associative areas. In addition, experimental observations have shown that the classical distinction between perceptual and motor functions is not strictly followed across cortical areas. In this paper, we review evidence suggesting that evolution of the motor system had a role in the shaping of different cognitive functions in primates. We argue that the increase in the complexity of the motor system has contributed to the emergence of new abilities observed in human and nonhuman primates, including the recognition and imitation of the actions of others, speech perception and production, and the execution and appreciation of the rhythmic structure of music.","Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive and bipolar disorders are severe, chronic and debilitating, and are associated with high disease burden and healthcare costs. Currently, diagnoses of these disorders rely on interview-based assessments of subjective self-reported symptoms. Early diagnosis is difficult, misdiagnosis is a frequent occurrence and there are no objective tests that aid in the prediction of individual responses to treatment. Consequently, validated biomarkers are urgently needed to help address these unmet clinical needs. Historically, psychiatric disorders are viewed as brain disorders and consequently only a few researchers have as yet evaluated systemic changes in psychiatric patients. However, promising research has begun to challenge this concept and there is an increasing awareness that disease-related changes can be traced in the peripheral system which may even be involved in the precipitation of disease onset and course. Converging evidence from molecular profiling analysis of blood serum/plasma have revealed robust molecular changes in psychiatric patients, suggesting that these disorders may be detectable in other systems of the body such as the circulating blood. In this review, we discuss the current clinical needs in psychiatry, highlight the importance of biomarkers in the field, and review a representative selection of biomarker studies to highlight opportunities for the implementation of personalized medicine approaches in the field of psychiatry. It is anticipated that the implementation of validated biomarker tests will not only improve the diagnosis and more effective treatment of psychiatric patients, but also improve prognosis and disease outcome.","This document reviews the literature on local brain manipulation of general anesthesia in animals, focusing on behavioral and electrographic effects related to hypnosis or loss of consciousness. Local inactivation or lesion of wake-active areas, such as locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, perifornical area, tuberomammillary nucleus, ventral tegmental area and basal forebrain, enhanced general anesthesia. Anesthesia enhancement was shown as a delayed emergence (recovery of righting reflex) from anesthesia or a decrease in the minimal alveolar concentration that induced loss of righting. Local activation of various wake-active areas, including pontis oralis and centromedial thalamus, promoted behavioral or electrographic arousal during maintained anesthesia and facilitated emergence. Lesion of the sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic area resulted in increased wakefulness and decreased isoflurane sensitivity, but only for 6 days after lesion. Inactivation of any structure within limbic circuits involving the medial septum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area, amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortex delayed emergence from anesthesia, and often reduced anesthetic-induced behavioral excitation. In summary, the concept that anesthesia works on the sleep-wake system has received strong support from studies that inactivated/lesioned or activated wake-active areas, and weak support from studies that lesioned sleep-active areas. In addition to the conventional wake-sleep areas, limbic structures such as the medial septum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are also involved in the behavioral response to general anesthesia. We suggest that hypnosis during general anesthesia may result from disrupting the wake-active neuronal activities in multiple areas and suppressing an atropine-resistant cortical activation associated with movements.","Psychosocial and biological factors have been implicated in paedophilia, such as alterations in brain structure and function. The purpose of this paper is to review the expanding body of literature on this topic including brain abnormality case reports, as well as structural and functional neuroimaging studies. Case studies of men who have committed sexual offences against children implicate frontal and temporal abnormalities that may be associated with impaired impulse inhibition. Structural neuroimaging investigations show volume reductions in paedophilic men. Although the findings have been heterogeneous, smaller amygdala volume has been replicated repeatedly. Functional neuroimaging investigations demonstrate an overlap between paedophiles and teleiophiles during sexual arousal processing. While it is controversial among studies regarding group differences, reliable discrimination between paedophilic and teleiophilic men may be achieved using functional activation patterns. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous findings published so far suggest further research is necessary to disentangle the neurobiological mechanisms of paedophilic preference. A number of methodological confounds have been identified, which may account for the inconsistent results that could prove to be beneficial for future investigations.","Oxytocin (OT) plays a major role in the establishment of social bonds. Social bonds are linked to the activation of cell signaling pathways that promote neurotrophic and synaptic maturation, plasticity and memory changes. Anti-social behavior is often associated with abnormalities of cell signaling pathways and/or defective function of brain neurotransmitters within behavioral CNS circuits due to unproper environmental and social factors, such as, diet, stress, chemical, air pollution, and noise, during gestational period or/and during early postnatal development. OT exerts an important regulatory functions in maternity and parental behaviors, lactation, attachment, bonding, trust, and sensorial functions such as: homeostatic cardiovascular control, satiety, touch, pain, analgesia and sexual behavior. Noteworthy, OT displays important neuroprotective properties against fetal programmed hypertension when administered during early postnatal life, added to its known anabolic properties shown in adult rats, e.g. body weight control, reduces blood pressure, and increases analgesia. This review focuses on the new evidences supporting OT's role as a major neuroprotective nonapeptide provided by its quality to reverse hypertension programmed in utero by undernutrition.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 36 million people worldwide. AD is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive functions. For years, it has been thought that age is the main risk factor for AD. Recent studies suggest that life style factors, including nutritional behaviors, play a critical role in the onset of dementia. Evidence about the relationship between nutritional behavior and AD includes the role of conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and elevated glucose levels. The coexistence of some of these cardio-metabolic risk factors is generally known as metabolic syndrome (MS). Some clinical studies support the role of MS in the onset of AD. However, the cross-talk between the molecular signaling implicated in these disorders is unknown. In the present review, we focus on the molecular correlates that support the relationship between MS and the onset of AD. We also discuss relevant issues such as the role of leptin, insulin and renin-angiotensin signaling in the brain and the possible role of Wnt signaling in both MS and AD. We discuss the evidence supporting the use of ob/ob mice, high-fructose diets, aortic coarctation-induced hypertension and Octodon degus, which spontaneously develops β-amyloid deposits and metabolic derangements, as suitable animal models to address the relationships between MS and AD. Finally, we examine emergent data supporting the role of Wnt signaling in the modulation of AD and MS, implicating this pathway as a therapeutic target in both conditions.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs in ∼1-3% of the general population, and its often rather early onset causes major disabilities in the everyday lives of patients. Although the heritability of OCD is between 35 and 65%, many linkage, association, and genome-wide association studies have failed to identify single genes that exhibit high effect sizes. Several neuroimaging studies have revealed structural and functional alterations mainly in cortico-striato-thalamic loops. However, there is also marked heterogeneity across studies. These inconsistencies in genetic and neuroimaging studies may be due to the heterogeneous and complex phenotypes of OCD. Under the consideration that genetic variants may also influence neuroimaging in OCD, researchers have started to combine both domains in the field of imaging genetics. Here, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Google Scholar literature for articles that address genetic imaging in OCD and related disorders (published through March 2014). We selected 8 publications that describe the combination of imaging genetics with OCD, and extended it with 43 publications of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The most promising findings of this systematic review point to the involvement of variants in genes involved in the serotonergic (5-HTTLPR, HTR2A), dopaminergic (COMT, DAT), and glutamatergic (SLC1A1, SAPAP) systems. However, the field of imaging genetics must be further explored, best through investigations that combine multimodal imaging techniques with genetic profiling, particularly profiling techniques that employ polygenetic approaches, with much larger sample sizes than have been used up to now.","Investigations over the last two decades have made major inroads in clarifying the cellular and molecular events that underlie the fast, synchronous release of neurotransmitter at nerve endings. Thus, appreciable progress has been made in establishing the structural features and biophysical properties of the calcium (Ca2+) channels that mediate the entry into nerve endings of the Ca2+ ions that trigger neurotransmitter release. It is now clear that presynaptic Ca2+ channels are regulated at many levels and the interplay of these regulatory mechanisms is just beginning to be understood. At the same time, many lines of research have converged on the conclusion that members of the synaptotagmin family serve as the primary Ca2+ sensors for the action potential-dependent release of neurotransmitter. This identification of synaptotagmins as the proteins which bind Ca2+ and initiate the exocytotic fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane has spurred widespread efforts to reveal molecular details of synaptotagmin's action. Currently, most models propose that synaptotagmin interfaces directly or indirectly with SNARE (soluble, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment receptors) proteins to trigger membrane fusion. However, in spite of intensive efforts, the field has not achieved consensus on the mechanism by which synaptotagmins act. Concurrently, the precise sequence of steps underlying SNARE-dependent membrane fusion remains controversial. This review considers the pros and cons of the different models of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and concludes by discussing a novel proposal in which synaptotagmins might directly elicit membrane fusion without the intervention of SNARE proteins in this final fusion step.","Animal models are pivotal for studies of pathogenesis and treatment of disorders of the central nervous system which in its complexity cannot yet be modeled in vitro or using computer simulations. The choice of a specific model to test novel therapeutic strategies for a human disease should be based on validity of the model for the approach: does the model reflect symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment response present in human patients? In the movement disorder dystonia, prior to the availability of genetically engineered mice, spontaneous mutants were chosen based on expression of dystonic features, including abnormal muscle contraction, movements and postures. Recent discovery of a number of genes and gene products involved in dystonia initiated research on pathogenesis of the disorder, and the creation of novel models based on gene mutations. Here we present a review of current models of dystonia, with a focus on genetic rodent models, which will likely be first choice in the future either for pathophysiological or for preclinical drug testing or both. In order to help selection of a model depending on expression of a specific feature of dystonia, this review is organized by symptoms and current knowledge of pathogenesis of dystonia. We conclude that albeit there is increasing need for research on pathogenesis of the disease and development of improved models, current models do replicate features of dystonia and are useful tools to develop urgently demanded treatment for this debilitating disorder.","Today, neuroimaging techniques are frequently used to investigate the integration of functionally specialized brain regions in a network. Functional connectivity, which quantifies the statistical dependencies among the dynamics of simultaneously recorded signals, allows to infer the dynamical interactions of segregated brain regions. In this review we discuss how the functional connectivity patterns obtained from intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings reveal information about the dynamics of the epileptic brain and can be used to predict upcoming seizures and to localize the seizure onset zone. The added value of extracting information that is not visibly identifiable in the EEG data using functional connectivity analysis is stressed. Despite the fact that many studies have showed promising results, we must conclude that functional connectivity analysis has not made its way into clinical practice yet.","The cerebral vasculature has a unique role in providing a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to ensure normal brain functions. Blood vessels that feed the brain are far from being simply channels for passive transportation of fluids. They form complex structures made up of different cell types. These structures regulate blood supply, local concentrations of O2 and CO2, transport of small molecules, trafficking of plasma cells and fine cerebral functions in normal and diseased brains. Until few years ago, analysis of these functions has been typically based on post mortem techniques, whose interpretation is limited by the need for tissue processing at specific times. For a reliable and effective picture of the dynamic processes in the central nervous system, real-time information in vivo is required. There are now few in vivo systems, among which two-photon microscopy (2-PM) is a truly innovative tool for studying the brain. 2-PM has been used to dissect specific aspects of vascular and immune cell dynamics in the context of neurological diseases, providing exciting results that could not have been obtained with conventional methods. This review summarizes the latest findings on vascular and immune system action in the brain, with particular focus on the dynamic responses after ischemic brain injury. 2-PM has helped define the hierarchical architecture of the brain vasculature, the dynamic interaction between the vasculature and immune cells recruited to lesion sites, the effects of blood flow on neuronal and microglial activity and the ability of cells of the neurovascular unit to regulate blood flow.","The importance of the modulation of pain by emotion is now widely recognised. In particular, stress and anxiety, depending on their nature, duration and intensity, can exert potent, but complex, modulatory influences typified by either a reduction or exacerbation of the pain state. Exposure to either acute or chronic stress can increase pain responding under experimental conditions and exacerbate clinical pain disorders. There is evidence that exposure to chronic or repeated stress can produce maladaptive neurobiological changes in pathways associated with pain processing, resulting in stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH). Preclinical studies of SIH are essential for our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning stress-related pain syndromes and for the identification of neural pathways and substrates, and the development of novel therapeutic agents for their clinical management. In this review, we describe clinical and pre-clinical models used to study SIH and discuss the neural substrates, neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory systems involved in this phenomenon.","Serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, with their extensive innervation of limbic and higher brain regions and interactions with the endocrine system have important modulatory or regulatory effects on many cognitive, emotional and physiological processes. They have been strongly implicated in responses to stress and in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. In order to quantify some of these effects, detailed mathematical models of the activity of such cells are required which describe their complex neurochemistry and neurophysiology. We consider here a single-compartment model of these neurons which is capable of describing many of the known features of spike generation, particularly the slow rhythmic pacemaking activity often observed in these cells in a variety of species. Included in the model are 11 kinds of ion channels: a fast sodium current INa, a delayed rectifier potassium current IKDR, a transient potassium current IA, a slow non-inactivating potassium current IM, a low-threshold calcium current IT, two high threshold calcium currents IL and IN, small and large conductance potassium currents ISK and IBK, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current IH and a leak current ILeak. In Sections 3-8, each current type is considered in detail and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. Three kinds of model are considered for the BK current and two for the leak current. Intracellular calcium ion concentration Cai is an additional component and calcium dynamics along with buffering and pumping is discussed in Section 9. The remainder of the article contains descriptions of computed solutions which reveal both spontaneous and driven spiking with several parameter sets. Attention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons, particularly long duration of action potential, steep upslope on the leading edge of spikes, pacemaker-like spiking, long-lasting afterhyperpolarization and the ramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane potential trajectories display doublets or have humps or notches as have been reported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of IA and IT during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a competition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous activity was facilitated by the presence of IH which has been found in these neurons by some investigators. For reasonable sets of parameters spike frequencies between about 0.6Hz and 1.2Hz are obtained, but frequencies as high as 6Hz could be obtained with special parameter choices. Topics investigated and compared with experiment include shoulders, notches, anodal break phenomena, the effects of noradrenergic input, frequency versus current curves, depolarization block, effects of cell size and the effects of IM. The inhibitory effects of activating 5-HT1A autoreceptors are also investigated. There is a considerable discussion of in vitro versus in vivo firing behavior, with focus on the roles of noradrenergic input, corticotropin-releasing factor and orexinergic inputs. Location of cells within the nucleus is probably a major factor, along with the state of the animal.","Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are an etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders of neurodegenerative origin, which result in degeneration of lower (LMNs) and/or upper motor neurons (UMNs). Neurodegenerative MNDs include pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which involves specific degeneration of UMNs, leading to progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset MND, is characterized by the degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs, leading to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity. A review of the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and zebrafish motor systems showed that, while the zebrafish was a homologous model for LMN disorders, such as SMA, it was only partially relevant in the case of UMN disorders, due to the absence of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts in its central nervous system. Even considering the limitation of this model to fully reproduce the human UMN disorders, zebrafish offer an excellent alternative vertebrate model for the molecular and genetic dissection of MND mechanisms. Its advantages include the conservation of genome and physiological processes and applicable in vivo tools, including easy imaging, loss or gain of function methods, behavioral tests to examine changes in motor activity, and the ease of simultaneous chemical/drug testing on large numbers of animals. This facilitates the assessment of the environmental origin of MNDs, alone or in combination with genetic traits and putative modifier genes. Positive hits obtained by phenotype-based small-molecule screening using zebrafish may potentially be effective drugs for treatment of human MNDs.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain etiopathogenesis manifesting with autonomic failure, parkinsonism, and ataxia in any combination. The underlying neuropathology affects central autonomic, striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar pathways and it is associated with distinctive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs, Papp-Lantos bodies) that contain aggregates of α-synuclein. Current treatment options are very limited and mainly focused on symptomatic relief, whereas disease modifying options are lacking. Despite extensive testing, no neuroprotective drug treatment has been identified up to now; however, a neurorestorative approach utilizing autologous mesenchymal stem cells has shown remarkable beneficial effects in the cerebellar variant of MSA. Here, we review the progress made over the last decade in defining pathogenic targets in MSA and summarize insights gained from candidate disease-modifying interventions that have utilized a variety of well-established preclinical MSA models. We also discuss the current limitations that our field faces and suggest solutions for possible approaches in cause-directed therapies of MSA.","Insulin and Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) play a major role in body homeostasis and glucose regulation. They also have paracrine/autocrine functions in the brain. The Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway contributes to the control of neuronal excitability, nerve cell metabolism and cell survival. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), known as an insulinotropic hormone has similar functions and growth like properties as insulin/IGF-1. Growing evidence suggests that dysfunction of these pathways contribute to the progressive loss of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most frequent neurodegenerative disorders. These findings have led to numerous studies in preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders targeting insulin/IGF-1 and GLP-1 signaling with currently available anti-diabetics. These studies have shown that administration of insulin, IGF-1 and GLP-1 agonists reverses signaling abnormalities and has positive effects on surrogate markers of neurodegeneration and behavioral outcomes. Several proof-of-concept studies are underway that attempt to translate the encouraging preclinical results to patients suffering from AD and PD. In the first part of this review, we discuss physiological functions of insulin/IGF-1 and GLP-1 signaling pathways including downstream targets and receptors distribution within the brain. In the second part, we undertake a comprehensive overview of preclinical studies targeting insulin/IGF-1 or GLP-1 signaling for treating AD and PD. We then detail the design of clinical trials that have used anti-diabetics for treating AD and PD patients. We close with future considerations that treat relevant issues for successful translation of these encouraging preclinical results into treatments for patients with AD and PD.","After spinal cord injury (SCI) there is prolonged and dispersed oligodendrocyte cell death that is responsible for widespread demyelination. To regenerate this lost myelin, many investigators have transplanted myelin-producing cells as a treatment for contusive SCI. There are several documented examples of cellular transplantation improving function after injury, with the degree of myelin regeneration correlating with functional recovery. On the basis of these findings, remyelination is hypothesized to be a beneficial strategy to promote recovery after injury. As cellular transplantation is now entering clinical trials for treatment of SCI, it is important to dissect carefully whether accelerating remyelination after SCI is a valid clinical target. In this review we will discuss the consequences of demyelination and the potential benefits of remyelination as it relates to injury. Prolonged demyelination is hypothesized to enhance axonal vulnerability to degeneration, and is thereby thought to contribute to the axonal degeneration that underlies the permanent functional losses associated with SCI. Currently, strategies to promote remyelination after SCI are largely limited to cellular transplantation. This review discusses those strategies as well as new, and largely untested, modes of therapy that aim to coax endogenous cells residing adjacent to the injury site to differentiate in order to replace lost myelin.","What can be expected in normal aging, and where does normal aging stop and pathological neurodegeneration begin? With the slow progression of age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to distinguish age-related changes from effects of undetected disease. We review recent research on changes of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in aging and the borders between normal aging and AD. We argue that prominent cortical reductions are evident in fronto-temporal regions in elderly even with low probability of AD, including regions overlapping the default mode network. Importantly, these regions show high levels of amyloid deposition in AD, and are both structurally and functionally vulnerable early in the disease. This normalcy-pathology homology is critical to understand, since aging itself is the major risk factor for sporadic AD. Thus, rather than necessarily reflecting early signs of disease, these changes may be part of normal aging, and may inform on why the aging brain is so much more susceptible to AD than is the younger brain. We suggest that regions characterized by a high degree of life-long plasticity are vulnerable to detrimental effects of normal aging, and that this age-vulnerability renders them more susceptible to additional, pathological AD-related changes. We conclude that it will be difficult to understand AD without understanding why it preferably affects older brains, and that we need a model that accounts for age-related changes in AD-vulnerable regions independently of AD-pathology.","The candidate gene approach directly tests the effects of genetic variation within a potentially contributing gene in an association study. However, the candidate gene approach is limited by how much is known about the biology of the disease being investigated. The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has been studied more than any other single candidate gene in the field of neurobiology. Transcription of the serotonin transporter gene is modulated by a polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR, near the promoter. 5-HTTLPR genotype has been associated with individual variation in emotion processing, brain structure, and brain function. We present an updated review of the biological literature on the serotonin transporter polymorphism. Recent imaging and behavioral studies of the role of 5-HTTLPR genotype in emotion processing are discussed in light of new biological findings related to 5-HTTLPR variation. We also examine the clinical implications of discoveries about the role of serotonin and 5-HTTLPR genotype in neural plasticity and behavioral malleability.","The ability to efficiently store memories in the brain is a fundamental process and its impairment is associated with multiple human mental disorders. Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM) formation involves alterations of synaptic efficacy produced by modifications in neural transmission and morphology. The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be involved in these key neuronal processes by subserving events such as presynaptic vesicle movement, postsynaptic glutamate receptors trafficking and dendritic spines morphogenesis. Actin cytoskeleton dynamics and structure underlying such cellular events can be regulated by extracellular signals through its regulatory proteins. Recent findings show that the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins are needed for memory formation and extinction in different organisms throughout the phyla from invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila to mammalians. The actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins participate in the formation of various types of memories that are subserved by different neurons and brain regions. The actin cytoskeleton may therefore mediate between synaptic transmission during learning and long-term cellular alterations mandatory for memory formation.","Neuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported findings of activation in frontoparietal regions that largely overlap across various cognitive functions. Part of this frontoparietal activation has been interpreted as reflecting attentional mechanisms that can adaptively be directed towards external stimulation as well as internal representations (internal attention), thereby generating the experience of distinct cognitive functions. Nevertheless, findings of material- and task-specific activation in frontal and parietal regions challenge this internal attention hypothesis and have been used to support more modular hypotheses of cognitive function. The aim of this review is twofold: First, it discusses evidence in support of the concept of internal attention and the so-called dorsal attention network (DAN) as its neural source with respect to three cognitive functions (working memory, episodic retrieval, and mental imagery). While DAN activation in all three functions has been separately linked to internal attention, a comprehensive and integrative review has so far been lacking. Second, the review examines findings of material- and process-specific activation within frontoparietal regions, arguing that these results are well compatible with the internal attention account of frontoparietal activation. A new model of cognition is presented, proposing that supposedly different cognitive concepts actually rely on similar attentional network dynamics to maintain, reactivate and newly create internal representations of stimuli in various modalities. Attentional as well as representational mechanisms are assigned to frontal and parietal regions, positing that some regions are implicated in the allocation of attentional resources to perceptual or internal representations, but others are involved in the representational processes themselves.","Visual hallucinations are common across a number of disorders but to date, a unifying pathophysiology underlying these phenomena has not been described. In this manuscript, we combine insights from neuropathological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies to propose a testable common neural mechanism for visual hallucinations. We propose that 'simple' visual hallucinations arise from disturbances within regions responsible for the primary processing of visual information, however with no further modulation of perceptual content by attention. In contrast, 'complex' visual hallucinations reflect dysfunction within and between the Attentional Control Networks, leading to the inappropriate interpretation of ambiguous percepts. The incorrect information perceived by hallucinators is often differentially interpreted depending on the time-course and the neuroarchitecture underlying the interpretation. Disorders with 'complex' hallucinations without retained insight are proposed to be associated with a reduction in the activity within the Dorsal Attention Network. The review concludes by showing that a variety of pathological processes can ultimately manifest in any of these three categories, depending on the precise location of the impairment.","Affective disorders and cognitive deficits are common comorbidities of chronic pain in the clinical setting, which severely affect the quality of life of pain patients and impose a great difficulty upon clinical pain therapy. Despite large numbers of human studies examining this issue, there are surprisingly few reports investigating the comorbidities of chronic pain in animal models. This review summarizes and integrates previous reports of animal studies on pain and comorbidity, covering pain-evoked anxiety, depression, attentional deficits, cognitive impairment and locomotor dysfunction in rodents. Moreover, pain-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity are also discussed in terms of long-term potentiation and long-term depression, synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability and structural correlates in 'pain matrix'. Finally, we conclude this review by pointing out some unresolved problems and future research directions.","Copper is an important trace element that is required for essential enzymes. However, due to its redox activity, copper can also lead to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. Therefore, cellular uptake, storage as well as export of copper have to be tightly regulated in order to guarantee sufficient copper supply for the synthesis of copper-containing enzymes but also to prevent copper-induced oxidative stress. In brain, copper is of importance for normal development. In addition, both copper deficiency as well as excess of copper can seriously affect brain functions. Therefore, this organ possesses ample mechanisms to regulate its copper metabolism. In brain, astrocytes are considered as important regulators of copper homeostasis. Impairments of homeostatic mechanisms in brain copper metabolism have been associated with neurodegeneration in human disorders such as Menkes disease, Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This review article will summarize the biological functions of copper in the brain and will describe the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in copper transport, storage and export of brain cells. The role of copper in diseases that have been connected with disturbances in brain copper homeostasis will also be discussed.","Restoring neurological function to a damaged peripheral nerve separated by a gap requires axon regeneration (1) across the gap, no matter its length, and then (2) through the distal portion of the nerve, regardless of the time between the trauma and repair, and irrespective of animal or patient age. Sensory nerve grafts, the clinical ""gold standard"", and most alternative techniques for bridging nerve gaps, promote reliable axon regeneration only across nerve gaps <2cm in length, and with few axons regenerating when nerve repairs are performed >2 months post-trauma or for patients >20 years of age. Three novel nerve repair techniques are discussed that induce axon regeneration and neurological recovery clinically under conditions where other techniques are ineffective: for nerve gaps up to cm long, repairs performed as late as 3.25 years post-trauma, and for patients up to 58 years old. The mechanisms by which these techniques may work are discussed. Although these techniques provide significant improvements in the extents of axon regeneration and neurological recovery, more extensive and reliable clinical recovery of neurological function is needed and will probably require the simultaneous application of multiple techniques.","Ischemic brain injury results from complicated cellular mechanisms. The present therapy for acute ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolysis with the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and mechanical recanalization. Therefore, a better understanding of ischemic brain injury is needed for the development of more effective therapies. Disruption of ionic homeostasis plays an important role in cell death following cerebral ischemia. Glutamate receptor-mediated ionic imbalance and neurotoxicity have been well established in cerebral ischemia after stroke. However, non-NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms, involving acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1), have recently emerged as important players in the dysregulation of ionic homeostasis in the CNS under ischemic conditions. These H(+)-sensitive channels and/or exchangers are expressed in the majority of cell types of the neurovascular unit. Sustained activation of these proteins causes excessive influx of cations, such as Ca(2+), Na(+), and Zn(2+), and leads to ischemic reperfusion brain injury. In this review, we summarize recent pre-clinical experimental research findings on how these channels/exchangers are regulated in both in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia. The blockade or transgenic knockdown of these proteins was shown to be neuroprotective in these ischemia models. Taken together, these non-NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms may serve as novel therapeutic targets for stroke intervention.","The neuroprotective properties for certain medical gases have been observed for decades, leading to extensive research that has been widely reported and continues to garner interest. Common gases including oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide, volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane, sevoflurane, halothane, enflurane and desflurane, non-volatile anesthetics such as xenon and nitrous oxide, inert gases such as helium and argon, and even gases classically considered to be toxic (e.g., hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide) have all been supported by the evidence alluding to their use as potential neuroprotective agents. A wide range of neural injury types such as ischemic/hemorrhagic, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries, neurodegenerative disease as well as spinal cord ischemia have been used as platforms for studying the neuroprotective effects of these gases, yet until now, none of the gases has been widely introduced into clinical use specifically for protection against neural injury. Insufficient clinical data together with contradictory paradigms and results further hinders the clinical trials. However, pre-clinical models suggest that despite the various classes of gases and the broad range of injuries to which medical gases confer, protection, several underlying mechanisms for their neuroprotective properties are similar. In this review, we summarize the literature concerning the neuroprotective effect of each gas and its underlying mechanisms, extract common targets reported for the neuroprotective effects of different gases, highlight the conflicting observations from clinical trials and further discuss the possible hindrances impeding clinical applications in order to propose future research perspectives and therapeutic exploitations.","Stroke is deemed a worldwide leading cause of neurological disability and death, however, there is currently no promising pharmacotherapy for acute ischemic stroke aside from intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis. Yet because of the narrow therapeutic time window involved, thrombolytic application is very restricted in clinical settings. Accumulating data suggest that non-pharmaceutical therapies for stroke might provide new opportunities for stroke treatment. Here we review recent research progress in the mechanisms and clinical implications of non-pharmaceutical therapies, mainly including neuroprotective approaches such as hypothermia, ischemic/hypoxic conditioning, acupuncture, medical gases and transcranial laser therapy. In addition, we briefly summarize mechanical endovascular recanalization devices and recovery devices for the treatment of the chronic phase of stroke and discuss the relative merits of these devices.","Researchers who have uncovered the presence of stem cells in an adult's central nervous system have not only challenged the dogma that new neurons cannot be generated during adulthood, but also shed light on the etiology and disease mechanisms underlying many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Brain trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders pose enormous burdens at both personal and societal levels. Although medications for these disorders are widely used, the treatment mechanisms underlying the illnesses remain largely elusive. In the past decade, an increasing amount of evidence indicate that adult neurogenesis (i.e. generating new CNS neurons during adulthood) may be involved in the pathology of different CNS disorders, and thus neurogenesis may be a potential target area for treatments. Although new neurons were shown to be a major player in mediating treatment efficacy of neurological and psychotropic drugs on cognitive functions, it is still debatable if the altered production of new neurons can cause the disorders. This review hence seeks to discuss pre and current clinical studies that demonstrate the functional impact adult neurogenesis have on neurological and psychiatric illnesses while examining the related underlying disease mechanisms.","Immune and inflammatory responses actively modulate the pathophysiological processes of acute brain injuries such as stroke. Soon after the onset of stroke, signals such as brain-derived antigens, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and chemokines are released from the injured brain into the systemic circulation. The injured brain also communicates with peripheral organs through the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Many of these diverse signals not only activate resident immune cells in the brain, but also trigger robust immune responses in the periphery. Peripheral immune cells then migrate toward the site of injury and release additional cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules, causing further disruptive or protective effects in the ischemic brain. Bidirectional communication between the injured brain and the peripheral immune system is now known to regulate the progression of stroke pathology as well as tissue repair. In the end, this exquisitely coordinated crosstalk helps determine the fate of animals after stroke. This article reviews the literature on ischemic brain-derived signals through which peripheral immune responses are triggered, and the potential impact of these peripheral responses on brain injury and repair. Pharmacological strategies and cell-based therapies that target the dialog between the brain and peripheral immune system show promise as potential novel treatments for stroke.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.12.003 PMID: 24373958  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Excitotoxicity, the specific type of neurotoxicity mediated by glutamate, may be the missing link between ischemia and neuronal death, and intervening the mechanistic steps that lead to excitotoxicity can prevent stroke damage. Interest in excitotoxicity began fifty years ago when monosodium glutamate was found to be neurotoxic. Evidence soon demonstrated that glutamate is not only the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, but also a critical transmitter for signaling neurons to degenerate following stroke. The finding led to a number of clinical trials that tested inhibitors of excitotoxicity in stroke patients. Glutamate exerts its function in large by activating the calcium-permeable ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR), and different subpopulations of the NMDAR may generate different functional outputs, depending on the signaling proteins directly bound or indirectly coupled to its large cytoplasmic tail. Synaptic activity activates the GluN2A subunit-containing NMDAR, leading to activation of the pro-survival signaling proteins Akt, ERK, and CREB. During a brief episode of ischemia, the extracellular glutamate concentration rises abruptly, and stimulation of the GluN2B-containing NMDAR in the extrasynaptic sites triggers excitotoxic neuronal death via PTEN, cdk5, and DAPK1, which are directly bound to the NMDAR, nNOS, which is indirectly coupled to the NMDAR via PSD95, and calpain, p25, STEP, p38, JNK, and SREBP1, which are further downstream. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature on excitotoxicity and our perspectives on how the new generation of excitotoxicity inhibitors may succeed despite the failure of the previous generation of drugs.","Cell therapy is emerging as a viable therapy to restore neurological function after stroke. Many types of stem/progenitor cells from different sources have been explored for their feasibility and efficacy for the treatment of stroke. Transplanted cells not only have the potential to replace the lost circuitry, but also produce growth and trophic factors, or stimulate the release of such factors from host brain cells, thereby enhancing endogenous brain repair processes. Although stem/progenitor cells have shown a promising role in ischemic stroke in experimental studies as well as initial clinical pilot studies, cellular therapy is still at an early stage in humans. Many critical issues need to be addressed including the therapeutic time window, cell type selection, delivery route, and in vivo monitoring of their migration pattern. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive synopsis of preclinical evidence and clinical experience of various donor cell types, their restorative mechanisms, delivery routes, imaging strategies, future prospects and challenges for translating cell therapies as a neurorestorative regimen in clinical applications.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10-15% of all strokes and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Currently, no effective medical treatment is available to improve functional outcomes in patients with ICH. Potential therapies targeting secondary brain injury are arousing a great deal of interest in translational studies. Increasing evidence has shown that inflammation is the key contributor of ICH-induced secondary brain injury. Inflammation progresses in response to various stimuli produced after ICH. Hematoma components initiate inflammatory signaling via activation of microglia, subsequently releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to attract peripheral inflammatory infiltration. Hemoglobin (Hb), heme, and iron released after red blood cell lysis aggravate ICH-induced inflammatory injury. Danger associated molecular patterns such as high mobility group box 1 protein, released from damaged or dead cells, trigger inflammation in the late stage of ICH. Preclinical studies have identified inflammatory signaling pathways that are involved in microglial activation, leukocyte infiltration, toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, and danger associated molecular pattern regulation in ICH. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ICH-induced inflammatory injury have facilitated the identification of several novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ICH. This review summarizes recent progress concerning the mechanisms underlying ICH-induced inflammation. We focus on the inflammatory signaling pathways involved in microglial activation and TLR signaling, and explore potential therapeutic interventions by targeting the removal of hematoma components and inhibition of TLR signaling.","The brain vasculature has been increasingly recognized as a key player that directs brain development, regulates homeostasis, and contributes to pathological processes. Following ischemic stroke, the reduction of blood flow elicits a cascade of changes and leads to vascular remodeling. However, the temporal profile of vascular changes after stroke is not well understood. Growing evidence suggests that the early phase of cerebral blood volume (CBV) increase is likely due to the improvement in collateral flow, also known as arteriogenesis, whereas the late phase of CBV increase is attributed to the surge of angiogenesis. Arteriogenesis is triggered by shear fluid stress followed by activation of endothelium and inflammatory processes, while angiogenesis induces a number of pro-angiogenic factors and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The status of collaterals in acute stroke has been shown to have several prognostic implications, while the causal relationship between angiogenesis and improved functional recovery has yet to be established in patients. A number of interventions aimed at enhancing cerebral blood flow including increasing collateral recruitment are under clinical investigation. Transplantation of EPCs to improve angiogenesis is also underway. Knowledge in the underlying physiological mechanisms for improved arteriogenesis and angiogenesis shall lead to more effective therapies for ischemic stroke.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and often fatal stroke subtype for which specific therapies and treatments remain elusive. To address this, many recent experimental and translational studies of ICH have been conducted, and these have led to several ongoing clinical trials. This review focuses on the progress of translational studies of ICH including those of the underlying causes and natural history of ICH, animal models of the condition, and effects of ICH on the immune and cardiac systems, among others. Current and potential clinical trials also are discussed for both ICH alone and with intraventricular extension.","Despite decades of study, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) continues to be a serious and significant health problem in the United States and worldwide. The mechanisms contributing to brain injury after SAH remain unclear. Traditionally, most in vivo research has heavily emphasized the basic mechanisms of SAH over the pathophysiological or morphological changes of delayed cerebral vasospasm after SAH. Unfortunately, the results of clinical trials based on this premise have mostly been disappointing, implicating some other pathophysiological factors, independent of vasospasm, as contributors to poor clinical outcomes. Delayed cerebral vasospasm is no longer the only culprit. In this review, we summarize recent data from both experimental and clinical studies of SAH and discuss the vast array of physiological dysfunctions following SAH that ultimately lead to cell death. Based on the progress in neurobiological understanding of SAH, the terms ""early brain injury"" and ""delayed brain injury"" are used according to the temporal progression of SAH-induced brain injury. Additionally, a new concept of the vasculo-neuronal-glia triad model for SAH study is highlighted and presents the challenges and opportunities of this model for future SAH applications.","Obesity is a global epidemic associated with a series of secondary complications and comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, sleep-breathing disorders, and certain forms of cancer. On the surface, it seems that obesity is simply the phenotypic manifestation of deliberately flawed food intake behavior with the consequence of dysbalanced energy uptake and expenditure and can easily be reversed by caloric restriction and exercise. Notwithstanding this assumption, the disappointing outcomes of long-term clinical studies based on this assumption show that the problem is much more complex. Obviously, recent studies render that specific neurocircuits involved in appetite regulation are etiologically integrated in the pathomechanism, suggesting obesity should be regarded as a neurobiological disease rather than the consequence of detrimental food intake habits. Moreover, apart from the physical manifestation of overeating, a growing body of evidence suggests a close relationship with psychological components comprising mood disturbances, altered reward perception and motivation, or addictive behavior. Given that current dietary and pharmacological strategies to overcome the burgeoning threat of the obesity problem are of limited efficacy, bear the risk of adverse side-effects, and in most cases are not curative, new concepts integratively focusing on the fundamental neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying overeating are urgently required. This new approach to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies would justify assigning obesity to the spectrum of neuropsychological diseases. Our objective is to give an overview on the current literature that argues for this view and, on the basis of this knowledge, to deduce an integrative model for the development of obesity originating from disturbed neuropsychological functioning.","Preconditioning is a phenomenon in which brief episodes of a sublethal insult induce robust protection against subsequent lethal injuries. Preconditioning has been observed in multiple organisms and can occur in the brain as well as other tissues. Extensive animal studies suggest that the brain can be preconditioned to resist acute injuries, such as ischemic stroke, neonatal hypoxia/ischemia, surgical brain injury, trauma, and agents that are used in models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Effective preconditioning stimuli are numerous and diverse, ranging from transient ischemia, hypoxia, hyperbaric oxygen, hypothermia and hyperthermia, to exposure to neurotoxins and pharmacological agents. The phenomenon of ""cross-tolerance,"" in which a sublethal stress protects against a different type of injury, suggests that different preconditioning stimuli may confer protection against a wide range of injuries. Research conducted over the past few decades indicates that brain preconditioning is complex, involving multiple effectors such as metabolic inhibition, activation of extra- and intracellular defense mechanisms, a shift in the neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance, and reduction in inflammatory sequelae. An improved understanding of brain preconditioning should help us identify innovative therapeutic strategies that prevent or at least reduce neuronal damage in susceptible patients. In this review, we focus on the experimental evidence of preconditioning in the brain and systematically survey the models used to develop paradigms for neuroprotection, and then discuss the clinical potential of brain preconditioning.","Since the mid 1990s, the intriguing dynamics of the brain at rest has been attracting a growing body of research in neuroscience. Neuroimaging studies have revealed distinct functional networks that slowly activate and deactivate, pointing to the existence of an underlying network dynamics emerging spontaneously during rest, with specific spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed and tested with the use of large-scale computational models of coupled brain areas. However, a mechanistic explanation that encompasses all the phenomena observed in the brain during rest is still to come. In this review, we provide an overview of the key findings of resting-state activity covering a range of neuroimaging modalities including fMRI, EEG and MEG. We describe how to best define and analyze anatomical and functional brain networks and how unbalancing these networks may lead to problems with mental health. Finally, we review existing large-scale models of resting-state dynamics in health and disease. An important common feature of resting-state models is that the emergence of resting-state functional networks is obtained when the model parameters are such that the system operates at the edge of a bifurcation. At this critical working point, the global network dynamics reveals correlation patterns that are spatially shaped by the underlying anatomical structure, leading to an optimal fit with the empirical BOLD functional connectivity. However, new insights coming from recent studies, including faster oscillatory dynamics and non-stationary functional connectivity, must be taken into account in future models to fully understand the network mechanisms leading to the resting-state activity.","Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disorder that affects thousands of individuals each year. Over the past decades an enormous progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular and cellular events generated by SCI, providing insights into crucial mechanisms that contribute to tissue damage and regenerative failure of injured neurons. Current treatment options for SCI include the use of high dose methylprednisolone, surgical interventions to stabilize and decompress the spinal cord, and rehabilitative care. Nonetheless, SCI is still a harmful condition for which there is yet no cure. Cellular, molecular, rehabilitative training and combinatorial therapies have shown promising results in animal models. Nevertheless, work remains to be done to ascertain whether any of these therapies can safely improve patient's condition after human SCI. This review provides an extensive overview of SCI research, as well as its clinical component. It starts covering areas from physiology and anatomy of the spinal cord, neuropathology of the SCI, current clinical options, neuronal plasticity after SCI, animal models and techniques to assess recovery, focusing the subsequent discussion on a variety of promising neuroprotective, cell-based and combinatorial therapeutic approaches that have recently moved, or are close, to clinical testing.","Developmental studies and experimental data have enabled us to assert that the terminal cell differentiation state is reversible, and that altering the balance of specific transcription factors could be a powerful strategy for inducing pluripotency. Due to the risks related to using induced pluripotent cells in clinical applications, biologists are now striving to develop methods to induce a committed differentiated cell type by direct conversion of another cell line. Several reprogramming factors have been discovered, and some cellular phenotypes have been obtained by novel transdifferentiation processes. It has been recently demonstrated that induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) can be obtained from rodent and human somatic cells, like fibroblasts, through the forced expression of defined transcription factors. To date, two different approaches have been successfully used to obtain iNSCs: a direct method and an indirect method that involves an intermediate destabilized state. The possibility to induce characterized iNSCs from human cells, e.g. fibroblasts, has opened new horizons for research in human disease modelling and cellular therapeutic applications in the neurological field. This review focuses on reported reprogramming techniques and innovative techniques that can be further explored in this area, as well as on the criteria for the phenotypic characterization of iNSCs and their use in developing novel therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.","Over the past two decades, the development of neuroimaging techniques has allowed the non-invasive investigation of neuroplastic changes associated with psychotherapeutic treatment. The aim of the present article is to present a systematic and critical review of longitudinal studies addressing the impact of psychotherapy on the brain published to date. After summarizing the results reported in the literature for each psychiatric disorder separately (i.e. obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, unipolar major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, specific phobia, schizophrenia), we discuss the results focusing on three questions of interest: (i) whether neurobiological changes which follow psychotherapy occur in regions that showed significant neurofunctional alteration pre-treatment; (ii) whether these neurobiological changes are similar, or different, to those observed following pharmacological treatment; and (iii) whether neurobiological changes could be used as an objective means of monitoring the progress and outcome of psychotherapy. The evidence reviewed indicates that (i) depending on the disorder under investigation, psychotherapy results in either a normalisation of abnormal patterns of activity, the recruitment of additional areas which did not show altered activation prior to treatment, or a combination of the two; (ii) the effects of psychotherapy on brain function are comparable to those of medication for some but not all disorders; and (iii) there is preliminary evidence that neurobiological changes are associated with the progress and outcome of psychotherapy. It is hoped that a better understanding of the impact of psychotherapy on brain function will eventually inform the development of new biologically informed treatments and allow clinicians to make more effective treatment decisions.","Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone do not only act as transcriptional factors in the regulation of gene expression after intracellular back-oxidation into the 5-α pregnane steroids but may also alter neuronal excitability through interactions with specific neurotransmitter receptors. In particular, certain 3α-reduced metabolites of progesterone such as 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone) and 3α,5β-tetrahydroprogesterone (pregnanolone) are potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABA(A) receptor complex. During the last years, the downregulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis has been intensively discussed to be a possible contributor to the development of anxiety and depressive disorder. Reduced levels of allopregnanolone in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid were found to be associated with major depression, anxiety disorders, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, negative symptoms in schizophrenia, or impulsive aggression. The importance of allopregnanolone for the regulation of emotion and its therapeutical use in depression and anxiety may not only involve GABAergic mechanisms, but probably also includes enhancement of neurogenesis, myelination, neuroprotection, and regulatory effects on HPA axis function. Certain pharmacokinetic obstacles limit the therapeutic use of natural neurosteroids (low bioavailability, oxidation to the ketone). Until now synthetic neuroactive steroids could not be established in the treatment of anxiety disorders or depression. However, the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) which is important for neurosteroidogenesis has been identified as a potential novel target. TSPO ligands such as XBD 173 increase neurosteroidogenesis and have anxiolytic effects with a favorable side effect profile.","Progesterone is commonly considered as a female reproductive hormone and is well-known for its role in pregnancy. It is less well appreciated that progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone are also male hormones, as they are produced in both sexes by the adrenal glands. In addition, they are synthesized within the nervous system. Progesterone and allopregnanolone are associated with adaptation to stress, and increased production of progesterone within the brain may be part of the response of neural cells to injury. Progesterone receptors (PR) are widely distributed throughout the brain, but their study has been mainly limited to the hypothalamus and reproductive functions, and the extra-hypothalamic receptors have been neglected. This lack of information about brain functions of PR is unexpected, as the protective and trophic effects of progesterone are much investigated, and as the therapeutic potential of progesterone as a neuroprotective and promyelinating agent is currently being assessed in clinical trials. The little attention devoted to the brain functions of PR may relate to the widely accepted assumption that non-reproductive actions of progesterone may be mainly mediated by allopregnanolone, which does not bind to PR, but acts as a potent positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A) receptors. The aim of this review is to critically discuss effects of progesterone on the nervous system via PR, and of allopregnanolone via its modulation of GABA(A) receptors, with main focus on the brain.","Allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid derived from progesterone, is synthesized within the nervous tissue, by means of specific enzymes. Contrary to progesterone and its first metabolite dihydroprogesterone, allopregnanolone is able to interact with GABA-A receptor and not with the classical progesterone receptor. This suggests that the effect of progesterone administration may be due to activation of progesterone receptor, or of GABA-A receptor, or both. However, this is rarely considered in the experimental studies. Here we summarize and discuss the hot topics involving the actions of allopregnanolone within the nervous tissue. One major role of this neuroactive steroid is neuroprotection in case of lesion, ischemia or peripheral neuropathies (i.e., diabetes). In addition, allopregnanolone may reduce the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, Parkinson, Niemann-Pick type C, multiple sclerosis) in animal models and now translational studies are developed for its therapeutic use. Allopregnanolone may exert a beneficial effect also in case of neuropathic pain and it is also a potential candidate for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Finally, this neuroactive steroid seems to have important physiological roles in the early differentiation of some neural circuits (in particular at hippocampal level), and to reduce stress during pregnancy. In conclusion, it appears that allopregnanolone is a key regulator of physiological functions and may have interesting therapeutic perspectives for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.","Herein, we review a translational development plan to advance allopregnanolone to the clinic as a regenerative therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's. Allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid that declines with age and neurodegenerative disease, was exogenously administered and assessed for safety and efficacy to promote neuro-regeneration, cognitive function and reduction of Alzheimer's pathology. Allopregnanolone-induced neurogenesis correlated with restoration of learning and memory function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and was comparably efficacious in aged normal mice. Critical to success was a dosing and treatment regimen that was consistent with the temporal requirements of systems biology of regeneration in brain. A treatment regimen that adhered to regenerative requirements of brain was also efficacious in reducing Alzheimer's pathology. With an optimized dosing and treatment regimen, chronic allopregnanolone administration promoted neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, reduced neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid burden while increasing markers of white matter generation and cholesterol homeostasis. Allopregnanolone meets three of the four drug-like physicochemical properties described by Lipinski's rule that predict the success rate of drugs in development for clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes, securing GMP material, development of clinically translatable formulations and acquiring regulatory approval are discussed. Investigation of allopregnanolone as a regenerative therapeutic has provided key insights into mechanistic targets for neurogenesis and disease modification, dosing requirements, optimal treatment regimen, route of administration and the appropriate formulation necessary to advance to proof of concept clinical studies to determine efficacy of allopregnanolone as a regenerative and disease modifying therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.","A successful pregnancy requires multiple adaptations in the mother's brain that serve to optimise foetal growth and development, protect the foetus from adverse prenatal programming and prevent premature delivery of the young. Pregnancy hormones induce, organise and maintain many of these adaptations. Steroid hormones play a critical role and of particular importance is the progesterone metabolite and neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone is produced in increasing amounts during pregnancy both in the periphery and in the maternal and foetal brain. This review critically examines a role for allopregnanolone in both the maternal and foetal brain during pregnancy and development in protecting pregnancy and birth outcomes, with particular emphasis on its role in relation to stress exposure at this time. Late pregnancy is associated with suppressed stress responses. Thus, we begin by considering what is known about the central mechanisms in the maternal brain, induced by allopregnanolone, that protect the foetus(es) from exposure to harmful levels of maternal glucocorticoids as a result of stress during pregnancy. Next we discuss the central mechanisms that prevent premature secretion of oxytocin and consider a role for allopregnanolone in minimising the risk of preterm birth. Allopregnanolone also plays a key role in the foetal brain, where it promotes development and is neuroprotective. Hence we review the evidence about disruption to neurosteroid production in pregnancy, through prenatal stress or other insults, and the immediate and long-term adverse consequences for the offspring. Finally we address whether progesterone or allopregnanolone treatment can rescue some of these deficits in the offspring.","Certain women experience negative mood symptoms during the menstrual cycle and progesterone addition in estrogen treatments. In women with PMDD increased negative mood symptoms related to allopregnanolone increase during the luteal phase of ovulatory menstrual cycles. In anovulatory cycles no symptom or sex steroid increase occurs. This is unexpected as positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor are generally increasing mood. This paradoxical effect has brought forward a hypothesis that the symptoms are provoked by allopregnanolone the GABA-A receptor system. GABA-A is the major inhibitory system in the brain. Positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor include the progesterone metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. GABA-A receptor modulators are known, in low concentrations to induce adverse, anxiogenic effects whereas in higher concentrations show beneficial, calming properties. Positive GABA-A receptor modulators induce strong paradoxical effects e.g. negative mood in 3-8% of those exposed, while up to 25% have moderate symptoms thus similar as the prevalence of PMDD, 3-8% among women in fertile ages, and up to 25% have moderate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The mechanism behind paradoxical reaction might be similar among them who react on positive GABA-A receptor modulators and in women with PMDD. In women the severity of these mood symptoms are related to the allopregnanolone serum concentrations in an inverted U-shaped curve. Negative mood symptoms occur when the serum concentration of allopregnanolone is similar to endogenous luteal phase levels, while low and high concentrations have less effect on mood. Low to moderate progesterone/allopregnanolone concentrations in women increases the activity in the amygdala (measured with fMRI) similar to the changes seen during anxiety reactions. Higher concentrations give decreased amygdala activity similar as seen during benzodiazepine treatment with calming anxiolytic effects. Patients with PMDD show decreased sensitivity in GABA-A receptor sensitivity to diazepam and pregnanolone while increased sensitivity to allopregnanolone. This agrees with findings in animals showing a relation between changes in alpha4 and delta subunits of the GABA-A receptor and anxiogenic effects of allopregnanolone.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that negative mood symptoms in women with PMDD are caused by the paradoxical effect of allopregnanolone mediated via the GABA-A receptor.","Several works have pointed out the importance of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone for the maturation of the central nervous system and for adult behavior. The alteration of neonatal allopregnanolone levels in the first weeks of life alters emotional adult behavior and sensory gating processes. Without ruling out brain structures, some of these behavioral alterations seem to be related to a different functioning of the hippocampus in adult age. We focus here on the different behavioral studies that have revealed the importance of neonatal allopregnanolone levels for the adult response to novel environmental stimuli, anxiety-related behaviors and processing of sensory inputs (prepulse inhibition). An increase in neonatal physiological allopregnanolone levels decreases anxiety and increases novelty responses in adult age, thus affecting the individual response to environmental cues. These effects are also accompanied by a decrease in prepulse inhibition, indicating alterations in sensory gating that have been related to that present in disorders, such as schizophrenia. Moreover, behavioral studies have shown that some of these effects are related to a different functioning of the dorsal hippocampus, as the behavioral effects (decrease in anxiety and locomotion or increase in prepulse inhibition) of intrahippocampal allopregnanolone infusions in adult age are not present in those subjects in whom neonatal allopregnanolone levels were altered. Recent data indicated that this hippocampal involvement may be related to alterations in the expression of gamma-aminobutyric-acid receptors containing α4 and δ subunits, molecular alterations that can persist into adult age and that can, in part, explain the reported behavioral disturbances.","Progesterone is synthesized and actively metabolized in the central and peripheral nervous system, into neuroactive steroid metabolites, such as dihydroprogesterone, allopregnanolone and isopregnanolone. Progesterone and/or its metabolites exert a variety of effects acting as physiological regulators of neuronal and glial development and plasticity, controlling reproduction, neuroendocrine events, mood and affection. In addition, these neuroactive steroids maintain neural homeostasis and exert neuroprotective actions. In agreement, metabolic pathways of progesterone are affected by modifications in the level of gonadal hormones and by pathology or injury with a regional specificity and in a sex-dimorphic way. Therefore, observations here summarized may provide a background to design sex-specific therapies based on progesterone metabolites. On this point of view, considering that one of the major limits of a therapy based on neuroactive steroids could be modifications in their plasma levels and their consequent peripheral effects, pharmacological treatments aimed to increase their levels in the nervous system could provide an interesting therapeutic option.","Because the treatment and management of neuropathic pain are extremely complicated, the characterization of novel analgesics and neuroprotectors with safe toxicological profiles is a crucial need to develop efficient therapies. Several investigations revealed that the natural neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) exerts analgesic, neuroprotective, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. These effects result from AP ability to modulate GABA(A), glycine, L- and T-type calcium channels. It has been shown that AP treatment induced beneficial actions in humans and animal models with no toxic side effects. In particular, a multi-parametric analysis revealed that AP efficiently counteracted chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain in rats. It has also been demonstrated that the modulation of AP-producing enzyme, 3α-hydroxysteroid oxido-reductase (3α-HSOR), in the spinal cord regulates thermal and mechanical pain thresholds of peripheral nerve injured neuropathic rats. The painful symptoms were exacerbated by intrathecal injections of provera (pharmacological inhibitor of 3α-HSOR) which decreased AP production in the spinal cord. By contrast, the enhancement of AP concentration in the intrathecal space induced analgesia and suppression of neuropathic symptoms. Moreover, in vivo siRNA-knockdown of 3α-HSOR expression in healthy rat dorsal root ganglia increased thermal and mechanical pain perceptions while AP evoked a potent antinociceptive action. In humans, blood levels of AP were inversely associated with low back and chest pain. Furthermore, oral administration of AP analogs induced antinociception. Altogether, these data indicate that AP, which possesses a high therapeutic potential and a good toxicological profile, may be used to develop effective and safe strategies against chronic neuropathic pain.","Microglia are the first line of immune defense against central nervous system (CNS) injuries and disorders. These highly plastic cells play dualistic roles in neuronal injury and recovery and are known for their ability to assume diverse phenotypes. A broad range of surface receptors are expressed on microglia and mediate microglial 'On' or 'Off' responses to signals from other host cells as well as invading microorganisms. The integrated actions of these receptors result in tightly regulated biological functions, including cell mobility, phagocytosis, the induction of acquired immunity, and trophic factor/inflammatory mediator release. Over the last few years, significant advances have been made toward deciphering the signaling mechanisms related to these receptors and their specific cellular functions. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge of the surface receptors involved in microglial activation, with an emphasis on their engagement of distinct functional programs and their roles in CNS injuries. It will become evident from this review that microglial homeostasis is carefully maintained by multiple counterbalanced strategies, including, but not limited to, 'On' and 'Off' receptor signaling. Specific regulation of theses microglial receptors may be a promising therapeutic strategy against CNS injuries.","Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is one of the most potent toxins known and a potential biological threat. At the same time, it is among the most widely used therapeutic proteins used yearly by millions of people, especially for cosmetic purposes. Currently, its clinical use in certain types of pain is increasing, and its long-term duration of effects represents a special clinical value. Efficacy of BoNT/A in different types of pain has been found in numerous clinical trials and case reports, as well as in animal pain models. However, sites and mechanisms of BoNT/A actions involved in nociception are a matter of controversy. In analogy with well known neuroparalytic effects in peripheral cholinergic synapses, presently dominant opinion is that BoNT/A exerts pain reduction by inhibiting peripheral neurotransmitter/inflammatory mediator release from sensory nerves. On the other hand, growing number of behavioral and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the requirement of axonal transport for BoNT/A's antinociceptive action. In addition, toxin's enzymatic activity in central sensory regions was clearly identified after its peripheral application. Apart from general pharmacology, this review summarizes the clinical and experimental evidence for BoNT/A antinociceptive activity and compares the data in favor of peripheral vs. central site and mechanism of action. Based on literature review and published results from our laboratory we propose that the hypothesis of peripheral site of BoNT/A action is not sufficient to explain the experimental data collected up to now.","In the last 30 years, the use of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) has progressively increased in many industrial and medical applications. In therapy, NPs may allow more effective cellular and subcellular targeting of drugs. In diagnostic applications, quantum dots are exploited for their optical characteristics, while superparamagnetic iron oxides NPs are used in magnetic resonance imaging. NPs are used in semiconductors, packaging, textiles, solar cells, batteries and plastic materials. Despite the great progress in nanotechnologies, comparatively little is known to date on the effects that exposure to NPs may have on the human body, in general and specifically on the brain. NPs can enter the human body through skin, digestive tract, airways and blood and they may cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the central nervous system. In addition to the paucity of studies describing NP effects on brain function, some of them also suffer of insufficient NPs characterization, inadequate standardization of conditions and lack of contaminant evaluation, so that results from different studies can hardly be compared. It has been shown in vitro and in vivo in rodents that NPs can impair dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. Changes of neuronal morphology and neuronal death were reported in mice treated with NPs. NPs can also affect the respiratory chain of mitochondria and Bax protein levels, thereby causing apoptosis. Changes in expression of genes involved in redox pathways in mouse brain regions were described. NPs can induce autophagy, and accumulate in lysosomes impairing their degradation capacity. Cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking may also be affected. NPs treated animals showed neuroinflammation with microglia activation, which could induce neurodegeneration. Considering the available data, it is important to design adequate models and experimental systems to evaluate in a reliable and controlled fashion the effects of NPs on the brain, and generate data representative of effects on the human brain, thereby useful for developing robust and valid nanosafety standards.","Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent neurological disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of an action tremor that occurs during voluntary motion and affects primarily the upper limbs. The worldwide prevalence of the disease in the general population is 0.9%, increasing to 4.6% in individuals ≥65 years old. Standard pharmaceutical treatments are only moderately effective, reducing tremor amplitudes in ∼50% of patients, a phenomenon partly explained by the fact that the diagnosis of ET is based solely on clinical findings rather than biological markers. Furthermore, the pathophysiological origin of ET remains controversial, leading to heated debates as to whether it should be considered a neurodegenerative disorder or as a dynamic oscillatory disturbances of neurologic origin. Progress has been made in the understanding of its etiology as it is now accepted that genetic components must at least explain the familial cases of ET, and the evidence implicating the olivocerebellar and cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways is strong. However, a strong disconnection between human genetics, pathophysiological, and mouse genetics studies exists in the field of ET, with little use of all the knowledge gathered from the different research disciplines. This review highlights our current knowledge on ET from both a human population and mouse genetics perspective hoping to reconcile evidence from both fields and leading to novel clues guiding future studies. We argue that better communication between researchers of different fields is warranted to define the biological origin of ET in the hope of leading to the development of better treatments.","Autophagy and apoptosis are basic physiologic processes contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Autophagy encompasses pathways that target long-lived cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles. It involves a sequential set of events including double membrane formation, elongation, vesicle maturation and finally delivery of the targeted materials to the lysosome. Apoptotic cell death is best described through its morphology. It is characterized by cell rounding, membrane blebbing, cytoskeletal collapse, cytoplasmic condensation, and fragmentation, nuclear pyknosis, chromatin condensation/fragmentation, and formation of membrane-enveloped apoptotic bodies, that are rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages or neighboring cells. Neurodegenerative disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in the Western societies, with larger percentage of members living to an older age. They have to be seen not only as a health problem, but since they are care-intensive, they also carry a significant economic burden. Deregulation of autophagy plays a pivotal role in the etiology and/or progress of many of these diseases. Herein, we briefly review the latest findings that indicate the involvement of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. We provide a brief introduction to autophagy and apoptosis pathways focusing on the role of mitochondria and lysosomes. We then briefly highlight pathophysiology of common neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Then, we describe functions of autophagy and apoptosis in brain homeostasis, especially in the context of the aforementioned disorders. Finally, we discuss different ways that autophagy and apoptosis modulation may be employed for therapeutic intervention during the maintenance of neurodegenerative disorders.","Chronic restraint stress leads to increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein in some regions of the brain, e.g. the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) but decreases in other regions such as the CA3 region of the hippocampus and dendritic spine density increases or decreases in line with these changes in BDNF. Given the powerful influence that BDNF has on dendritic spine growth, these observations suggest that the fundamental reason for the direction and extent of changes in dendritic spine density in a particular region of the brain under stress is due to the changes in BDNF there. The most likely cause of these changes is provided by the stress initiated release of steroids, which readily enter neurons and alter gene expression, for example that of BDNF. Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids tend to have opposite effects on BDNF gene expression offering the possibility that differences in the distribution of their receptors and of their downstream effects might provide a basis for the differential transcription of the BDNF genes. Alternatively, differences in the extent of methylation and acetylation in the epigenetic control of BDNF transcription are possible in different parts of the brain following stress. Although present evidence points to changes in BDNF transcription being the major causal agent for the changes in spine density in different parts of the brain following stress, steroids have significant effects on downstream pathways from the TrkB receptor once it is acted upon by BDNF, including those that modulate the density of dendritic spines. Finally, although glucocorticoids play a canonical role in determining BDNF modulation of dendritic spines, recent studies have shown a role for corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in this regard. There is considerable improvement in the extent of changes in spine size and density in rodents with forebrain specific knockout of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) even when the glucocorticoid pathways are left intact. It seems then that CRF does have a role to play in determining BDNF control of dendritic spines.","Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system, including the retina. Retinal cells, in particular neurons, astrocytes, and Müller, microglial and endothelial cells express this peptide and its receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4 and/or Y5). Several studies have shown that NPY is expressed in the retina of various mammalian and non-mammalian species. However, studies analyzing the distribution of NPY receptors in the retina are still scarce. Although the physiological roles of NPY in the retina have not been completely elucidated, its early expression strongly suggests that NPY may be involved in the development of retinal circuitry. NPY inhibits the increase in [Ca(2+)]i triggered by elevated KCl in retinal neurons, protects retinal neural cells against toxic insults and induces the proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the retina, specifically proliferation, neuromodulation and neuroprotection. Alterations in the NPY system in the retina might contribute to the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, and NPY and its receptors might be viewed as potentially novel therapeutic targets.","Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels are encoded by HCN1-4 gene family and have four subtypes. These channels are activated upon hyperpolarization of membrane potential and conduct an inward, excitatory current Ih in the nervous system. Ih acts as pacemaker current to initiate rhythmic firing, dampen dendritic excitability and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This review summarizes recent insights into the cellular functions of Ih and associated behavior such as learning and memory, sleep and arousal. HCN channels are excellent targets of various cellular signals to finely regulate neuronal responses to external stimuli. Numerous mechanisms, including transcriptional control, trafficking, as well as channel assembly and modiﬁcation, underlie HCN channel regulation. In the next section, we discuss how the intracellular signals, especially recent findings concerning protein kinases and interacting proteins such as cGKII, Ca(2+)/CaMKII and TRIP8b, regulate function and expression of HCN channels, and subsequently provide an overview of the effects of neurotransmitters on HCN channels and their corresponding intracellular mechanisms. We also discuss the dysregulation of HCN channels in pathological conditions. Finally, insight into future directions in this exciting area of ion channel research is provided.","The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a catalytic machinery that targets numerous cellular proteins for degradation, thus being essential to control a wide range of basic cellular processes and cell survival. Degradation of intracellular proteins via the UPS is a tightly regulated process initiated by tagging a target protein with a specific ubiquitin chain. Neurons are particularly vulnerable to any change in protein composition, and therefore the UPS is a key regulator of neuronal physiology. Alterations in UPS activity may induce pathological responses, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. Brain ischemia triggers a complex series of biochemical and molecular mechanisms, such as an inflammatory response, an exacerbated production of misfolded and oxidized proteins, due to oxidative stress, and the breakdown of cellular integrity mainly mediated by excitotoxic glutamatergic signaling. Brain ischemia also damages protein degradation pathways which, together with the overproduction of damaged proteins and consequent upregulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, contribute to the accumulation of ubiquitin-containing proteinaceous deposits. Despite recent advances, the factors leading to deposition of such aggregates after cerebral ischemic injury remain poorly understood. This review discusses the current knowledge on the role of the UPS in brain function and the molecular mechanisms contributing to UPS dysfunction in brain ischemia with consequent accumulation of ubiquitin-containing proteins. Chemical inhibitors of the proteasome and small molecule inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes, which promote the degradation of proteins by the proteasome, were both shown to provide neuroprotection in brain ischemia, and this apparent contradiction is also discussed in this review.","The extensive neuroprotective effects of estrogen against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proven in numerous laboratory studies. However, in clinical studies, the exact role of estrogen in AD is still ambiguous. Some evidences even suggested the high levels of estrogen or estrogen replacement treatment increased the risk of AD. Thus, there must be other factors affecting the neuroprotective effects of estrogen. Multiple enzymes and receptor proteins are involved in the biosynthesis, metabolism and signaling pathways of estrogen, and mediate the beneficial effects of estrogen on AD. Previous studies have suggested some polymorphisms of genes encoding these enzymes and proteins are associated with the risk of AD. In addition to the genes associated with estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism and the genes encoding estrogen receptor proteins, some other genes also modulate the effects of estrogen on AD, or interact with other estrogen-associated genes on the progress of AD. The gene-hormone and gene-gene interactions may be key to unraveling the conflicting results regarding the effect of estrogen on AD. In this paper, we will review and discuss the associations between polymorphisms of these genes and their interactions and the susceptibility to AD. A better understanding of these estrogen-associated genes is significant to explore the pathogenesis of AD.","The reuniens and rhomboid nuclei, located in the ventral midline of the thalamus, have long been regarded as having non-specific effects on the cortex, while other evidence suggests that they influence behavior related to the photoperiod, hunger, stress or anxiety. We summarise the recent anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral evidence that these nuclei also influence cognitive processes. The first part of this review describes the reciprocal connections of the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei with the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The connectivity pattern among these structures is consistent with the idea that these ventral midline nuclei represent a nodal hub to influence prefrontal-hippocampal interactions. The second part describes the effects of a stimulation or blockade of the ventral midline thalamus on cortical and hippocampal electrophysiological activity. The final part summarizes recent literature supporting the emerging view that the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei may contribute to learning, memory consolidation and behavioral flexibility, in addition to general behavior and aspects of metabolism.","The prevalence of hearing problems in the Western world has, due to aging of the population, doubled over the past 30 years. Thereby, noise-induced hearing loss is an important factor that worsens over time in addition to age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss is usually measured as an elevation of a person's hearing thresholds, expressed in decibel (dB). However, recent animal studies have unraveled a type of permanent cochlear damage, without an elevation of hearing thresholds. This subtle damage is linked to a permanent and progressive degeneration of auditory fibers that occurs in association with damage of the inner hair cell synapse. Afferent neuronal degeneration has been suggested to be involved in hyperacusis (over sensitivity to sound) and tinnitus (a phantom sound percept). Hyperacusis and tinnitus are potentially devastating conditions that are still incurable. The main risk factors to develop tinnitus or hyperacusis are hearing loss, social stress and age. Both tinnitus and hyperacusis have been discussed in the context of a pathological increased response gain in subcortical brain regions as a reaction to deprivation of sensory input. Novel studies confirm the involvement of peripheral deafferentation for tinnitus and hyperacusis, but suggest that the disorder results from different brain responses to different degrees of deafferentation: while tinnitus may arise as a failure of the brain to adapt to deprived peripheral input, hyperacusis may result from an 'over-adaptive' increase in response gain. Moreover, moderate and high stress levels at the time of acoustic trauma have been suggested to play a pivotal role in the vulnerability of the cochlea to acoustic damage and therefore for the development of tinnitus and hyperacusis.","The research field of adult neurogenesis is rapidly expanding with more and more information becoming available on the identity of the cells located within the subventricular zone (SVZ). Much of our understanding is based on rodent studies. The SVZ is comprised of several different cell types including B1 astrocytes, transit amplifying progenitor cells (C cells), and neuroblasts (A cells). B1 astrocytes are the quiescent neural stem cells that continue to divide throughout a lifespan. They give rise to a progenitor cell, termed a C cell, which in turn, generates neuroblasts destined for the olfactory bulb. There is much controversy over how to distinguish various SVZ cell types. This review summarizes the known markers for rodent SVZ cell types, with particular attention paid towards B1 astrocytes and C cells. Unfortunately, there is no perfect stem cell marker. B1 astrocytes, C cells, and neuroblasts gain and lose marker expression patterns throughout their lineage progression. These expression patterns often overlap at the transition from one cell type to another. The SVZ cell lineage must be seen as a continuum, rather than a static and inert system. This view will aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying marker expression and cellular behavior in the SVZ.","The past decade has witnessed an explosion of evidence suggesting that many neurodegenerative diseases can be detected years, if not decades, earlier than previously thought. To date, these scientific advances have not provoked any parallel translational or clinical improvements. There is an urgency to capitalize on this momentum so earlier detection of disease can be more readily translated into improved health-related quality of life for families at risk for, or suffering with, neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measurement in neurodegenerative diseases and the importance of these ""patient reported outcomes"" for all clinical research. Next, we address HRQOL following early identification or predictive genetic testing in some neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion diseases, hereditary ataxias, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and Wilson's disease. After a brief report of available direct-to-consumer genetic tests, we address the juxtaposition of earlier disease identification with assumed reluctance toward predictive genetic testing. Forty-one studies examining health-related outcomes following predictive genetic testing for neurodegenerative disease suggested that (a) extreme or catastrophic outcomes are rare; (b) consequences commonly include transiently increased anxiety and/or depression; (c) most participants report no regret; (d) many persons report extensive benefits to receiving genetic information; and (e) stigmatization and discrimination for genetic diseases are poorly understood and policy and laws are needed. Caution is appropriate for earlier identification of neurodegenerative diseases but findings suggest further progress is safe, feasible and likely to advance clinical care.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.09.001 PMID: 24035806  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"This paper is intended to discuss some of the scientific and ethical issues that are created by increased research efforts towards earlier diagnosis, as well as to treatment of, human prion diseases (and related dementias), including the resulting consequences for individuals, their families, and society. Most patients with prion disease currently are diagnosed when they are about 2/3 of the way through their disease course (Geschwind et al., 2010a; Paterson et al., 2012b), when the disease has progressed so far that even treatments that stop the disease process would probably have little benefit. Although there are currently no treatments available for prion diseases, we and others have realized that we must diagnose patients earlier and with greater accuracy so that future treatments have hope of success. As approximately 15% of prion diseases have a autosomal dominant genetic etiology, this further adds to the complexity of ethical issues, particularly regarding when to conduct genetic testing, release of genetic results, and when or if to implement experimental therapies. Human prion diseases are both infectious and transmissible; great care is required to balance the needs of the family and individual with both public health needs and strained hospital budgets. It is essential to proactively examine and address the ethical issues involved, as well as to define and in turn provide best standards of care.","This article examines some of the ethical concerns relevant for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We emphasize the importance for providing a competent assessment of the clinical deficit to correctly identify the disease and to avoid incorrect diagnoses. Conveying the diagnosis to the patient and their family requires empathy and it is important to remain supportive and positive, even in the face of this incurable disease. The essence of care in ALS is to permit the patient to have optimal function for their level of ability. This may require the use of gastrostomy and non-invasive or permanent ventilation. Employment of a multi-disciplinary team will permit optimization of patient care to achieve a good quality of life for as long as possible. The patient should also be informed of the risks associated with unproven therapies and the risks and potential benefits of therapeutic trials. The wishes of patients in regard to gastrostomy, long-term ventilation and end-of life decisions must be considered in an unbiased fashion. Recent advances in the genetics of familial ALS (FALS) have demonstrated some overlap between FALS, sporadic ALS and fronto-temporal lobar dementia (FTLD). The interpretation and dissemination of the results of genetic testing although important can induce confusion, considerable anxiety and guilt in patients and their families and proper counseling is imperative.","In the absence of disease modifying therapies for dementia, the question rises what the benefits are of an early dementia diagnosis for patients and their caregivers. This paper reviews the caregiver perspective in dementia and addresses the question what the consequences are of promoting earlier dementia diagnosis. An early diagnosis offers caregivers the opportunity to advance the process of adaptation to the caregiver role. Caregivers that are better able to adapt to the changes that characterize dementia, feel more competent to care and experience less psychological problems. However, drawbacks of an early diagnosis may outweigh the benefits if people are left with a diagnosis but little support. There is convincing evidence that multicomponent caregiver interventions in the mild to moderate dementia stages are effective to improve caregiver well-being and delay institutionalization. However, there still exist a gap between the improved possibilities to diagnose people in the predementia stage versus the scarce knowledge on intervention effects in this very early stage. This stresses the urgent need for more research on early caregiver interventions that enhance role adaptation and that include long-term follow-up and cost-effectiveness evaluation. Early interventions may help caregivers in anticipating and accepting the future care role and transitions, with the increased possibility that caregivers can still involve the patient in the decision making process. As levels of stress and burden are still low in the predementia stage it provides excellent opportunities to empower the resources of caregivers.","Should patients with Parkinson's disease participate in research involving stem cell treatments? Are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) the ethical solution to the moral issues regarding embryonic stem cells? How can we adapt trial designs to best assess small numbers of patients in receipt of invasive experimental therapies? Over the last 20 years there has been a revolution in our ability to make stem cells from different sources and use them for therapeutic gain in disorders of the brain. These cells, which are defined by their capacity to proliferate indefinitely as well as differentiate into selective phenotypic cell types, are viewed as being especially attractive for studying disease processes and for grafting in patients with chronic incurable neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review we briefly discuss and summarise where our understanding of stem cell biology has taken us relative to the clinic and patients, before dealing with some of the major ethical issues that work of this nature generates. This includes issues to do with the source of the cells, their ownership and exploitation along with questions about patient recruitment, consent and trial design when they translate to the clinic for therapeutic use.","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a successful therapeutic approach in several patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Hitherto its application was mainly restricted to advanced disease patients resistant to medication or with severe treatment side effects. However, there is now growing interest in earlier application of DBS, aimed at improving clinical outcomes, quality of life, and avoiding psychosocial consequences of chronic disease-related impairments. We address the clinical and ethical aspects of two ""early"" uses of DBS, (1) DBS early in the course of the disease, and (2) DBS early in life (i.e. in children). Possible benefits, risks and burdens are discussed and thoroughly considered. Further research is needed to obtain a careful balance between exposing vulnerable patients to potential severe surgical risks and excluding them from a potentially good outcome.","As the genetics of neurodegenerative disease become better understood, opportunities for genetic susceptibility testing for at-risk individuals will increase. Such testing raises important ethical and practice issues related to test access, informed consent, risk estimation and communication, return of results, and policies to prevent genetic discrimination. The advent of direct-to-consumer genetic susceptibility testing for various neurodegenerative disorders (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and certain prion diseases) means that ethical and practical challenges must be faced not only in traditional research and clinical settings, but also in broader society. This review addresses several topics relevant to the development and implementation of genetic susceptibility tests across research, clinical, and consumer settings; these include appropriate indications for testing, the implications of different methods for disclosing test results, clinical versus personal utility of risk information, psychological and behavioral responses to test results, testing of minors, genetic discrimination, and ethical dilemmas posed by whole-genome sequencing. We also identify future areas of likely growth in the field, including pharmacogenomics and genetic screening for individuals considering or engaged in activities that pose elevated risk of brain injury (e.g., football players, military personnel). APOE gene testing for risk of Alzheimer's disease is used throughout as an instructive case example, drawing upon the authors' experience as investigators in a series of multisite randomized clinical trials that have examined the impact of disclosing APOE genotype status to interested individuals (e.g., first-degree relatives of AD patients, persons with mild cognitive impairment).","There is great interest in the ethical issues associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias given the prevalence of AD and the evolving neuroscience landscape in matters of diagnoses and therapeutics. Much of the ethics discussion arises in the tension between the principle of not doing harm (principle of non-maleficence) in this vulnerable population and the development of effective treatments (principle of beneficence). Autonomy and capacity issues are also numerous, wide-ranging, and concern (1) day to day affairs such as driving safely and spending money wisely, (2) life-time events such as designating a legal representative in case of incapacity, making a will, (3) consenting to treatment and diagnostic procedures, (4) participating in research. The latter issue is particularly thorny and illustrates well the complexity of tackling concerns related to capacity. The impetus to protect AD patients has partly led to ethics regulation and policies making research on inapt patients more difficult because of stringent requirements for signed informed consent or for showing the value of the research to this specific patient population. New issues are arising that relate to earlier diagnosis using biomarkers and (possibly soon) the use of drugs that modify disease progression. We here summarize and discuss the different ethical issues associated with AD from a historical perspective, with emphasis on diagnostic and treatments issues.","As our understanding of the neurobiology of Alzheimer Disease deepens, it has become evident that early intervention is critical to achieving successful therapeutic impact. The availability of diagnostic criteria for preclinical Alzheimer Disease adds momentum to research directed at this goal and even to prevention. The landscape of therapeutic research is thus poised to undergo a dramatic shift in the next 5-10 years, with clinical trials involving subjects at risk for Alzheimer Disease who have few or no symptoms. These trials will also likely rely heavily on genetics, biomarkers, and or risk factor stratification to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer Disease. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to guide this next generation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological clinical pursuit, and discuss some of the foreseeable ethical considerations that may accompany them.","The glial cells of the cerebellum, and particularly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, are characterized by a remarkable phenotypic variety, in which highly peculiar morphological features are associated with specific functional features, unique among the glial cells of the entire CNS. Here, we provide a critical report about the present knowledge of the development of cerebellar glia, including lineage relationships between cerebellar neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the origins and the genesis of the repertoire of glial types, and the processes underlying their acquisition of mature morphological and functional traits. In parallel, we describe and discuss some fundamental roles played by specific categories of glial cells during cerebellar development. In particular, we propose that Bergmann glia exerts a crucial scaffolding activity that, together with the organizing function of Purkinje cells, is necessary to achieve the normal pattern of foliation and layering of the cerebellar cortex. Moreover, we discuss some of the functional tasks of cerebellar astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that are distinctive of cerebellar glia throughout the CNS. Notably, we report about the regulation of synaptic signalling in the molecular and granular layer mediated by Bergmann glia and parenchymal astrocytes, and the functional interaction between oligodendrocyte precursor cells and neurons. On the whole, this review provides an extensive overview of the available literature and some novel insights about the origin and differentiation of the variety of cerebellar glial cells and their function in the developing and mature cerebellum.","The transcription factors, Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8, are the pivotal intracellular effectors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of proteins. BMPs and their receptors are expressed in the nervous system (NS) throughout its development. This review focuses on the actions of Smad 1/5/8 in the developing NS. The mechanisms by which these Smad proteins regulate the induction of the neuroectoderm, the central nervous system (CNS) primordium, and finally the neural crest, which gives rise to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), are reviewed herein. We describe how, following neural tube closure, the most dorsal aspect of the tube becomes a signalling centre for BMPs, which directs the pattern of the development of the dorsal spinal cord (SC), through the action of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8. The direct effects of Smad 1/5/8 signalling on the development of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from various neural progenitor cell populations are then described. Finally, this review discusses the neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with the knockdown of Smad 1/5/8.","Suicidality is exceedingly prevalent in pain patients. Although the pathophysiology of this link remains unclear, it may be potentially related to the partial congruence of physical and emotional pain systems. The latter system's role in suicide is also conspicuous during setbacks and losses sustained in the context of social attachments. Here we propose a model based on the neural pathways mediating reward and anti-reward (i.e., allostatic adjustment to recurrent activation of the reward circuitry); both are relevant etiologic factors in pain, suicide and social attachments. A comprehensive literature search on neurobiology of pain and suicidality was performed. The collected articles were critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized within four key areas: (1) physical and emotional pain, (2) emotional pain and social attachments, (3) pain- and suicide-related alterations of the reward and anti-reward circuits as compared to addiction, which is the premier probe for dysfunction of these circuits and (4) mechanistically informed treatments of co-occurring pain and suicidality. Pain-, stress- and analgesic drugs-induced opponent and proponent states of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways may render reward and anti-reward systems vulnerable to sensitization, cross-sensitization and aberrant learning of contents and contexts associated with suicidal acts and behaviors. These findings suggest that pain patients exhibit alterations in the brain circuits mediating reward (depressed function) and anti-reward (sensitized function) that may affect their proclivity for suicide and support pain and suicidality classification among other ""reward deficiency syndromes"" and a new proposal for ""enhanced anti-reward syndromes"". We suggest that interventions aimed at restoring the balance between the reward and anti-reward networks in patients with chronic pain may help decreasing their suicide risk.","In many circumstances alternative courses of action and thoughts have to be inhibited to allow the emergence of goal-directed behavior. However, this has not been the accepted view in the past and only recently has inhibition earned its own place in the neurosciences as a fundamental cognitive function. In this review we first introduce the concept of inhibition from early psychological speculations based on philosophical theories of the human mind. The broad construct of inhibition is then reduced to its most readily observable component which necessarily is its behavioral manifestation. The study of 'response inhibition' has the advantage of dealing with a relatively simple and straightforward process, the overriding of a planned or already initiated action. Deficient inhibitory processes profoundly affect everyday life, causing impulsive conduct which is generally detrimental for the individual. Impulsivity has been consistently linked to several types of addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania and other psychiatric conditions. Our discussion of the behavioral assessment of impulsivity will focus on objective laboratory tasks of response inhibition that have been implemented in parallel for humans and other species with relatively few qualitative differences. The translational potential of these measures has greatly improved our knowledge of the neurobiological basis of behavioral inhibition and impulsivity. We will then review the current models of behavioral inhibition along with their expression via underlying brain regions, including those involved in the activation of the brain's emergency 'brake' operation, those engaged in more controlled and sustained inhibitory processes and other ancillary executive functions.","Of the numerous neuropeptides identified in the central nervous system, only a few are involved in the control of sexual behaviour. Among these, the most studied are oxytocin, adrenocorticotropin, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone and opioid peptides. While opioid peptides inhibit sexual performance, the others facilitate sexual behaviour in most of the species studied so far (rats, mice, monkeys and humans). However, evidence for a sexual role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, galanin and galanin-like peptide, cholecystokinin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, vasopressin, angiotensin II, hypocretins/orexins and VGF-derived peptides are also available. Corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, vasopressin and angiotensin II inhibit, while substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, hypocretins/orexins and some VGF-derived peptide facilitate sexual behaviour. Neuropeptides influence sexual behaviour by acting mainly in the hypothalamic nuclei (i.e., lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus), in the medial preoptic area and in the spinal cord. However, it is often unclear whether neuropeptides influence the anticipatory phase (sexual arousal and/or motivation) or the consummatory phase (performance) of sexual behaviour, except in a few cases (e.g., opioid peptides and oxytocin). Unfortunately, scarce information has been added in the last 15 years on the neural mechanisms by which neuropeptides influence sexual behaviour, most studied neuropeptides apart. This may be due to a decreased interest of researchers on neuropeptides and sexual behaviour or on sexual behaviour in general. Such a decrease may be related to the discovery of orally effective, locally acting type V phosphodiesterase inhibitors for the therapy of erectile dysfunction.","Situated between the circulation and the brain, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from circulating toxins while securing a specialized environment for neuro-glial signaling. BBB capillary endothelial cells exhibit low transcytotic activity and a tight, junctional network that, aided by the cytoskeleton, restricts paracellular permeability. The latter is subject of extensive research as it relates to neuropathology, edema and inflammation. A key determinant in regulating paracellular permeability is the endothelial cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) that affects junctional and cytoskeletal proteins. Ca(2+) signals are not one-time events restricted to a single cell but often appear as oscillatory [Ca(2+)]i changes that may propagate between cells as intercellular Ca(2+) waves. The effect of Ca(2+) oscillations/waves on BBB function is largely unknown and we here review current evidence on how [Ca(2+)]i dynamics influence BBB permeability.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related devastating neurodegenerative disorder, which severely impacts on the global economic development and healthcare system. Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.","There is currently no approved neuroprotective pharmacotherapy for acute conditions such as stroke and cerebral asphyxia. One of the reasons for this may be the multiplicity of cell death mechanisms, because inhibition of a particular mechanism leaves the brain vulnerable to alternative ones. It is therefore essential to understand the different cell death mechanisms and their interactions. We here review the multiple signaling pathways underlying each of the three main morphological types of cell death--apoptosis, autophagic cell death and necrosis--emphasizing their importance in the neuronal death that occurs during cerebral ischemia and hypoxia-ischemia, and we analyze the interactions between the different mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multiplicity of cell death mechanisms for the design of neuroprotective strategies.","It has been 50 years since Gross and Lapiere discovered collagenolytic activity during tadpole tail metamorphosis, which was later on revealed as MMP-1, the founding member of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Currently, MMPs constitute a large group of endoproteases that are not only able to cleave all protein components of the extracellular matrix, but also to activate or inactivate many other signaling molecules, such as receptors, adhesion molecules and growth factors. Elevated MMP levels are associated with an increasing number of injuries and disorders, such as cancer, inflammation and auto-immune diseases. Yet, MMP upregulation has also been implicated in many physiological functions such as embryonic development, wound healing and angiogenesis and therefore, these proteinases are considered to be crucial mediators in many biological processes. Over the past decennia, MMP research has gained considerable attention in several pathologies, most prominently in the field of cancer metastasis, and more recent investigations also focus on the nervous system, with a striking emphasis on the gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Unfortunately, the contribution of these gelatinases to neuropathological disorders, like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, has overshadowed their potential as modulators of fundamental nervous system functions. Within this review, we wish to highlight the currently known or suggested actions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the developing and adult nervous system and their potential to improve repair or regeneration after nervous system injury.","The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome system are two major protein quality control mechanisms in eukaryotic cells. While the UPS has been considered for decades as the critical regulator in the degradation of various aggregate-prone proteins, autophagy has more recently been shown to be an important pathway implicated in neuronal health and disease. The two hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extracellular β-amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles. It has been suggested that tau accumulation is pathologically more relevant to the development of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD patients than β-amyloid plaques. Here, we review the UPS and autophagy-mediated tau clearance mechanisms and outline the biochemical connections between these two processes. In addition, we discuss pharmacological methods that target these degradation systems for the treatment and prevention of AD.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by slowly progressive neuronal death, but its molecular cascade remains elusive for over 100 years. Since accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (also called granulo-vacuolar degenerations) represents one of the pathologic hallmarks of degenerating neurons in AD, a causative connection between autophagy failure and neuronal death should be present. The aim of this perspective review is at considering such underlying mechanism of AD that age-dependent oxidative stresses may affect the autophagic-lysosomal system via carbonylation and cleavage of heat-shock protein 70.1 (Hsp70.1). AD brains exhibit gradual but continual ischemic insults that cause perturbed Ca(2+) homeostasis, calpain activation, amyloid β deposition, and oxidative stresses. Membrane lipids such as linoleic and arachidonic acids are vulnerable to the cumulative oxidative stresses, generating a toxic peroxidation product 'hydroxynonenal' that can carbonylate Hsp70.1. Recent data advocate for dual roles of Hsp70.1 as a molecular chaperone for damaged proteins and a guardian of lysosomal integrity. Accordingly, impairments of lysosomal autophagy and stabilization may be driven by the calpain-mediated cleavage of carbonylated Hsp70.1, and this causes lysosomal permeabilization and/or rupture with the resultant release of the cell degradation enzyme, cathepsins (calpain-cathepsin hypothesis). Here, the author discusses three topics; (1) how age-related decrease in lysosomal and autophagic activities has a causal connection to programmed neuronal necrosis in sporadic AD, (2) how genetic factors such as apolipoprotein E and presenilin 1 can facilitate lysosomal destabilization in the sequential molecular events, and (3) whether a single cascade can simultaneously account for implications of all players previously reported. In conclusion, Alzheimer neuronal death conceivably occurs by the similar 'calpain-hydroxynonenal-Hsp70.1-cathepsin cascade' with ischemic neuronal death. Blockade of calpain and/or extra-lysosomal cathepsins as well as scavenging of hydroxynonenal would become effective AD therapeutic approaches.","Evaluating external and internal stimuli is critical to survival. Potentially tissue-damaging conditions generate sensory experiences that the organism must respond to in an appropriate, adaptive manner (e.g., withdrawal from the noxious stimulus, if possible, or seeking relief from pain and discomfort). The importance we assign to a signal generated by a noxious state, its salience, reflects our belief as to how likely the underlying situation is to impact our chance of survival. Importantly, it has been hypothesized that aberrant functioning of the brain circuits which assign salience values to stimuli may contribute to chronic pain. We describe examples of this phenomenon, including 'feeling pain' in the absence of a painful stimulus, reporting minimal pain in the setting of major trauma, having an 'analgesic' response in the absence of an active treatment, or reporting no pain relief after administration of a potent analgesic medication, which may provide critical insights into the role that salience circuits play in contributing to numerous conditions characterized by persistent pain. Collectively, a refined understanding of abnormal activity or connectivity of elements within the salience network may allow us to more effectively target interventions to relevant components of this network in patients with chronic pain.","Chemokines - chemotactic cytokines - are small secreted proteins that attract and activate immune and non-immune cells in vitro and in vivo. It has been suggested that chemokines and their receptors play a role in the central nervous system (CNS), in addition to their well established role in the immune system. We focus here on three chemokines-CXCL12 (C-X-C motif ligand 12), CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2), and CX3CL1 (C-X-3C motif ligand 1) - and their principal receptors - CXCR4 (C-X-C motif receptor 4), CCR2 (C-C motif receptor 2) and CX3CR1 (C-X-3C motif receptor 1), respectively. We first introduce the classification of chemokines and their G-protein coupled receptors and the main signaling pathways triggered by receptor activation. We then discuss the cellular distribution of CXCL12/CXCR4, CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in adult brain and the neurotransmission and neuromodulation effects controlled by these chemokines in the adult CNS. Changes in the expression of CXCL12, CCL2 and CX3CL1 and their respective receptors are also increasingly being implicated in the pathogenesis of CNS disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-associated encephalopathy, stroke and multiple sclerosis, and are therefore plausible targets for future pharmacological intervention. The final section thus discusses the role of these chemokines in these pathophysiological states. In conclusion, the role of these chemokines in cellular communication may make it possible: (i) to identify new pathways of neuron-neuron, glia-glia or neuron-glia communications relevant to both normal brain function and neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases; (ii) to develop new therapeutic approaches for currently untreatable brain diseases.","The spinocerebellar ataxias type 1 (SCA1), 2 (SCA2), 3 (SCA3), 6 (SCA6) and 7 (SCA7) are genetically defined autosomal dominantly inherited progressive cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs). They belong to the group of CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases and share pathologically expanded and meiotically unstable glutamine-encoding CAG-repeats at distinct gene loci encoding elongated polyglutamine stretches in the disease proteins. In recent years, progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these currently incurable diseases: Identification of underlying genetic mechanisms made it possible to classify the different ADCAs and to define their clinical and pathological features. Furthermore, advances in molecular biology yielded new insights into the physiological and pathophysiological role of the gene products of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 (i.e. ataxin-1, ataxin-2, ataxin-3, α-1A subunit of the P/Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel, ataxin-7). In the present review we summarize our current knowledge about the polyglutamine ataxias SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 and compare their clinical and electrophysiological features, genetic and molecular biological background, as well as their brain pathologies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the structure, interactions and functions of the different disease proteins. On the basis of these comprehensive data, similarities, differences and possible disease mechanisms are discussed.","Nearly every surgery can elicit a rather therapy-resistant chronic postoperative pain. Preventive medicine is therefore anticipated with hopeful eyes, but requires a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain. Spinal mechanisms of pain amplification are regarded as fundamental to pain chronification, but these mechanisms on their own are not at all likely to be sufficient. Indeed, not every surgical patient develops chronic postoperative pain. Progress in our neurobiological understanding of postoperative pain includes scientific discoveries of 'vulnerability factors', which substantially impact on the spinal cord, augmenting pain amplification mechanisms, perhaps to levels of no-return. In this review we elaborate on spinal pain amplification mechanisms in relation to pain chronification and the impact of vulnerability factors hereon. Moreover, these insights are incorporated within a clinical frame of treatment approaches currently used in surgical settings. As such, this review provides an integrated overview of mechanism-based treatment approaches in prevention of chronic postoperative pain.", ,"Working memory is a crucial component of most cognitive tasks. Its neuronal mechanisms are still unclear despite intensive experimental and theoretical explorations. Most theoretical models of working memory assume both time-invariant neural representations and precise connectivity schemes based on the tuning properties of network neurons. A different, more recent class of models assumes randomly connected neurons that have no tuning to any particular task, and bases task performance purely on adjustment of network readout. Intermediate between these schemes are networks that start out random but are trained by a learning scheme. Experimental studies of a delayed vibrotactile discrimination task indicate that some of the neurons in prefrontal cortex are persistently tuned to the frequency of a remembered stimulus, but the majority exhibit more complex relationships to the stimulus that vary considerably across time. We compare three models, ranging from a highly organized line attractor model to a randomly connected network with chaotic activity, with data recorded during this task. The random network does a surprisingly good job of both performing the task and matching certain aspects of the data. The intermediate model, in which an initially random network is partially trained to perform the working memory task by tuning its recurrent and readout connections, provides a better description, although none of the models matches all features of the data. Our results suggest that prefrontal networks may begin in a random state relative to the task and initially rely on modified readout for task performance. With further training, however, more tuned neurons with less time-varying responses should emerge as the networks become more structured.","Neocortex, the neuronal structure at the base of the remarkable cognitive skills of mammals, is a layered sheet of neuronal tissue composed of juxtaposed and interconnected columns. A cortical column is considered the basic module of cortical processing present in all cortical areas. It is believed to contain a characteristic microcircuit composed of a few thousand neurons. The high degree of cortical segmentation into vertical columns and horizontal layers is a boon for scientific investigation because it eases the systematic dissection and functional analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic connections of the column. In this review we will argue that in order to understand neocortical function one needs to combine a microscopic view, elucidating the workings of the local columnar microcircuits, with a macroscopic view, which keeps track of the linkage of distant cortical modules in different behavioral contexts. We will exemplify this strategy using the model system of vibrissal touch in mice and rats. On the macroscopic level vibrissal touch is an important sense for the subterranean rodents and has been honed by evolution to serve an array of distinct behaviors. Importantly, the vibrissae are moved actively to touch - requiring intricate sensorimotor interactions. Vibrissal touch, therefore, offers ample opportunities to relate different behavioral contexts to specific interactions of distant columns. On the microscopic level, the cortical modules in primary somatosensory cortex process touch inputs at highest magnification and discreteness - each whisker is represented by its own so-called barrel column. The cellular composition, intrinsic connectivity and functional aspects of the barrel column have been studied in great detail. Building on the versatility of genetic tools available in rodents, new, highly selective and flexible cellular and molecular tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity have been devised. Researchers have started to combine these with advanced and highly precise behavioral methods, on par with the precision known from monkey preparations. Therefore, the vibrissal touch model system is exquisitely positioned to combine the microscopic with the macroscopic view and promises to be instrumental in our understanding of neocortical function.","Pioneering human and animal research has yielded a better understanding of the brain networks involved in somatosensory perception and decision making. New methodical achievements in combination with computational formalization allow research questions to be addressed which increasingly reflect not only the complex sensory demands of real environments, but also the cognitive ones. Here, we review the latest research on somatosensory perception and decision making with a special focus on the recruitment of supplementary brain networks which are dependent on the situation-associated sensory and cognitive demands. We also refer to literature on sensory-motor integration processes during visual decision making to delineate the complexity and dynamics of how sensory information is relayed to the motor output system. Finally, we review the latest literature which provides novel evidence that other everyday life situations, such as semantic decision making or social interactions, appear to depend on tactile experiences; suggesting that the sense of touch, being the first sense to develop ontogenetically, may essentially support later development of other conceptual knowledge.","Cortical activity involves large populations of neurons, even when it is limited to functionally coherent areas. Electrophysiological recordings, on the other hand, involve comparatively small neural ensembles, even when modern-day techniques are used. Here we review results which have started to fill the gap between these two scales of inquiry, by shedding light on the statistical distributions of activity in large populations of cells. We put our main focus on data recorded in awake animals that perform simple decision-making tasks and consider statistical distributions of activity throughout cortex, across sensory, associative, and motor areas. We transversally review the complexity of these distributions, from distributions of firing rates and metrics of spike-train structure, through distributions of tuning to stimuli or actions and of choice signals, and finally the dynamical evolution of neural population activity and the distributions of (pairwise) neural interactions. This approach reveals shared patterns of statistical organization across cortex, including: (i) long-tailed distributions of activity, where quasi-silence seems to be the rule for a majority of neurons; that are barely distinguishable between spontaneous and active states; (ii) distributions of tuning parameters for sensory (and motor) variables, which show an extensive extrapolation and fragmentation of their representations in the periphery; and (iii) population-wide dynamics that reveal rotations of internal representations over time, whose traces can be found both in stimulus-driven and internally generated activity. We discuss how these insights are leading us away from the notion of discrete classes of cells, and are acting as powerful constraints on theories and models of cortical organization and population coding.","One of the great challenges of systems neuroscience is to understand how the neocortex transforms neuronal representations of the physical characteristics of sensory stimuli into the percepts which can guide the animal's decisions. Here we present progress made in understanding behavioral and neurophysiological aspects of a highly efficient sensory apparatus, the rat whisker system. Beginning with the 1970s discovery of ""barrels"" in the rat and mouse brain, one line of research has focused on unraveling the circuits that transmit information from the whiskers to the sensory cortex, together with the cellular mechanisms that underlie sensory responses. A second, more recent line of research has focused on tactile psychophysics, that is, quantification of the behavioral capacities supported by whisker sensation. The opportunity to join these two lines of investigation makes whisker-mediated sensation an exciting platform for the study of the neuronal bases of perception and decision-making. Even more appealing is the beginning-to-end prospective offered by this system: the inquiry can start at the level of the sensory receptor and conclude with the animal's choice. We argue that rats can switch between two modes of operation of the whisker sensory system: (1) generative mode and (2) receptive mode. In the generative mode, the rat moves its whiskers forward and backward to actively seek contact with objects and to palpate the object after initial contact. In the receptive mode, the rat immobilizes its whiskers to optimize the collection of signals from an object that is moving by its own power. We describe behavioral tasks that rats perform in these different modes. Next, we explore which neuronal codes in sensory cortex account for the rats' discrimination capacities. Finally, we present hypotheses for mechanisms through which ""downstream"" brain regions may read out the activity of sensory cortex in order to extract the significance of sensory stimuli and, ultimately, to select the appropriate action.","Psychometric functions are often interpreted in the context of Signal Detection Theory, which emphasizes a distinction between sensory processing and non-sensory decision rules in the brain. This framework has helped to relate perceptual sensitivity to the ""neurometric"" sensitivity of sensory-driven neural activity. However, perceptual sensitivity, as interpreted via Signal Detection Theory, is based on not just how the brain represents relevant sensory information, but also how that information is read out to form the decision variable to which the decision rule is applied. Here we discuss recent advances in our understanding of this readout process and describe its effects on the psychometric function. In particular, we show that particular aspects of the readout process can have specific, identifiable effects on the threshold, slope, upper asymptote, time dependence, and choice dependence of psychometric functions. To illustrate these points, we emphasize studies of perceptual learning that have identified changes in the readout process that can lead to changes in these aspects of the psychometric function. We also discuss methods that have been used to distinguish contributions of the sensory representation versus its readout to psychophysical performance.","The representation of space and its function in the prefrontal cortex have been examined using a variety of behavioral tasks. Among them, since the delayed-response task requires the temporary maintenance of spatial information, this task has been used to examine the mechanisms of spatial representation. In addition, the concept of working memory to explain prefrontal functions has helped us to understand the nature and functions of space representation in the prefrontal cortex. The detailed analysis of delay-period activity observed in spatial working memory tasks has provided important information for understanding space representation in the prefrontal cortex. Directional delay-period activity has been shown to be a neural correlate of the mechanism for temporarily maintaining information and represent spatial information for the visual cue and the saccade. In addition, many task-related prefrontal neurons exhibit spatially selective activities. These neurons are also important components of spatial information processing. In fact, information flow from sensory-related neurons to motor-related neurons has been demonstrated, along with a change in spatial representation as the trial progresses. The dynamic functional interactions among neurons exhibiting different task-related activities and representing different aspects of information could play an essential role in information processing. In addition, information provided from other cortical or subcortical areas might also be necessary for the representation of space in the prefrontal cortex. To better understand the representation of space and its function in the prefrontal cortex, we need to understand the nature of functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and other cortical and subcortical areas.","A fundamental problem in neurobiology is to understand how brain circuits represent sensory information and how such representations give rise to perception, memory and decision-making. We demonstrate that a sensory stimulus engages multiple areas of the cerebral cortex, including primary sensory, prefrontal, premotor and motor cortices. As information transverses the cortical circuits it shows progressively more relation to perception, memory and decision reports. In particular, we show how somatosensory areas on the parietal lobe generate a parameterized representation of a tactile stimulus. This representation is maintained in working memory by prefrontal and premotor areas of the frontal lobe. The presentation of a second stimulus, that monkeys are trained to compare with the first, generates decision-related activity reflecting which stimulus had the higher frequency. Importantly, decision-related activity is observed across several cortical circuits including prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices. Sensory information is encoded by neuronal populations with opposite tuning, and suggests that a simple subtraction operation could be the underlying mechanism by which past and present sensory information is compared to generate perceptual decisions.","Phenomenological models of decision-making, including the drift-diffusion and race models, are compared with mechanistic, biologically plausible models, such as integrate-and-fire attractor neuronal network models. The attractor network models show how decision confidence is an emergent property; and make testable predictions about the neural processes (including neuronal activity and fMRI signals) involved in decision-making which indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in reward value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation in these models can help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, and for how postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making probabilistic is shown to be increased by the graded firing rate representations found in the brain, to be decreased by the diluted connectivity, and still to be significant in biologically large networks with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The stability of these systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by glutamatergic and GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical neuropsychiatry with applications to understanding schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be advantageous, and to apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term memory, long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes.","Even the simplest behaviors depend on a large number of neurons that are distributed across many brain regions. Because electrical microstimulation can change the activity of localized subsets of neurons, it has provided valuable evidence that specific neurons contribute to particular behaviors. Here we review what has been learned about cortical function from behavioral studies using microstimulation in animals and humans. Experiments that examine how microstimulation affects the perception of stimuli have shown that the effects of microstimulation are usually highly specific and can be related to the stimuli preferred by neurons at the stimulated site. Experiments that ask subjects to detect cortical microstimulation in the absence of other stimuli have provided further insights. Although subjects typically can detect microstimulation of primary sensory or motor cortex, they are generally unable to detect stimulation of most of cortex without extensive practice. With practice, however, stimulation of any part of cortex can become detected. These training effects suggest that some patterns of cortical activity cannot be readily accessed to guide behavior, but that the adult brain retains enough plasticity to learn to process novel patterns of neuronal activity arising anywhere in cortex.","The accumulation of amyloid-β-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-β peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-β. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta resulting in dopamine deficiency in the striatum. Although majority of the PD cases are sporadic several genetic mutations have also been linked to the disease thus providing new opportunities to study the pathology of the illness. Studies in humans and various animal models of PD reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction might be a defect that occurs early in PD pathogenesis and appears to be a widespread feature in both sporadic and monogenic forms of PD. The general mitochondrial abnormalities linked with the disease include mitochondrial electron transport chain impairment, alterations in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, mitochondrial DNA mutations and anomaly in calcium homeostasis. Mitochondria are vital organelles with multiple functions and their dysfunction can lead to a decline in energy production, generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of stress-induced apoptosis. In this review, we give an outline of mitochondrial functions that are affected in the pathogenesis of sporadic and familial PD, and hence provide insights that might be valuable for focused future research to exploit possible mitochondrial targets for neuroprotective interventions in PD.","Hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injuries are leading causes of long-term mortality and disability in infants and children. Although several preclinical models using rodents of different ages have been developed, species differences in the timing of key brain maturation events can render comparisons of vulnerability and regenerative capacities difficult to interpret. Traditional models of developmental brain injury have utilized rodents at postnatal day 7-10 as being roughly equivalent to a term human infant, based historically on the measurement of post-mortem brain weights during the 1970s. Here we will examine fundamental brain development processes that occur in both rodents and humans, to delineate a comparable time course of postnatal brain development across species. We consider the timing of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, oligodendrocyte maturation and age-dependent behaviors that coincide with developmentally regulated molecular and biochemical changes. In general, while the time scale is considerably different, the sequence of key events in brain maturation is largely consistent between humans and rodents. Further, there are distinct parallels in regional vulnerability as well as functional consequences in response to brain injuries. With a focus on developmental hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and traumatic brain injury, this review offers guidelines for researchers when considering the most appropriate rodent age for the developmental stage or process of interest to approximate human brain development.","Acute ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury are a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Due to the paucity of therapies, there is a pressing clinical demand for new treatment options. Successful therapeutic strategies for these conditions must target multiple pathophysiological mechanisms occurring at different stages of brain injury. In this respect, the kallikrein-kinin system is an ideal target linking key pathological hallmarks of ischemic and traumatic brain damage such as edema formation, inflammation, and thrombosis. In particular, the kinin receptors, plasma kallikrein, and coagulation factor XIIa are highly attractive candidates for pharmacological development, as kinin receptor antagonists or inhibitors of plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XIIa are neuroprotective in animal models of stroke and traumatic brain injury. Nevertheless, conflicting preclinical evaluation as well as limited and inconclusive data from clinical trials suggest caution when transferring observations made in animals into the human situation. This review summarizes current evidence on the pathological significance of the kallikrein-kinin system during ischemic and traumatic brain damage, with a particular focus on experimental data derived from animal models. Experimental findings are also compared with human data if available, and potential therapeutic implications are discussed.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects the central nervous system (CNS) white matter, and for which no effective cure exists. Indeed, whether the primary event in MS pathology affects myelin or axons of the CNS remains unclear. Animal models are necessary to identify the immunopathological mechanisms involved in MS and to develop novel therapeutic and reparative approaches. Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology. The Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model is one of the most commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS. This review will discuss the immunopathological mechanisms involved in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The TMEV model reproduces a chronic progressive disease due to the persistence of the virus for the entire lifespan in susceptible mice. The evolution and significance of the axonal damage and neuroinflammation, the importance of epitope spread from viral to myelin epitopes, the presence of abortive remyelination and the existence of a brain pathology in addition to the classical spinal cord demyelination, are some of the findings that will be discussed in the context of this TMEV-IDD model. Despite their limitations, viral models remain an important tool to study the etiology of MS, and to understand the clinical and pathological variability associated with this disease.","FIG4 (Sac3 in mammals) is a 5'-phosphoinositide phosphatase that coordinates the turnover of phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P(2)), a very low abundance phosphoinositide. Deficiency of FIG4 severely affects the human and mouse nervous systems by causing two distinct forms of abnormal lysosomal storage. The first form occurs in spinal sensory neurons, where vacuolated endolysosomes accumulate in perinuclear regions. A second form occurs in cortical/spinal motor neurons and glia, in which enlarged endolysosomes become filled with electron dense materials in a manner indistinguishable from other lysosomal storage disorders. Humans with a deficiency of FIG4 (known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J or CMT4J) present with clinical and pathophysiological phenotypes indicative of spinal motor neuron degeneration and segmental demyelination. These findings reveal a signaling pathway involving FIG4 that appears to be important for lysosomal function. In this review, we discuss the biology of FIG4 and describe how the deficiency of FIG4 results in lysosomal phenotypes. We also discuss the implications of FIG4/PI(3,5)P(2) signaling in understanding other lysosomal storage diseases, neuropathies, and acquired demyelinating diseases.","The psychostimulants methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), amphetamine (Adderall), and modafinil (Provigil) are widely used in the treatment of medical conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy and, increasingly, as ""cognitive enhancers"" by healthy people. The long-term neuronal effects of these drugs, however, are poorly understood. A substantial amount of research over the past two decades has investigated the effects of psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines on gene regulation in the brain because these molecular changes are considered critical for psychostimulant addiction. This work has determined in some detail the neurochemical and cellular mechanisms that mediate psychostimulant-induced gene regulation and has also identified the neuronal systems altered by these drugs. Among the most affected brain systems are corticostriatal circuits, which are part of cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loops that mediate motivated behavior. The neurotransmitters critical for such gene regulation are dopamine in interaction with glutamate, while other neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin) play modulatory roles. This review presents (1) an overview of the main findings on cocaine- and amphetamine-induced gene regulation in corticostriatal circuits in an effort to provide a cellular framework for (2) an assessment of the molecular changes produced by methylphenidate, medical amphetamine (Adderall), and modafinil. The findings lead to the conclusion that protracted exposure to these cognitive enhancers can induce gene regulation effects in corticostriatal circuits that are qualitatively similar to those of cocaine and other amphetamines. These neuronal changes may contribute to the addiction liability of the psychostimulant cognitive enhancers.","Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although it is known that the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to this relationship, the detailed mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) molecular chaperone sigma-1 receptor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) play a role in the pathophysiology of CVD and depression. Several meta-analysis studies have showed that levels of BDNF in the blood of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are lower than normal controls, indicating that blood BDNF might be a biomarker for depression. Furthermore, blood levels of BDNF in patients with CVD are also lower than normal controls. A recent study using conditional BDNF knock-out mice in animal models of myocardial infarction highlighted the role of CNS-mediated mechanisms in the cardioprotective effects of BDNF. In addition, a recent study shows that decreased levels of sigma-1 receptor in the mouse brain contribute to the association between heart failure and depression. Moreover, sigma-1 receptor agonists, including the endogenous neurosteroid dehydroepiandosterone (DHEA) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine, show potent cardioprotective and antidepressive effects in rodents, via sigma-1 receptor stimulation. Interestingly, agonist activation of sigma-1 receptors increased the secretion of mature BDNF from its precursor proBDNF via chaperone activity in the ER. Given the role of ER stress in the pathophysiology of CVD and MDD, the author will discuss the potential link between sigma-1 receptors and BDNF-TrkB pathway in the pathophysiology of these two diseases. Finally, the author will make a case for potent sigma-1 receptor agonists and TrkB agonists as new potential therapeutic drugs for depressive patients with CVD.","Recent behavioral, pharmacological and molecular findings have linked the NPS system to drug dependence. Most of the evidence supports the possibility that increased NPS activity may contribute to shaping vulnerability to addiction, especially relapse. However, data suggesting that the anxiolytic-like properties of NPS may have protective effects on addiction have been also published. In addition, evidence from conditioned place preference experiments, though not unequivocal, suggests that NPS per se is devoid of motivational properties. Intriguingly, several effects of NPS on drugs of abuse appear to be mediated by downstream activation of brain corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and hypocretin-1/orexin-A (Hcrt-1/Ox-A) systems. The major objective of the present article is to review the existing work on NPS and addiction. Particular attention is devoted to the interpretation of findings revealing complex neuroanatomical and functional interactions between NPS, CRF, and the Hcrt-1/Ox-A systems. Original data aimed at shedding light on the role of NPS in reward processing are also shown. Finally, existing findings are discussed within the framework of addiction theories, and the potential of the NPS system as a treatment target for addiction is analyzed.","Phase II metabolic enzymes are a battery of critical proteins that detoxify xenobiotics by increasing their hydrophilicity and enhancing their disposal. These enzymes have long been studied for their preventative and protective effects against mutagens and carcinogens and for their regulation via the Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1)/Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2)/ARE (antioxidant response elements) pathway. Recently, a series of studies have reported the altered expression of phase II genes in postmortem tissue of patients with various neurological diseases. These observations hint at a role for phase II enzymes in the evolution of such conditions. Furthermore, promising findings reveal that overexpression of phase II genes, either by genetic or chemical approaches, confers neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, there is a need to summarize the current literature on phase II genes in the central nervous system (CNS). This should help guide future studies on phase II genes as therapeutic targets in neurological diseases. In this review, we first briefly introduce the concept of phase I, II and III enzymes, with a special focus on phase II enzymes. We then discuss their expression regulation, their inducers and executors. Following this background, we expand our discussion to the neuroprotective effects of phase II enzymes and the potential application of Nrf2 inducers to the treatment of neurological diseases.","We review recent evidence for a novel type of fast cortical oscillatory activity that occurs circumscribed between 110 and 160Hz, which we refer to as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). HFOs characteristically occur modulated by theta phase in the hippocampus and neocortex. HFOs can co-occur with gamma oscillations nested in the same theta cycle, in which case they typically peak at different theta phases. Despite the overlapping frequency ranges, HFOs differ from hippocampal ripple oscillations in some key characteristics, including amplitude, region of occurrence, associated behavioral state, and activity time-course (sustained vs intermittent). Recent in vitro evidence suggests that HFOs depend on fast GABAergic transmission and may also depend on axonal gap junctions. The functional role of HFOs is currently unclear. Both hippocampal and neocortical theta-HFO coupling increase during REM sleep, suggesting a role for HFOs in memory processing.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most important cause of dementia in the elderly. The molecular alterations preceding this neurodegenerative pathology may take place even 20 years before its clinical appearance. In this context, the discovery of biomarkers in biological fluids enabling an early presymptomatic diagnosis as well as discrimination from other types of dementia is eagerly awaited. In particular, since the traditional markers obtained both from cerebrospinal fluid inspection and neuroimaging approaches have not achieved a broad clinical application, research efforts have been focused on the development and validation of biomarkers in blood. The benefit of searching for blood-based candidate biomarkers is evident due to the easiness and non-invasiveness nature of blood samples collection compared with any other body fluid. As a result, blood may constitute a rich source of disease biomarkers. Interestingly, among the technological platforms used to perform research into the biomarker discovery arena, proteomics has attained more recent consideration. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of patterns of biomarkers detected in plasma and serum specimens for the diagnosis of AD by employing proteomic approaches. Currently, growing evidence suggests that blood protein signatures are helpful to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis of AD. Accordingly, this area of research promises to yield exciting results in the next future.","Biomarker discovery is an application of major importance in today's proteomic research. There is an urgent need for suitable biomarkers to improve diagnostic tools and treatment in various neurological diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders. Recent years have witnessed an enormous interest in proteomics, which is currently seen as an invaluable tool to shed more light on complex interacting signalling pathways and molecular networks involved in several neuropathological conditions. However, while first results of proteomic research studies have sparked much public attention, the momentum of further proteomic biomarker research in neurological disorders may suffer by its very complex methodology which is sensitive to various sources of artefacts. A major source of variability is proteome perturbation caused by sample handling/preservation (preanalytical phase) and processing/measurement (analytical phase). The aim of the present review is to summarize the current literature focusing on the crucial role played by preanalytical and analytical factors that affect the quality of samples and the reliability of the data produced in blood-based proteomic biomarker research in neurology, which may apply to Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other neurological disorders. Procedures for sample preparation and protocols for the analysis of serum and plasma samples will be delineated. Finally, the potential usefulness of bioinformatics--allowing for the assembly, store, and processing of data--as well as its contribution to the execution of proteomic studies will be critically discussed.","Neurodegenerative diseases constitute one of the single most important public health challenges of the coming decades, and yet we presently have only a limited understanding of the underlying genetic, cellular and molecular causes. As a result, no effective disease-modifying therapies are currently available, and no method exists to allow detection at early disease stages, and as a result diagnoses are only made decades after disease pathogenesis, by which time the majority of physical damage has already occurred. Since the sequencing of the human genome, we have come to appreciate that the transcriptional output of the human genome is extremely rich in non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This heterogeneous class of transcripts is widely expressed in the nervous system, and is likely to play many crucial roles in the development and functioning of this organ. Most exciting, evidence has recently been presented that ncRNAs play central, but hitherto unappreciated roles in neurodegenerative processes. Here, we review the diverse available evidence demonstrating involvement of ncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss their possible implications in the development of therapies and biomarkers for these conditions.","Neurodegenerative diseases affect the lives of millions of patients and their families. Due to the complexity of these diseases and our limited understanding of their pathogenesis, the design of therapeutic agents that can effectively treat these diseases has been challenging. Huntington disease (HD) is one of several neurological disorders with few therapeutic options. HD, like numerous other neurodegenerative diseases, involves extensive neuronal cell loss. One potential strategy to combat HD and other neurodegenerative disorders is to intervene in the execution of neuronal cell death. Inhibiting neuronal cell death pathways may slow the development of neurodegeneration. However, discovering small molecule inhibitors of neuronal cell death remains a significant challenge. Here, we review candidate therapeutic targets controlling cell death mechanisms that have been the focus of research in HD, as well as an emerging strategy that has been applied to developing small molecule inhibitors-fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). FBDD has been successfully used in both industry and academia to identify selective and potent small molecule inhibitors, with a focus on challenging proteins that are not amenable to traditional high-throughput screening approaches. FBDD has been used to generate potent leads, pre-clinical candidates, and has led to the development of an FDA approved drug. This approach can be valuable for identifying modulators of cell-death-regulating proteins; such compounds may prove to be the key to halting the progression of HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.","APP mutations cause Alzheimer disease (AD) with virtually complete penetrance. We found a novel APP mutation (A673V) in the homozygous state in a patient with early-onset AD-type dementia and in his younger sister showing initial signs of cognitive decline. It is noteworthy that the heterozygous relatives were not affected, suggesting that this mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Studies on molecular events for the recessive mutation in causing disease revealed a double synergistic effect: the A673V APP variant shifts APP processing towards the amyloidogenic pathway with increased production of Aβ peptides and it markedly enhances the aggregation and fibrillogenic properties of both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. However, co-incubation of mutated and wild-type (wt) Aβ species resulted in inhibition of amyloidogenesis, consistent with the observation that heterozygous carriers do not develop the disease. The opposite effects of the A673V mutation in the homozygous and heterozygous state on amyloidogenesis account for the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, revealing a new scenario in AD genetics and pathogenesis. The anti-amyloidogenic properties of this novel human Aβ variant may offer grounds for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD based on modified Aβ peptides. Indeed, the interaction between mutated Aβ1-6 and wt full-length Aβ prevents amyloid fibril formation. The anti-amyloidogenic effect is further amplified by the use of a mutated six-mer peptide, constructed entirely from D-amino acids to increase the its stability in vivo. Here we reviewed the studies on pathogenic mechanisms associated with the A673V mutation and the first experimental steps toward the development of a novel disease-modifying therapy for AD.","Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is unique among the polyglutamine diseases in that the toxicity of the mutant protein, the androgen receptor, is ligand-dependent. In cell culture and animal models the mutant androgen receptor causes protein aggregation and alterations in transcriptional regulation, axonal transport, and mitochondrial function. Various therapeutic approaches have shown efficacy in mouse models, including androgen reduction and agents that alter the processing and degradation of the mutant androgen receptor protein, such as HSP90 inhibitors, IGF-1, and ASC-J9. Clinical trials of androgen-reducing agents have shown indications of efficacy but not proof of clinically meaningful benefit to date. This trial experience has set the stage for future clinical studies of other agents that have been found to be beneficial in transgenic animal models.","Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a late-onset motor neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. During the last two decades, basic and clinical research has provided important insights into the disease phenotype and pathophysiology. The cause of SBMA is the expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine tract within the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA exclusively affects adult males, whereas females homozygous for the AR mutation do not manifest neurological symptoms. The ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of the polyglutamine-expanded AR protein is central to the gender-specific pathogenesis of SBMA, although additional steps, e.g., DNA binding, inter-domain interactions, and post-translational modification of AR, modify toxicity. The interactions with co-regulators are another requisite for the toxic properties of the polyglutamine-expanded AR. It is also shown that the polyglutamine-expanded AR induces diverse molecular events, such as transcriptional dysregulation, axonal transport disruption, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which play causative roles in the neurodegeneration in SBMA. The pathogenic AR-induced myopathy also contributes to the non-cell autonomous degeneration of motor neurons. Pre-clinical studies using animal models show that the pathogenic AR-mediated neurodegeneration is suppressed by androgen inactivation, the efficacy of which has been tested in clinical trials. Pharmacological activation of cellular defense machineries, such as molecular chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy, also exerts neuroprotective effects in experimental models of SBMA.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one an intriguing set of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat where the repeat is located within the coding of the affected gene, i.e. the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. A gain-of-function mechanism for toxicity in SCA1, like the other polyQ diseases, is thought to have a major role in pathogenesis. Yet, the specific nature of this gain-of-function is a matter of considerable discussion. An issue concerns whether toxicity stems from the native or normal function of the affected protein versus a novel function induced by polyQ expansion. For SCA1 considerable evidence is accumulating that pathology is mediated by a polyQ-induced exaggeration of a native function of the host protein Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) and that phosphorylation of S776 regulates its interaction with other cellular protein and thereby function. In addition, this posttranslational modification modulates toxicity of ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine.","Although it is well established that axonal transport defects are part of the initiation or progression of some neurodegenerative diseases, the precise role of these defects in disease development is poorly understood. Thus, in this article, rather than enumerate the already well-reviewed evidence that there are transport deficits in disease, I will focus on a discussion of two crucial and unanswered questions about the possible role of axonal transport defects in HD and AD. (1) Are alterations in axonal transport caused by changes in the normal function of proteins mutated or altered in HD and AD and/or do such alterations in transport occur as a result of the formation of toxic aggregates of peptides or proteins? (2) Do alterations in axonal transport contribute to the causes of HD and AD or are they early, or late, secondary consequences of other cellular defects caused by disease-induction?","Mutations of genes whose primary function is the regulation of membrane traffic are increasingly being identified as the underlying causes of various important human disorders. Intriguingly, mutations in ubiquitously expressed membrane traffic genes often lead to cell type- or organ-specific disorders. This is particularly true for neuronal diseases, identifying the nervous system as the most sensitive tissue to alterations of membrane traffic. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is one of the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies. It is also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), which comprises a group of disorders specifically affecting peripheral nerves. This peripheral neuropathy, highly heterogeneous both clinically and genetically, is characterized by a slowly progressive degeneration of the muscle of the foot, lower leg, hand and forearm, accompanied by sensory loss in the toes, fingers and limbs. More than 30 genes have been identified as targets of mutations that cause CMT neuropathy. A number of these genes encode proteins directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of intracellular traffic. Indeed, the list of genes linked to CMT disease includes genes important for vesicle formation, phosphoinositide metabolism, lysosomal degradation, mitochondrial fission and fusion, and also genes encoding endosomal and cytoskeletal proteins. This review focuses on the link between intracellular transport and CMT disease, highlighting the molecular mechanisms that underlie the different forms of this peripheral neuropathy and discussing the pathophysiological impact of membrane transport genetic defects as well as possible future ways to counteract these defects.","Amyloid diseases display the presence, in targeted tissues and organs, of fibrillar deposits of specific peptides or proteins. Increasing efforts are presently spent in investigating the structural features and the structure-toxicity relation of the soluble oligomeric precursors arising in the path of fibrillization as well as the importance of surfaces as triggers of protein misfolding and aggregation and as possible responsible for amyloid polymorphism. Presently, it is recognized that the unstable, heterogeneous pre-fibrillar aggregates are the main responsible for amyloid toxicity. Conversely, mature fibrils are considered stable, harmless reservoirs of toxic species, although direct fibril toxicity has been reported. Recent studies show that mature fibrils grown at various conditions can display different structural features, stabilities and tendency to disassemble with leak of toxic oligomers. Fibril polymorphism can result from protein aggregation at differing conditions populating misfolded monomers and oligomers with distinct conformational characteristics. Recent research has started to unravel oligomer structural and biophysical features and their relation to cytotoxicity. Increasing information supports the notion that oligomer-membrane interaction, disruption of membrane integrity and cell impairment results from both oligomer and membrane biophysical features; accordingly, the formation of the oligomer-membrane complex, often the first step of amyloid toxicity, can be the result of the interplay of these events. This view can help explaining the variable vulnerability of different cell types to the same amyloids and the lack of relation between amyloid load and severity of clinical symptoms; it also stresses the importance, for cell/tissue impairment, of the presence of fibrils conformers of reduced stability as a possible source of oligomers resulting from leakage possibly favored by the interaction with suitable macromolecular/lipid surfaces or by other environmental conditions.","Neurodegenerative disorders affect a significant portion of the world's population leading to either disability or death for almost 30 million individuals worldwide. One novel therapeutic target that may offer promise for multiple disease entities that involve Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, trauma, stroke, and tumors of the nervous system is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR signaling is dependent upon the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes that are composed of mTOR and several regulatory proteins including the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1, hamartin/TSC2, tuberin). Through a number of integrated cell signaling pathways that involve those of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as well as more novel signaling tied to cytokines, Wnt, and forkhead, mTOR can foster stem cellular proliferation, tissue repair and longevity, and synaptic growth by modulating mechanisms that foster both apoptosis and autophagy. Yet, mTOR through its proliferative capacity may sometimes be detrimental to central nervous system recovery and even promote tumorigenesis. Further knowledge of mTOR and the critical pathways governed by this serine/threonine protein kinase can bring new light for neurodegeneration and other related diseases that currently require new and robust treatments.","This paper reviews recent progress in understanding the functional roles of inhibitory interneurons in behaving animals and how they affect information processing in cortical microcircuits. Multiple studies have shown that the morphological subtypes of inhibitory cells show distinct electrophysiological properties, as well as different molecular and neurochemical identities, providing a large mosaic of inhibitory mechanisms for the dynamic processing of information in the cortex. However, it is only recently that some specific functions of different interneuronal subtypes have been described in behaving animals. In this regard, influential results have been obtained using the known differences of interneurons and pyramidal cells recorded extracellularly to dissociate the functional roles that these two classes of neurons may play in the cortical microcircuits during various behaviors. Neurons can be segregated into fast-spiking (FS) cells that show short action potentials, high discharge rates, and correspond to putative interneurons; and regular-spiking (RS) cells that show larger action potentials and correspond to pyramidal neurons. Using this classification strategy, it has been found that cortical inhibition is involved in sculpting the tuning to different stimulus or behavioral features across a wide variety of sensory, association, and motor areas. Recent studies have suggested that the increase in high-frequency synchronization during information processing and spatial attention may be mediated by FS activation. Finally, FS are active during motor planning and movement execution in different motor areas, supporting the notion that inhibitory interneurons are involved in shaping the motor command but not in gating the cortical output.","In analogy with the accepted view that behaviour is shaped by gene×environment (G×E) interactions, G×E studies are exponentially increasing in the field of psychiatry. Whereas research was primarily driven by the premature view that negative environmental stimuli can trigger psychopathology in those subjects that are genetically predisposed, a closer look at the available data shows that G×E interactions are much more complex than initially thought. Here, we discuss G×E studies focussing on serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) gene variation in humans, monkeys, and rodents. Recent studies, across species, confirm the theorized 'for-better-and-for-worse' effect of low activity serotonin transporter genotypes. In addition, while 5-HTT×E interactions were thought to take place in early life, recent evidence illustrates that these interactions are also manifested in adulthood. Therefore, we discuss data based on 5-HTT×E interactions, and propose a model in which predictive adaptive responses (PARs), as shaped by early life 5-HTT×E interactions, shape responses to environmental challenges in later life, i.e. reflecting 5-HTT×E×E interactions.","Aging and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are characterized by tissue and mitochondrial changes that compromise brain function. Alterations can include increased reactive oxygen species production and impaired antioxidant capacity with a consequent increase in oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction that compromises brain ATP production, and ultimately increased apoptotic signaling and neuronal death. Among several non-pharmacological strategies to prevent brain degeneration, physical exercise is a surprisingly effective strategy, which antagonizes brain tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present review aims to discuss the role of physical exercise in the modulation of the mechanisms involved in neuroprotection including the activation of signaling pathways underlying brain protection.","Fatigue is a symptom associated with many disorders, is especially common in women and in older adults, and can have a huge negative influence on quality of life. Although most past research on fatigue uses human subjects instead of animal models, the use of appropriate animal models has recently begun to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of fatigue. In this review, results from animal models using immunological, developmental, or physical approaches to study fatigue are described and compared. Common across these animal models is that fatigue arises when a stimulus induces activation of microglia and/or increased cytokines and chemokines in the brain. Neurobiological studies implicate structures in the ascending arousal system, sleep executive control areas, and areas important in reward. In addition, the suprachiasmatic nucleus clearly plays an important role in homeostatic regulation of the neural network mediating fatigue. This nucleus responds to cytokines, shows decreased amplitude firing rate output in models of fatigue, and responds to exercise, one of our few treatments for fatigue. This is a young field but very important as the symptom of fatigue is common across many disorders and we do not have effective treatments.","Cardiovascular and neuroendocrine reactivity to acute stress are important predictors of health outcomes in non-pregnant populations. Greater magnitude and duration of physiological responses have been associated with increased risk of hypertensive disorders and diabetes, greater susceptibility to infectious illnesses, suppression of cell-mediated immunity as well as risk for depression and anxiety disorders. Stress reactivity during pregnancy has unique implications for maternal health, birth outcomes, and fetal development. However, as compared to the larger literature, our understanding of the predictors and consequences of exaggerated stress reactivity in pregnancy is limited. This paper reviews the current state of this literature with an emphasis on gaps in knowledge and future directions.","Memory consolidation refers to a slow process that stabilises a memory trace after initial acquisition of novel events. The consolidation theory posits that once a memory is stored in the brain, it remains fixed for the lifetime of the memory. However, compelling evidence has suggested that upon recall, memories can re-enter a state of transient instability, requiring further stabilisation to be available once again for recall. Since its rehabilitation in the past ten years, this process of reconsolidation of memory after recall stimulated intense debates in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In this review we compile this plentiful literature with a particular emphasis on some of the key questions that have emerged from the reconsolidation theory. We focus on tracing the characterisation of the boundary conditions that constrain the occurrence of memory reconsolidation. We also discuss accumulating evidence supporting the idea that reconsolidation, as implied by its definition, is not a mere repetition of consolidation. We review seminal studies that uncovered specific mechanisms recruited during reconsolidation that are not always crucially involved in consolidation. We next address the physiological significance of reconsolidation since several lines of evidence support the idea that reconsolidation, as opposed to consolidation, may offer a unique opportunity to update memories. We finally discuss recent evidence for or against the potential that the process of memory reconsolidation offers for ongoing efforts to develop novel strategies to combat pathogenic memories.","Common neurodevelopmental disorders (including autism, speech and language delay, schizophrenia, epilepsy and intellectual disability) have complex aetiology, which is predominantly genomic, but also environmental in origin. They share a paradox, in that high heritability is matched by lowered fecundity, placing them under negative genetic selection. This implicates variants of recent origin, such as de novo mutations or common, very low-risk polymorphisms that escape negative selection. High or moderate risk variants have been discovered by chromosome analysis, genome sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) detection, including a 3Mb deletion causing 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome) that has penetrance of up to 50% for schizophrenia. More recently, rare, recurrent and often de novo pathogenic CNVs, including deletions at NRXN1, 1q21.2, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3, 16p11.2 and duplications at VIPR2 and 16p13.11, have also been discovered. These have several unique features that differentiate them from Mendelian disease mutations in that they have incomplete penetrance, with moderate-to-high odds ratios for risk, and show diagnostic pleiotropy, increasing risk across the neurodevelopmental disorder spectrum. Some are also syndromic, with characteristic features such as facial dysmorphology, and other specific risks such as aortic dissection or obesity, implying that they might be better classified as distinct diagnoses. The discovery of pathogenic CNVs provide new opportunities for translation leading to patent benefit, including improvements in clinical genetic diagnosis and genetic counselling, the possibility of clinician decision-making tools for risk prediction, and the identification of drug targets and implementation of personalised medicine using stratification by genotype.","The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons forming an intricate network of innumerable connections, which continuously adapt and rewire themselves following inputs from external and internal environments as well as the physiological synaptic, dendritic and axonal sculpture during brain maturation and throughout the life span. Growing evidence supports the idea that Alzheimer's disease (AD) targets selected and functionally connected neuronal networks and, specifically, their synaptic terminals, affecting brain connectivity well before producing neuronal loss and compartmental atrophy. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the dismantling of neuronal circuits and the implementation of 'clinically oriented' methods to map-out the dynamic interactions amongst neuronal assemblies will enhance early/pre-symptomatic diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. More important, this will open the avenues to innovative treatments, bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms and the variety of symptoms forming disease phenotype. In the present review a set of evidence supports the idea that altered brain connectivity, exhausted neural plasticity and aberrant neuronal activity are facets of the same coin linked to age-related neurodegenerative dementia of Alzheimer type. Investigating their respective roles in AD pathophysiology will help in translating findings from basic research to clinical applications.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major neurodegenerative diseases that deteriorates cognitive functions and primarily affects associated brain regions involved in learning and memory, such as the neocortex and the hippocampus. Following the discovery and establishment of its role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), was found to be involved in a multitude of neurophysiological processes including mnesic function, through its dedicated pathways and interaction with cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and dopaminergic transmission systems. Abnormal 5-HT neurotransmission contributes to the deterioration of cognitive processes in ageing, AD and other neuropathologies, including schizophrenia, stress, mood disorders and depression. Numerous studies have confirmed the pathophysiological role of the 5-HT system in AD and that several drugs enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission are effective in treating the AD-related cognitive and behavioural deficits. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the role of serotonergic neurotransmission in brain development, maturation and ageing, discuss its role in higher brain function and provide an in depth account of pathological modifications of serotonergic transmission in neurological diseases and AD.","One of the most consistent genetic findings to have emerged from bipolar disorder genome wide association studies (GWAS) is with CACNA1C, a gene that codes for the α(1C) subunit of the Ca(v)1.2 voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (LTCC). Genetic variation in CACNA1C have also been associated with depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, as well as changes in brain function and structure in control subjects who have no diagnosable psychiatric illness. These data are consistent with a continuum of shared neurobiological vulnerability between diverse-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) defined-neuropsychiatric diseases. While involved in numerous cellular functions, Ca(v)1.2 is most frequently implicated in coupling of cell membrane depolarization to transient increase of the membrane permeability for calcium, leading to activation and, potentially, changes in intracellular signaling pathway activity, gene transcription, and synaptic plasticity. Ca(v)1.2 is involved in the proper function of numerous neurological circuits including those involving the hippocampus, amygdala, and mesolimbic reward system, which are strongly implicated in psychiatric disease pathophysiology. A number of behavioral effects of LTCC inhibitors have been described including antidepressant-like behavioral actions in rodent models. Clinical studies suggest possible treatment effects in a subset of patients with mood disorders. We review the genetic structure and variation of CACNA1C, discussing relevant human genetic and clinical findings, as well as the biological actions of Ca(v)1.2 that are most relevant to psychiatric illness.","Human intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are primarily performed in epileptic patients for presurgical mapping. When patients perform cognitive tasks, iEEG signals reveal high-frequency neural activities (HFAs, between around 40 Hz and 150 Hz) with exquisite anatomical, functional and temporal specificity. Such HFAs were originally interpreted in the context of perceptual or motor binding, in line with animal studies on gamma-band ('40 Hz') neural synchronization. Today, our understanding of HFA has evolved into a more general index of cortical processing: task-induced HFA reveals, with excellent spatial and time resolution, the participation of local neural ensembles in the task-at-hand, and perhaps the neural communication mechanisms allowing them to do so. This review promotes the claim that studying HFA with iEEG provides insights into the neural bases of cognition that cannot be derived as easily from other approaches, such as fMRI. We provide a series of examples supporting that claim, drawn from studies on memory, language and default-mode networks, and successful attempts of real-time functional mapping. These examples are followed by several guidelines for HFA research, intended for new groups interested by this approach. Overall, iEEG research on HFA should play an increasing role in cognitive neuroscience in humans, because it can be explicitly linked to basic research in animals. We conclude by discussing the future evolution of this field, which might expand that role even further, for instance through the use of multi-scale electrodes and the fusion of iEEG with MEG and fMRI.", ,"Epilepsy is one of the most frequent neurological diseases. In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability. Large multicenter prospective studies are needed prior to widespread clinical application.","High frequency oscillations (HFOs) constitute a novel trend in neurophysiology that is fascinating neuroscientists in general, and epileptologists in particular. But what are HFOs? What is the frequency range of HFOs? Are there different types of HFOs, physiological and pathological? How are HFOs generated? Can HFOs represent temporal codes for cognitive processes? These questions are pressing and this symposium volume attempts to give constructive answers. As a prelude to this exciting discussion, we summarize the physiological high frequency patterns in the intact brain, concentrating mainly on hippocampal patterns, where the mechanisms of high frequency oscillations are perhaps best understood.","In recent years, new recording technologies have advanced such that, at high temporal and spatial resolutions, high-frequency oscillations (HFO) can be recorded in human partial epilepsy. However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions.","High frequency oscillations (HFO) have a variety of characteristics: band-limited or broad-band, transient burst-like phenomenon or steady-state. HFOs may be encountered under physiological or under pathological conditions (pHFO). Here we review the underlying mechanisms of oscillations, at the level of cells and networks, investigated in a variety of experimental in vitro and in vivo models. Diverse mechanisms are described, from intrinsic membrane oscillations to network processes involving different types of synaptic interactions, gap junctions and ephaptic coupling. HFOs with similar frequency ranges can differ considerably in their physiological mechanisms. The fact that in most cases the combination of intrinsic neuronal membrane oscillations and synaptic circuits are necessary to sustain network oscillations is emphasized. Evidence for pathological HFOs, particularly fast ripples, in experimental models of epilepsy and in human epileptic patients is scrutinized. The underlying mechanisms of fast ripples are examined both in the light of animal observations, in vivo and in vitro, and in epileptic patients, with emphasis on single cell dynamics. Experimental observations and computational modeling have led to hypotheses for these mechanisms, several of which are considered here, namely the role of out-of-phase firing in neuronal clusters, the importance of strong excitatory AMPA-synaptic currents and recurrent inhibitory connectivity in combination with the fast time scales of IPSPs, ephaptic coupling and the contribution of interneuronal coupling through gap junctions. The statistical behaviour of fast ripple events can provide useful information on the underlying mechanism and can help to further improve classification of the diverse forms of HFOs.","High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are EEG field potentials with frequencies higher than 30 Hz; commonly the frequency band between 30 and 70 Hz is denominated the gamma band, but with the discovery of activities at frequencies higher than 70 Hz a variety of terms have been proposed to describe the latter (Gotman and Crone, 2011). In general we may consider that the term HFO encompasses activities from 30 to 600 Hz. The best practice is to indicate always explicitly the frequency range of the HFOs in any specific study. There are numerous types of HFOs: those in normal brain appear to facilitate synchronization and information transfer necessary for cognitive processes and memory, while a particular class of HFOs in the brain of animals and people with epilepsy appears to reflect fundamental mechanisms of epileptic phenomena and could serve as biomarkers of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity in abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. A better understanding of the significance of HFOs depends on a deeper analysis of the mechanisms of generation of different kinds of HFOs, that typically are at the crossroads between intrinsic membrane properties and neuronal interactions, both chemical and electrical. There is still a lack of understanding of how specific information is carried by HFOs and can be operational in normal cognitive processes such as in working and long-term memory and abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. The complexity of these processes makes the development of relevant computational models of dynamical neuronal networks most compelling.","Recent data has indicated that the traditional view of Parkinson's disease (PD) as an isolated disorder of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system alone is an oversimplification of its complex symptomatology. Aside from classical motor deficits, various non-motor symptoms including autonomic dysfunction, sensory and cognitive impairments as well as neuropsychiatric alterations and sleep disturbances are common in PD. Some of these non-motor symptoms can even antedate the motor problems. Many of them are associated with extranigral neuropathological changes, such as extensive α-synuclein pathology and also neuroinflammatory responses in specific brain regions, i.e. microglial activation, which has been implicated in several aspects of PD pathogenesis and progression. However, microglia do not represent a uniform population, but comprise a diverse group of cells with brain region-specific phenotypes that can exert beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on the local phenotype and context. Understanding how microglia can be neuroprotective in one brain region, while promoting neurotoxicity in another, will improve our understanding of the role of microglia in neurodegeneration in general, and of their role in PD pathology in particular. Since neuroinflammatory responses are in principle modifiable, such approaches could help to identify new targets or adjunctive therapies for the full spectrum of PD-related symptoms.","Complex molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) are gradually being elucidated. Accumulating genetic evidence implicates dysfunction of kinase activities and phosphorylation pathways in the pathogenesis of PD. Causative and risk gene products associated with PD include protein kinases (such as PINK1, LRRK2 and GAK) and proteins related phosphorylation signaling pathways (such as SNCA, DJ-1). PINK1, LRRK2 and several PD gene products have been associated with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and protein kinase B (AKT) kinase signaling pathways. C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38, signaling pathways downstream of MAP, are particularly important in PD. JNK and p38 play an integral role in neuronal death. Targeting JNK or p38 signaling may offer an effective therapy for PD. Inhibitors of the ERK signaling pathway, which plays an important role in the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), have been shown to attenuate this condition in animal models. In this review, we summarize experimental evidence gathered over the last decade on the role of PINK1, LRRK2 and GAK and their related phosphorylation signaling pathways (JNK, ERK, p38 and PI3K/AKT) in PD. It is speculated that improvement or modulation of these signaling pathways will reveal potential therapeutic targets for attenuation of the cardinal symptoms and motor complications in patients with PD in the future.","The interaction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with its tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) is involved in fundamental cellular processes including neuronal proliferation, differentiation and survival as well as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. TrkB signaling has been widely associated with beneficial, trophic effects and many commonly used psychotropic drugs aim to increase BDNF levels in the brain. However, it is likely that a prolonged increased TrkB activation is observed in many pathological conditions, which may underlie the development and course of clinical symptoms. Interestingly, genetic and pharmacological studies aiming at decreasing TrkB activation in rodent models mimicking human pathology have demonstrated a promising therapeutic landscape for TrkB inhibitors in the treatment of various diseases, e.g. central nervous system (CNS) disorders and several types of cancer. Up to date, only a few selective and potent TrkB inhibitors have been developed. As such, the use of crystallography and in silico approaches to model BDNF-TrkB interaction and to generate relevant pharmacophores represent powerful tools to develop novel compounds targeting the TrkB receptor.","Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key hormone for reproductive functions in vertebrates and non-vertebrates. Although GnRH neuronal system is regulated by several factors such as steroids, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, it is not fully understood how environmental signals control the GnRH neuronal system. RFamide peptides, members of peptides possessing an Arg-Phe-NH(2) motif at their C-terminus, have recently been characterized as major regulators of GnRH neurons. In particular, two key RFamide peptides, kisspeptin and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), are emerging as important regulators of the reproductive axis. Kisspeptin acts as the accelerator, directly driving GnRH neurons, whereas GnIH acts as the restraint. In addition, other RFamide peptides such as prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), PQRFa peptide, 26RFa/QRFP are also known to control reproduction. These RFamide peptides are regulated by environmental factors such as photoperiods, steroid hormones, metabolic signals, and stress. How environmental signals are integrated by RFamide peptides to regulate reproduction through the GnRH neurons?","Growing evidence of epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies has clearly shown a close link between adverse in utero environment and the increased risk of neurological, psychological and psychiatric disorders in later life. Fetal stresses, such as hypoxia, malnutrition, and fetal exposure to nicotine, alcohol, cocaine and glucocorticoids may directly or indirectly act at cellular and molecular levels to alter the brain development and result in programming of heightened brain vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and the development of neurological diseases in the postnatal life. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood. However, glucocorticoids may play a crucial role in epigenetic programming of neurological disorders of fetal origins. This review summarizes the recent studies about the effects of fetal stress on the abnormal brain development, focusing on the cellular, molecular and epigenetic mechanisms and highlighting the central effects of glucocorticoids on programming of hypoxic-ischemic-sensitive phenotype in the neonatal brain, which may enhance the understanding of brain pathophysiology resulting from fetal stress and help explore potential targets of timely diagnosis, prevention and intervention in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and other brain disorders.","Presenilins (PSs) are catalytic components of the γ-secretase proteolytic complexes that produce Aβ and cell signaling peptides. γ-Secretase substrates are mostly membrane-bound peptides derived following proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of type I transmembrane proteins. Recent work reveals that γ-secretase substrate processing is regulated by proteins termed γ-secretase substrate recruiting factors (γSSRFs) that bridge substrates to γ-secretase complexes. These factors constitute novel targets for pharmacological control of specific γ-secretase products, such as Aβ and signaling peptides. PS familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutants cause a loss of γ-secretase cleavage function at epsilon sites of substrates thus inhibiting production of cell signaling peptides while promoting accumulation of uncleaved toxic substrates. Importantly, γ-secretase inhibitors may cause toxicity in vivo by similar mechanisms. Here we review novel mechanisms that control γ-secretase substrate selection and cleavage and examine their relevance to AD.","As the population ages, the economic and societal impacts of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders are expected to rise sharply. Like dementia, late-life depressive disorders are common and are linked to increased disability, high healthcare utilisation, cognitive decline and premature mortality. Considerable heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of major depression across the life cycle may reflect unique pathophysiological pathways to illness; differentiating those with earlier onset who have grown older (early-onset depression), from those with illness onset after the age of 50 or 60 years (late-onset depression). The last two decades have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of early- and late-onset depression, and has shown that disturbances of fronto-subcortical functioning are implicated. New biomedical models extend well beyond perturbations of traditional monoamine systems to include altered neurotrophins, endocrinologic and immunologic system dysfunction, inflammatory processes and gene expression alterations. This more recent research has highlighted that a range of illness-specific, neurodegenerative and vascular factors appear to contribute to the various phenotypic presentations. This review highlights the major features of late-life depression, with specific reference to its associated aetiological, clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, neuropathological, inflammatory and genetic correlates. Data examining the efficacy of pharmacological, non-pharmacological and novel treatments for depression are discussed. Ultimately, future research must aim to evaluate whether basic biomedical knowledge can be successfully translated into enhanced health outcomes via the implementation of early intervention paradigms.","The mammalian central nervous system, due to its interaction with the environment, must be endowed with plasticity. Conversely, the nervous tissue must be substantially static to ensure connectional invariability. Structural plasticity can be viewed as a compromise between these requirements. In adult mammals, brain structural plasticity is strongly reduced with respect to other animal groups in the phylogenetic tree. It persists under different forms, which mainly consist of remodeling of neuronal shape and connectivity, and, to a lesser extent, the production of new neurons. Adult neurogenesis is mainly restricted within two neurogenic niches, yet some gliogenic and neurogenic processes also occur in the so-called non-neurogenic tissue, starting from parenchymal progenitors. In this review we focus on a population of immature, non-newly generated neurons in layer II of the cerebral cortex, which were previously thought to be newly generated since they heavily express the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule and doublecortin. These unusual neurons exhibit characteristics defining an additional type of structural plasticity, different from either synaptic plasticity or adult neurogenesis. Evidences concerning their morphology, antigenic features, ultrastructure, phenotype, origin, fate, and reaction to different kind of stimulations are gathered and analyzed. Their possible role is discussed in the context of an enriched complexity and heterogeneity of mammalian brain structural plasticity.","Sexual behavior is critical to species survival, yet comparatively little is known about the neural mechanisms in the human brain. Here we systematically review the existing human brain imaging literature on sexual behavior and show that the functional neuroanatomy of sexual behavior is comparable to that involved in processing other rewarding stimuli. Sexual behavior clearly follows the established principles and phases for wanting, liking and satiety involved in the pleasure cycle of other rewards. The studies have uncovered the brain networks involved in sexual wanting or motivation/anticipation, as well as sexual liking or arousal/consummation, while there is very little data on sexual satiety or post-orgasmic refractory period. Human sexual behavior also interacts with other pleasures, most notably social interaction and high arousal states. We discuss the changes in the underlying brain networks supporting sexual behavior in the context of the pleasure cycle, the changes to this cycle over the individual's life-time and the interactions between them. Overall, it is clear from the data that the functional neuroanatomy of sex is very similar to that of other pleasures and that it is unlikely that there is anything special about the brain mechanisms and networks underlying sex.","Peripheral nerves injuries result in paralysis, anesthesia and lack of autonomic control of the affected body areas. After injury, axons distal to the lesion are disconnected from the neuronal body and degenerate, leading to denervation of the peripheral organs. Wallerian degeneration creates a microenvironment distal to the injury site that supports axonal regrowth, while the neuron body changes in phenotype to promote axonal regeneration. The significance of axonal regeneration is to replace the degenerated distal nerve segment, and achieve reinnervation of target organs and restitution of their functions. However, axonal regeneration does not always allows for adequate functional recovery, so that after a peripheral nerve injury, patients do not recover normal motor control and fine sensibility. The lack of specificity of nerve regeneration, in terms of motor and sensory axons regrowth, pathfinding and target reinnervation, is one the main shortcomings for recovery. Key factors for successful axonal regeneration include the intrinsic changes that neurons suffer to switch their transmitter state to a pro-regenerative state and the environment that the axons find distal to the lesion site. The molecular mechanisms implicated in axonal regeneration and pathfinding after injury are complex, and take into account the cross-talk between axons and glial cells, neurotrophic factors, extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors. The aim of this review is to look at those interactions, trying to understand if some of these molecular factors are specific for motor and sensory neuron growth, and provide the basic knowledge for potential strategies to enhance and guide axonal regeneration and reinnervation of adequate target organs.","This paper presents a theoretical review of rapid eye movement sleep with a special focus on pontine-geniculate-occipital waves and what they might tell us about the functional anatomy of sleep and consciousness. In particular, we review established ideas about the nature and purpose of sleep in terms of protoconsciousness and free energy minimization. By combining these theoretical perspectives, we discover answers to some fundamental questions about sleep: for example, why is homeothermy suspended during sleep? Why is sleep necessary? Why are we not surprised by our dreams? What is the role of synaptic regression in sleep? The imperatives for sleep that emerge also allow us to speculate about the functional role of PGO waves and make some empirical predictions that can, in principle, be tested using recent advances in the modeling of electrophysiological data.","In mammals, empathy is crucial for living in social groups and caring for others. In this paper, we consider the structural and functional organization of empathy. We propose that empathy subsumes a variety of neurobiological processes and partially dissociable information processing subsystems, each of which has a unique evolutionary history. Even the most advanced and flexible forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core subcortical and neurohormonal mechanisms associated with affective communication, parental care and social attachment processes. Considering empathy within a framework that recognizes both the continuities and the changes within a phylogenetic perspective provides a richer understanding of empathy and related neurobehavioral processes.","Nitric oxide (NO) regulates Aplysia feeding by novel mechanisms, suggesting new roles for NO in controlling the behavior of higher animals. In Aplysia, (1) NO helps maintain arousal when produced by neurons responding to attempts to swallow food; (2) NO biases the motor system to reject and reposition food that resists swallowing; (3) if mechanically resistant food is not successfully swallowed, NO mediates the formation and expression of memories of food inedibility; (4) NO production at rest inhibits feeding, countering the effects of food stimuli exciting feeding. At a cellular level, NO-dependent channels contribute to the resting potential of neurons controlling food finding and food consumption. Increases in L-arginine after animals eat act as a post-feeding inhibitory signal, presumably by modulating NO production at rest. NO also signals non-feeding behaviors that are associated with feeding inhibition. Thus, depending on context, NO may enhance or inhibit feeding behavior. The different functions of NO may reflect the evolution of NO signaling from a response to tissue damage that was then elaborated and used for additional functions. These results suggest that in higher animals (1) elicited and background transmitter release may have similar effects; (2) NO may be produced by neurons without firing, influencing adjacent neurons; (3) background NO production may contribute to a neuron's resting potential; (4) circulating factors affecting background NO production may regulate spatially separated neurons; (5) L-arginine can be used to regulate neural activity; (6) L-arginine may be an effective post-ingestion metabolic signal to regulate feeding.","The regenerative medicine techniques that are beginning to be applied to the nervous system have led to increased hope in the treatment of diseases that have been considered incurable and that require experimental models on which to test new therapeutic strategies. We present our experience with adult pigs (minipigs) that have undergone a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) experimental model, and that have been followed for 1 year. We describe the surgical aspects of our SCI model by acute compression and also describe protocols for daily care and rehabilitation that are necessary to maintain the paraplegic pigs in good health during the months following the injury. Furthermore, we provide in detail the main complications that arise with this experimental model and the treatments used to address these complications. Suitable housing conditions, daily rehabilitation and prevention of complications (i.e., taking the same care applied to patients following SCI) are essential for achieving the absence of mortality and long-term maintenance of the animals. We consider the model that is described here to be feasible and useful for preliminary testing of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at regeneration of the injured spinal cord in paraplegic patients.","Synaptic cotransmission is the ability of neurons to use more than one transmitter to convey synaptic signals. Cotransmission was originally described as the presence of a classic transmitter, which conveys main signal, along one or more cotransmitters that modulate transmission, later on, it was found cotransmission of classic transmitters. It has been generally accepted that neurons store and release the same set of transmitters in all their synaptic processes. However, some findings that show axon endings of individual neurons storing and releasing different sets of transmitters, are not in accordance with this assumption, and give support to the hypothesis that neurons can segregate transmitters to different synapses. Here, we review the studies showing segregation of transmitters in invertebrate and mammalian central nervous system neurons, and correlate them with our results obtained in sympathetic neurons. Our data show that these neurons segregate even classic transmitters to separated axons. Based on our data we suggest that segregation is a plastic phenomenon and responds to functional synaptic requirements, and to 'environmental' cues such as neurotrophins. We propose that neurons have the machinery to guide the different molecules required in synaptic transmission through axons and sort them to different axon endings. We believe that transmitter segregation improves neuron interactions during cotransmission and gives them selective and better control of synaptic plasticity.","Interactions among REM-ON and REM-OFF neurons form the basic scaffold for rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) regulation; however, precise mechanism of their activation and cessation, respectively, was unclear. Locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenalin (NA)-ergic neurons are REM-OFF type and receive GABA-ergic inputs among others. GABA acts postsynaptically on the NA-ergic REM-OFF neurons in the LC and presynaptically on the latter's projection terminals and modulates NA-release on the REM-ON neurons. Normally during wakefulness and non-REMS continuous release of NA from the REM-OFF neurons, which however, is reduced during the latter phase, inhibits the REM-ON neurons and prevents REMS. At this stage GABA from substantia nigra pars reticulate acting presynaptically on NA-ergic terminals on REM-ON neurons withdraws NA-release causing the REM-ON neurons to escape inhibition and being active, may be even momentarily. A working-model showing neurochemical-map explaining activation of inactivation process, showing contribution of GABA-ergic presynaptic inhibition in withdrawing NA-release and dis-inhibition induced activation of REM-ON neurons, which in turn activates other GABA-ergic neurons and shutting-off REM-OFF neurons for the initiation of REMS-generation has been explained. Our model satisfactorily explains yet unexplained puzzles (i) why normally REMS does not appear during waking, rather, appears following non-REMS; (ii) why cessation of LC-NA-ergic-REM-OFF neurons is essential for REMS-generation; (iii) factor(s) which does not allow cessation of REM-OFF neurons causes REMS-loss; (iv) the association of changes in levels of GABA and NA in the brain during REMS and its deprivation and associated symptoms; v) why often dreams are associated with REMS.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.04.006 PMID: 22579262  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Post-translational modification of proteins by the lipid palmitate is critical for protein localization and function. Palmitoylation is regulated by the opposing enzymes palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and acyl protein thioesterases, which add and remove palmitate from proteins, respectively. Palmitoylation is particularly important for a number of processes including neuronal development and synaptic activity in the central nervous system. Dysregulated palmitoylation contributes to neuropsychiatric disease. In total six PATs (HIP14, HIP14L, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC9, ZDHHC12, and ZDHHC15) and one thioesterase (PPT1) have been implicated in Huntington disease (HD), Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and infantile and adult onset forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Currently there is no genetic link between PATs and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis but palmitoylation of amyloid precursor protein-processing enzyme, γ-secretase, influences β-amyloid generation. Several lines of evidence point to a role for palmitoylation by HIP14 in the pathogenesis of HD; HIP14 is dysfunctional in the presence of the HD mutation and Hip14-deficient mice develop features of HD. Wildtype huntingtin (the protein mutated in HD) enhances the PAT activity of HIP14 and mutant HTT interacts less with HIP14. Therefore, it may be that loss of the positive modulation of HIP14 activity due to reduced interaction with huntingtin is important in the disease mechanism. Preliminary evidence suggests a closely related PAT to HIP14, HIP14L, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of HD. In order to design rational therapeutic approaches to restore palmitoylation in neuropsychiatric disease, it will be critical to better understand the relationships between PATs and thioesterases with their regulators and substrates.","Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is the most common inherited spinocerebellar ataxia and one of many polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases. In MJD, a CAG repeat expansion encodes an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein, ATXN3. Here we review MJD, focusing primarily on the function and dysfunction of ATXN3 and on advances toward potential therapies. ATXN3 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) whose highly specialized properties suggest that it participates in ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. By virtue of its interactions with VCP, various ubiquitin ligases and other ubiquitin-linked proteins, ATXN3 may help regulate the stability or activity of many proteins in diverse cellular pathways implicated in proteotoxic stress response, aging, and cell differentiation. Expansion of the polyQ tract in ATXN3 is thought to promote an altered conformation in the protein, leading to changes in interactions with native partners and to the formation of insoluble aggregates. The development of a wide range of cellular and animal models of MJD has been crucial to the emerging understanding of ATXN3 dysfunction upon polyQ expansion. Despite many advances, however, the principal molecular mechanisms by which mutant ATXN3 elicits neurotoxicity remain elusive. In a chronic degenerative disease like MJD, it is conceivable that mutant ATXN3 triggers multiple, interconnected pathogenic cascades that precipitate cellular dysfunction and eventual cell death. A better understanding of these complex molecular mechanisms will be important as scientists and clinicians begin to focus on developing effective therapies for this incurable, fatal disorder.","The engineered antibody approach to Huntington's disease (HD) therapeutics is based on the premise that significantly lowering the levels of the primary misfolded mutant protein will reduce abnormal protein interactions and direct toxic effects of the misfolded huntingtin (HTT). This will in turn reduce the pathologic stress on cells, and normalize intrinsic proteostasis. Intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) are single-chain (scFv) and single-domain (dAb; nanobody) variable fragments that can retain the affinity and specificity of full-length antibodies, but can be selected and engineered as genes. Functionally, they represent a protein-based approach to the problem of aberrant mutant protein folding, post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and aggregation. Several intrabodies that bind on either side of the expanded polyglutamine tract of mutant HTT have been reported to improve the mutant phenotype in cell and organotypic cultures, fruit flies, and mice. Further refinements to the difficult challenges of intraneuronal delivery, cytoplasmic folding, and long-term efficacy are in progress. This review covers published studies and emerging approaches on the choice of targets, selection and engineering methods, gene and protein delivery options, and testing of candidates in cell and animal models. The resultant antibody fragments can be used as direct therapeutics and as target validation/drug discovery tools for HD, while the technology is also applicable to a wide range of neurodegenerative and other diseases that are triggered by toxic proteins.","Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet despite this, very little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. Initially it was thought to be a disease primarily involving loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recent studies, however, have focused on observations that aggregated α-synuclein protein, the major component of Lewy bodies, is found throughout the nervous system. It is speculated that misfolded α-synuclein transfers between cells in a prion-like manner, thereby mediating the spread of the neuropathology. In this review, we discuss the staging (according to Braak) of Parkinson pathology and the concept describing the disease progression from one region of the brain to the other. We highlight how α-synuclein might be responsible for the spread of the disease. We compare the idea of a prion-like mechanism contributing to Parkinson's disease to emerging concepts that other proteins participate in similar processes in other neurodegenerative diseases. We then examine the future implications of a critical role in disease pathogenesis of α-synuclein for the classification, diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease in the future.","Neurons are specialized cells with unique features, including a constant high demand for energy. Mitochondria satisfy this constant demand, and are emerging as a central target for dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease. PPARγ co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcription co-activator for nuclear receptors such as the PPARs, and thereby coordinates a number of gene expression programs to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Studies of PGC-1α knock-out mice have yielded important insights into the role of PGC-1α in normal nervous system function and potentially neurological disease. HD is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein, and decades of work have established mitochondrial dysfunction as a key feature of HD pathogenesis. However, after the discovery of the HD gene, numerous reports produced strong evidence for altered transcription in HD. In 2006, a series of studies revealed that PGC-1α transcription interference contributes to HD neurodegeneration, linking the nuclear transcriptionopathy with the mitochondrial dysfunction. Subsequent work has strengthened this view, and further extended the role of PGC-1α within the CNS. Within the last year, studies of Parkinson's disease, another involuntary movement disorder long associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, have shown that PGC-1α dysregulation is contributing to its pathogenesis. As PGC-1α is likely also important for aging, a process with considerable relevance to neuron function, translational studies aimed at developing therapies based upon the PGC-1α pathway as a high priority target are underway.","The expression, processing, transport and activities of both coding and non-coding RNAs play critical roles in normal neuronal function and differentiation. Over the past decade, these same pathways have come under scrutiny as potential contributors to neurodegenerative disease. Here we focus broadly on the roles of RNA and RNA processing in neurodegeneration. We first discuss a set of ""RNAopathies"", where non-coding repeat expansions drive pathogenesis through a surprisingly diverse set of mechanisms. We next explore an emerging class of ""RNA binding proteinopathies"" where redistribution and aggregation of the RNA binding proteins TDP-43 or FUS contribute to a potentially broad range of neurodegenerative disorders. Lastly, we delve into the potential contributions of alterations in both short and long non-coding RNAs to neurodegenerative illness.","Polyglutamine diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the coding regions of specific genes. One of the most important features of polyglutamine diseases is that, despite the widespread and in some cases ubiquitous expression of the polyglutamine proteins, specific populations of neurons degenerate in each disease. This finding has led to the idea that polyglutamine diseases are cell-autonomous diseases, in which selective neuronal dysfunction and death result from damage caused by the mutant protein within the targeted neuronal population itself. Development of animal models for conditional expression of polyglutamine proteins, along with new pharmacologic manipulation of polyglutamine protein expression and toxicity, has led to a remarkable change of the current view of polyglutamine diseases as cell-autonomous disorders. It is becoming evident that toxicity in the neighboring non-neuronal cells contributes to selective neuronal damage. This observation implies non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration in polyglutamine diseases. Here, we describe cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of polyglutamine disease pathogenesis, including toxicity in neurons, skeletal muscle, glia, germinal cells, and other cell types.","The recycling endosome (RE) is an organelle in the endocytic pathway where plasma membranes (proteins and lipids) internalized by endocytosis are processed back to the cell surface for reuse. Endocytic recycling is the primary way for the cell to maintain constituents of the plasma membrane (Griffiths et al., 1989), i.e., to maintain the abundance of receptors and transporters on cell surfaces. Membrane traffic through the RE is crucial for several key cellular processes including cytokinesis and cell migration. In polarized cells, including neurons, the RE is vital for the generation and maintenance of the polarity of the plasma membrane. Many RE dependent cargo molecules are known to be important for neuronal function and there is evidence that improper function of key proteins in RE-associated pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease. The function of the RE in neurons is poorly understood. Therefore, there is need to understand how membrane dynamics in RE-associated pathways are affected or participate in the development or progression of neurological diseases. This review summarizes advances in understanding endocytic recycling associated with the RE, challenges in elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying RE function, and evidence for RE dysfunction in neurological disorders.","The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major intracellular proteolytic mechanism controlling the degradation of misfolded/abnormal proteins. A common hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in other neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of misfolded/abnormal proteins into the damaged neurons, leading to the formation of cellular inclusions that are mostly ubiquitin-positive. Although proteolysis is a complex mechanism requiring the participation of different pathways, the abundant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins strongly suggests an important contribution of UPS to these neuropathological features. The use of cellular and animal models of ALS, particularly those expressing mutant SOD1, the gene mutation most represented in familiar ALS, has provided significant evidence for a role of UPS in protein inclusions formation and motor neuron death. This review will specifically discuss this piece of evidence and provide suggestions of potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. We will also discuss the finding that, unlike the constitutive proteasome subunits, the inducible subunits are overexpressed early during disease progression in SOD1 mice models of ALS. These subunits form the immunoproteasome and generate peptides for the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, suggesting a role of this system in the immune responses associated with the pathological features of ALS. Since recent discoveries indicate that innate and adaptive immunity may influence the disease process, in this review we will also provide evidence of a possible connection between immune-inflammatory reactions and UPS function, in the attempt to better understand the etiopathology of ALS and to identify appropriate targets for novel treatment strategies of this devastating disease.","Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are neurodegenerative disorders that specifically affect the survival and function of upper and/or lower motor neurons. Since motor neurons are responsible for the control of voluntary muscular movement, MNDs are characterized by muscle spasticity, weakness and atrophy. Different susceptibility genes associated with an increased risk to develop MNDs have been reported and several mutated genes have been linked to hereditary forms of MNDs. However, most cases of MNDs occur in sporadic forms and very little is known on their causes. Interestingly, several molecular mechanisms seem to participate in the progression of both the inherited and sporadic forms of MNDs. These include cytoskeleton organization, mitochondrial functions, DNA repair and RNA synthesis/processing, vesicle trafficking, endolysosomal trafficking and fusion, as well as protein folding and protein degradation. In particular, accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins is a hallmark of MNDs, suggesting that the protein quality control system (molecular chaperones and the degradative systems: ubiquitin-proteasome-system and autophagy) are saturated or not sufficient to allow the clearance of these altered proteins. In this review we mainly focus on the MNDs associated with disturbances in protein folding and protein degradation and on the potential implication of a specific class of molecular chaperones, the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs/HSPBs), in motor neuron function and survival. How boosting of specific HSPBs may be a potential useful therapeutic approach in MNDs and how mutations in specific HSPBs can directly cause motor neuron degeneration is discussed.","In polyglutamine diseases, an abnormally elongated polyglutamine tract results in protein misfolding and accumulation of intracellular aggregates. The length of the polyglutamine expansion correlates with the tendency of the mutant protein to aggregate, as well as with neuronal toxicity and earlier disease onset. Although currently there is no effective cure to prevent or slow down the progression of these neurodegenerative disorders, increasing the clearance of mutant proteins has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy are the two main degradative pathways responsible for eliminating misfolded and unnecessary proteins in the cell. We will review some of the studies that have proposed autophagy as a strategy to reduce the accumulation of polyglutamine-expanded protein aggregates and protect against mutant protein neurotoxicity. We will also discuss some of the currently known mechanisms that induce autophagy, which may be beneficial for the treatment of these and other neurodegenerative disorders.","In the present article, we review the many facets of mitochondrial dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease due to loss of upper motor neurons in cerebral cortex and lower motor neurons in brainstem and spinal cord. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that the many, interconnected facets of mitochondrial dysfunction may play a more significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This notion stems from our expanding knowledge of the complex physiology of mitochondria and of alteration of their properties that might confer an intrinsic susceptibility to long-lived, post-mitotic motor neurons to energy deficit, calcium mishandling and oxidative stress. The wealth of evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a major event in the pathology of ALS has prompted new studies aimed to the development of new mitochondria-targeted therapies. However, it is now clear that drugs targeting more than one aspect of mitochondrial dysfunction are needed to fight this devastating disease.","Since the description by Alois Alzheimer, more than 50 years have passed during which senile dementia and pre-senile dementia have been considered Alzheimer disease (AD) on the basis of their common neuropathological and clinical manifestations. AD now covers pre-senile dementia, senile dementia, mild cognitive impairment and pre-clinical AD, all of them within the context of AD-related pathology. However, there is still a gray area between normal aging with AD-related pathology and AD. Here it is proposed that Alzheimer (or alzheimer) is an age-related neurodegenerative process distinguished from normal aging by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Alzheimer affects about 80% of individuals aged 65 years but dementia only occurs in a small percentage of individuals at this age; prevalence of dementia in Alzheimer increases to 25% in individuals aged 80 years. The concepts derived from the β-amyloid hypothesis support β-amyloid as a conductor in the pathogenesis of familial AD and as a prodding factor in sporadic AD. Moreover, seeding of β-amyloid and truncated tau explains incorporation, enhancement and perpetuation of AD-related changes. Therefore, the earliest Alzheimer changes confined to selected regions are the first grounds and the main risk factor for developing dementia. The term Alzheimer embraces this assumption and likens its meaning to other degenerative biological processes, such as atherosclerosis, that may eventually progress to disease. In this context, the first stages of Alzheimer should be considered as primary targets of therapeutic intervention in order to prevent progression to diseased states.","Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a medical emergency that accounts for 5% of all stroke cases. Individuals affected are typically in the prime of their lives (mean age 50 years). Approximately 12% of patients die before receiving medical attention, 33% within 48 h and 50% within 30 days of aSAH. Of the survivors 50% suffer from permanent disability with an estimated lifetime cost more than double that of an ischemic stroke. Traditionally, spasm that develops in large cerebral arteries 3-7 days after aneurysm rupture is considered the most important determinant of brain injury and outcome after aSAH. However, recent studies show that prevention of delayed vasospasm does not improve outcome in aSAH patients. This finding has finally brought in focus the influence of early brain injury on outcome of aSAH. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that brain injury begins at the aneurysm rupture, evolves with time and plays an important role in patients' outcome. In this manuscript we review early brain injury after aSAH. Due to the early nature, most of the information on this injury comes from animals and few only from autopsy of patients who died within days after aSAH. Consequently, we began with a review of animal models of early brain injury, next we review the mechanisms of brain injury according to the sequence of their temporal appearance and finally we discuss the failure of clinical translation of therapies successful in animal models of aSAH.","Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most typical characteristics in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (advanced stage). Although several mechanisms like neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses have been recognized to be involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in these diseases, recent studies on neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction have demonstrated a significant impact of receptor modulation on cognitive changes. The pathological alterations in various receptors appear to contribute to cognitive impairment and/or deterioration with correlation to diversified mechanisms. This article recapitulates the present understandings and concepts underlying the modulation of different receptors in human beings and various experimental models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as a conceptual update on the underlying mechanisms. Specific roles of serotonin, adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will be interactively discussed. Complex mechanisms involved in their signaling pathways in the cognitive dysfunction associated with the neurodegenerative diseases will also be addressed. Substantial evidence has suggested that those receptors are crucial neuroregulators contributing to cognitive pathology and complicated correlations exist between those receptors and the expression of cognitive capacities. The pathological alterations in the receptors would, therefore, contribute to cognitive impairments and/or deterioration in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Future research may shed light on new clues for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases by targeting specific alterations in these receptors and their signal transduction pathways in the frontal-striatal, fronto-striato-thalamic, and mesolimbic circuitries.","The basic pattern of rhythmic jaw movements produced during mastication is generated by a neuronal network located in the brainstem and referred to as the masticatory central pattern generator (CPG). This network composed of neurons mostly associated to the trigeminal system is found between the rostral borders of the trigeminal motor nucleus and facial nucleus. This review summarizes current knowledge on the anatomical organization, the development, the connectivity and the cellular properties of these trigeminal circuits in relation to mastication. Emphasis is put on a population of rhythmogenic neurons in the dorsal part of the trigeminal sensory nucleus. These neurons have intrinsic bursting capabilities, supported by a persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)), which are enhanced when the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) diminishes. Presented evidence suggest that the Ca(2+) dependency of this current combined with its voltage-dependency could provide a mechanism for cortical and sensory afferent inputs to the nucleus to interact with the rhythmogenic properties of its neurons to adjust and adapt the rhythmic output. Astrocytes are postulated to contribute to this process by modulating the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration and a model is proposed to explain how functional microdomains defined by the boundaries of astrocytic syncitia may form under the influence of incoming inputs.","Synaptic transmission is a finely regulated mechanism of neuronal communication. The release of neurotransmitter at the synapse is not only the reflection of membrane depolarization events, but rather, is the summation of interactions between ion channels, G protein coupled receptors, second messengers, and the exocytotic machinery itself which exposes the components within a synaptic vesicle to the synaptic cleft. The focus of this review is to explore the role of G protein signaling as it relates to neurotransmission, as well as to discuss the recently determined inhibitory mechanism of Gβγ dimers acting directly on the exocytotic machinery proteins to inhibit neurotransmitter release.","In the past four decades, the main focus of investigators in the field of spinal cord regeneration has been to devise therapeutic measures that enhance neural regeneration. More recently, emphasis has been placed on enhancing remyelination and providing oligodendrocyte-protection after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Demyelination post-SCI is part of the cascading secondary injury that takes place immediately after the primary insult; therefore, therapeutic measures are needed to reduce oligodendrocyte death and/or enhance remyelination during the acute stage, preserving neurological functions that would be lost otherwise. In this review a thorough investigation of the oligodendrocyte-protective and remyelinative molecular therapies available to date is provided. The advent of new biomaterials shown to promote remyelination post-SCI is discussed mainly in the context of a combinatorial approach where the biomaterial also provides drug delivery capabilities. The aim of these molecular and biomaterial-based therapies is twofold: (1) oligodendrocyte-protective therapy, which involves protecting already existing oligodendrocytes from undergoing apoptosis/necrosis; and (2) inductive remyelination, which involves harnessing the remyelinative capabilities of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at the lesion site by providing a suitable environment for their migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation. From the evidence reported in the literature, we conclude that the use of a combinatorial approach including biomaterials and molecular therapies would provide advantages such as: (1) sustained release of the therapeutic molecule, (2) local delivery at the lesion site, and (3) an environment at the site of injury that promotes OPC migration, differentiation and remyelination.","In humans, heterogeneity in the decline of hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is observed during aging. Rodents have been employed as models of age-related cognitive decline and the spatial water maze has been used to show variability in the emergence and extent of impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. Impairment in the consolidation of intermediate-term memory for rapidly acquired and flexible spatial information emerges early, in middle-age. As aging proceeds, deficits may broaden to include impaired incremental learning of a spatial reference memory. The extent and time course of impairment has been be linked to senescence of calcium (Ca²⁺) regulation and Ca²⁺-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms in region CA1. Specifically, aging is associated with altered function of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels (VDCCs), and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) linked to intracellular Ca²⁺ stores (ICS). In young animals, NMDAR activation induces long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (NMDAR-LTP), which is thought to mediate the rapid consolidation of intermediate-term memory. Oxidative stress, starting in middle-age, reduces NMDAR function. In addition, VDCCs and ICS can actively inhibit NMDAR-dependent LTP and oxidative stress enhances the role of VDCC and RyR-ICS in regulating synaptic plasticity. Blockade of L-type VDCCs promotes NMDAR-LTP and memory in older animals. Interestingly, pharmacological or genetic manipulations to reduce hippocampal NMDAR function readily impair memory consolidation or rapid learning, generally leaving incremental learning intact. Finally, evidence is mounting to indicate a role for VDCC-dependent synaptic plasticity in associative learning and the consolidation of remote memories. Thus, VDCC-dependent synaptic plasticity and extrahippocampal systems may contribute to incremental learning deficits observed with advanced aging.","Local translation of dendritic mRNAs is a key aspect of dendrite and spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity, two phenomena generally compromised in intellectual disability disorders. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase involved in a plethora of functions including dendritogenesis, plasticity and the regulation of local translation. Hence, this kinase may well be implicated in intellectual disability. Hyperactivation of mTOR has been recently reported in mouse models of Fragile X and tuberous sclerosis, two important causes of intellectual disability. Moreover, local dendritic translation seems to be increased in Fragile X syndrome. Recent findings show that the mTOR pathway is also deregulated in murine models of Rett's syndrome and Down's syndrome. As in Fragile X, local dendritic translation seems to be abnormally active in Down's syndrome mice, while rapamycin, a Food and Drug Administration-approved mTOR inhibitor, restores normal rates of translation. Rapamycin administration in tuberous sclerosis mice rescues deficits in behavior and synaptic plasticity. Indeed, mTOR-dependent deregulation of local translation may be a common trait in different intellectual deficiencies, suggesting that mTOR inhibitors may have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of diverse forms of cognitive impairment.","The habenula is a small bilateral structure in the posterior-medial aspect of the dorsal thalamus that has been implicated in a remarkably wide range of behaviors including olfaction, ingestion, mating, endocrine and reward function, pain and analgesia. Afferent connections from forebrain structures send inputs to the lateral and medial habenula where efferents are mainly projected to brainstem regions that include well-known pain modulatory regions such as the periaqueductal gray and raphe nuclei. A convergence of preclinical data implicates the region in multiple behaviors that may be considered part of the pain experience including a putative role in pain modulation, affective, and motivational processes. The habenula seems to play a role as an evaluator, acting as a major point of convergence where external stimuli is received, evaluated, and redirected for motivation of appropriate behavioral response. Here, we review the role of the habenula in pain and analgesia, consider its potential role in chronic pain, and review more recent clinical and functional imaging data of the habenula from animals and humans. Even through the habenula is a small brain structure, advances in structural and functional imaging in humans should allow for further advancement of our understanding of its role in pain and analgesia.","The crustacean swimmeret system includes a distributed set of local circuits that individually control movements of one jointed limb. These modular local circuits occur in pairs in each segmental ganglion, and normally operate synchronously to produce smoothly coordinated cycles of limb movements on different body segments. The system presents exceptional opportunities for computational and experimental investigation of neural mechanisms of coordination because: (a) The system will express in vitro the periodic motor pattern that normally drives cycles of swimmeret movements during forward swimming. (b) The intersegmental neurons which encode information that is necessary and sufficient for normal coordination have been identified, and their activity can be recorded. (c) The local commissural neurons that integrate this coordinating information and tune the phase of each swimmeret are known. (d) The complete set of synaptic connections between coordinating neurons and these commissural neurons have been described. (e). The synaptic connections onto each local pattern-generating circuit through which coordinating information tunes the circuit's phase have been discovered. These factors make possible for the first time a detailed, comprehensive cellular and synaptic explanation of how this neural circuit produces an effective, behaviorally significant output. This paper is the first comprehensive review of the system's neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, its local and intersegmental circuitry, its transmitter pharmacology, its neuromodulatory control mechanisms, and its interactions with other motor systems. Each of these topics is covered in detail in an attempt to provide a complete review of the literature as a foundation for new research. The series of hypotheses that have been proposed to account for the system's properties are reviewed critically in the context of experimental tests of their validity.","A shared hallmark for many neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of toxic protein species which is assumed to be the cause for these diseases. Since the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the most important pathway for selective protein degradation it is likely that it is involved in the aetiology neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, impairment of the UPS has been reported to occur during neurodegeneration. Although accumulation of toxic protein species (amyloid β) are in turn known to impair the UPS the relationship is not necessarily causal. We provide an overview of the most recent insights in the roles the UPS plays in protein degradation and other processes. Additionally, we discuss the role of the UPS in clearance of the toxic proteins known to accumulate in the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The present paper will focus on critically reviewing the involvement of the UPS in specific neurodegenerative diseases and will discuss if UPS impairment is a cause, a consequence or both of the disease.","There is a need for refinement of the current behavioral phenotyping methods for mouse models of genetic disorders. The current approach is to perform a behavioral screen using standardized tasks to define a broad phenotype of the model. This phenotype is then compared to what is known concerning the disorder being modeled. The weakness inherent in this approach is twofold: First, the tasks that make up these standard behavioral screens do not model specific behaviors associated with a given genetic mutation but rather phenotypes affected in various genetic disorders; secondly, these behavioral tasks are insufficiently sensitive to identify subtle phenotypes. An alternate phenotyping strategy is to determine the core behavioral phenotypes of the genetic disorder being studied and develop behavioral tasks to evaluate specific hypotheses concerning the behavioral consequences of the genetic mutation. This approach emphasizes direct comparisons between the mouse and human that facilitate the development of neurobehavioral biomarkers or quantitative outcome measures for studies of genetic disorders across species.","Knowledge of molecular mechanisms that underlie development of the enteric nervous system has greatly expanded in recent decades. Enteric neuropathies related to aberrant genetic development are thus becoming increasingly recognized. There has been no recent review of these often highly morbid disorders. This review highlights advances in knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders from a clinical perspective. It includes diseases characterized by an infantile aganglionic Hirschsprung phenotype and those in which structural abnormalities are less pronounced. The implications for diagnosis, screening and possible reparative approaches are presented.","The human red nucleus consists of the well-developed parvicellular red nucleus (pNr) and the rudimentary magnocellular red nucleus (mNr). It is believed that the human pNr is separated from the nucleus accessorius medialis of Bechterew (NB), which, generally speaking, is located in the ventral central gray. It was initially suggested that the ""rolled sheet"" model of the human pNr that we proposed included the view that the human NB does not occupy the ventral central gray but is placed in the dorsomedial part of the red nucleus. It is perhaps more appropriate to state that the NB, the origin of the medial tegmental tract (MTT), over time became displaced from the ventral central gray and was in part shifted to the adjacent reticular formation. The majority of the MTT tract however remained in its established location. Evolutionarily speaking, this separation of the NB and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch (ND), and the translocation of the position of the NB just referred to, might have begun within the lineage of the apes prior to the emergence of man. Furthermore it is generally believed that the human mNr consists of a scattered few groups of giant-to-large neurons situated among the fiber bundles of the superior cerebellar peduncle at the level of the oculomotor nerve fibers. It has long been considered impossible to clearly draw an outline of the human mNr such that it could be seen as a self-contained structural entity. However, we now demonstrate just such an outline of the rudimentary human adult mNr through employment of the concepts of the so-called ""Mannen's closed nucleus"" and ""Ogawa's human mNr"": descriptions that exclude the associated area that contains neurons which possess melanin pigment. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that the human fetus and newborns have a well-developed semilunar mNr, and this observation raises the possibility that the associated transient but well-developed rubrospinal tract seen in the perinatal state might have had an important role for the development of upright bipedalism in hominids. The well-developed human prefrontal-NB-olivo-lateral cerebellar circuit might possibly have resulted in the emergence of language.","The p62/sequestosome-1 is a multifunctional protein containing several protein-protein interaction domains. Through these interactions p62 is involved in the regulation of cellular signaling and protein trafficking, aggregation and degradation. p62 protein can bind through its UBA motif to ubiquitinated proteins and control their aggregation and degradation via either autophagy or proteasomes. p62 protein has been reported to be seen in association with the intracellular inclusions in primary and secondary tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies and other neurodegenerative brain disorders displaying inclusions with misfolded proteins. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), p62 protein is associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and ubiquitin. Increasing evidence indicates that p62 has an important role in the degradation of tau protein. The lack of p62 protein expression provokes the tau pathology in mice. Recent studies have demonstrated that the p62 gene expression and cytoplasmic p62 protein levels are significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of AD patients. Decline in the level of p62 protein can disturb the signaling pathways of Nrf2, cyclic AMP and NF-κB and in that way increase oxidative stress and impair neuronal survival. We will review here the molecular and functional characteristics of p62 protein and outline its potential role in the regulation of Alzheimer's pathogenesis.","The current review outlines the under-appreciated effects of physical exercise on the course of psychiatric disorders, focussing on recent findings from animal and human research. Several studies have shown that regular physical exercise is significantly beneficial for psychiatric patients both on a biological and a psychological level. Positive effects of controlled exercise include improved metabolic responses, neuro-protection, increased quality of life, and reduced psychopathological symptoms. Studies investigating the effectiveness of various physical training interventions in alleviating severe mental diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) or major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that physical exercise can relieve symptoms of depression, psychosis and dementia and more importantly can curtail further progression of these diseases. This review assesses the most effective methods of physical training for specific psychiatric symptoms. Introducing physical exercise in therapeutic regimes would be an innovative approach that could significantly reduce the severity of psychopathological and cognitive symptoms in patients. The positive biological and molecular outcomes associated with physical exercise render it a concrete therapeutic strategy for improving the quality of live and reducing physical illness in psychiatric patients. Therefore, integrating physical activity into a patient's social life may be an effective treatment strategy. Furthermore, exercise might have the potential to be a preventative treatment within the context of multi-modal therapeutic programs.","There are well-known sex differences in the epidemiology and etiopathology of alcohol dependence. Male gender is a crucial risk factor for the onset of alcohol addiction. A directly modifying role of testosterone in alcohol addiction-related behavior is well established. Sex hormones exert both permanent (organizational) and transient (activational) effects on the human brain. The sensitive period for these effects lasts throughout life. In this article, we present a novel early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction. We propose that early exposure to sex hormones triggers structural (organizational) neuroadaptations. These neuroadaptations affect cellular and behavioral responses to adult sex hormones, sensitize the brain's reward system to the reinforcing properties of alcohol and modulate alcohol addictive behavior later in life. This review outlines clinical findings related to the early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction (handedness, the second-to-fourth-finger length ratio, and the androgen receptor and aromatase) and includes clinical and preclinical literature regarding the activational effects of sex hormones in alcohol drinking behavior. Furthermore, we discuss the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and -gonadal axes and the opioid system in mediating the relationship between sex hormone activity and alcohol dependence. We conclude that a combination of exposure to sex hormones in utero and during early development contributes to the risk of alcohol addiction later in life. The early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction may prove to be a valuable tool in the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Dyskinesias represent a major complication of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have prompted a search for alternative treatments. The most radical advances in this field have been provided by surgical manipulations of the deep basal ganglia nuclei, and particularly by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Although being very effective, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN is a poorly understood treatment. Besides its anti-akinetic activity, it can be pro-dyskinetic above a certain stimulation intensity. Accumulating evidence indicates that dyskinesias induced by STN-HFS and dopamine replacement therapy are linked to dysregulation of glutamate transmission in the basal ganglia. In rat models of PD, both types of dyskinesia are associated with increased concentrations of extracellular glutamate and altered expression of glutamate transporters in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the striatum. Furthermore, a vast and ever growing literature has revealed changes in the expression, phosphorylation state, and/or subcellular distribution of specific subtypes of glutamate receptors in these dyskinetic conditions. Both types of dyskinesias are linked to an increased phosphorylation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in critical basal ganglia circuits. We conclude that disruption of glutamate homeostasis and activation of perisynaptic and extra-synaptic glutamate receptors are an important pathophysiological component of these treatment-induced dyskinesias in PD. These findings lay the ground for therapeutic development initiatives targeting dysfunctional components of glutamate transmission in the basal ganglia.","This paper provides the first review of the memory-enhancing and neuroprotective metabolic mechanisms of action of methylene blue in vivo. These mechanisms have important implications as a new neurobiological approach to improve normal memory and to treat memory impairment and neurodegeneration associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Methylene blue's action is unique because its neurobiological effects are not determined by regular drug-receptor interactions or drug-response paradigms. Methylene blue shows a hormetic dose-response, with opposite effects at low and high doses. At low doses, methylene blue is an electron cycler in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, with unparalleled antioxidant and cell respiration-enhancing properties that affect the function of the nervous system in a versatile manner. A major role of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase on the memory-enhancing effects of methylene blue is supported by available data. The memory-enhancing effects have been associated with improvement of memory consolidation in a network-specific and use-dependent fashion. In addition, low doses of methylene blue have also been used for neuroprotection against mitochondrial dysfunction in humans and experimental models of disease. The unique auto-oxidizing property of methylene blue and its pleiotropic effects on a number of tissue oxidases explain its potent neuroprotective effects at low doses. The evidence reviewed supports a mechanistic role of low-dose methylene blue as a promising and safe intervention for improving memory and for the treatment of acute and chronic conditions characterized by increased oxidative stress, neurodegeneration and memory impairment.","Ca(2+) currents in neurons and muscle cells have been classified as being one of 5 types, of which four, L, N, P/Q and R were said to be high threshold and one, T, was designated low threshold. This review focuses on quantitative aspects of L-type currents. L-type channels are now distinguished according to their structure as one of four main subtypes Ca(v)1.1-Ca(v)1.4. L-type calcium currents play many fundamental roles in cellular dynamical processes including control of firing rate and pacemaking in neurons and cardiac cells, the activation of transcription factors involved in synaptic plasticity and in immune cells. The half-activation potentials of L-type currents (I(CaL)) have been ascribed values as low as -50mV and as high as near 0mV. The inactivation of I(CaL) has been found to be both voltage (VDI) and calcium-dependent (CDI) and the latter component may involve calcium-induced calcium release. CDI is often an important aspect of dynamical models of cell electrophysiology. We describe the basic components in modeling I(CaL) including activation and both voltage and calcium dependent inactivation and the two main approaches to determining the current. We review, by means of tables of values from over 65 representative studies, the various details of the dynamical properties associated with I(CaL) that have been found experimentally or employed in the last 25 years in deterministic modeling in various nervous system and cardiac cells. Distributions and statistics of several parameters related to activation and inactivation are obtained. There are few reliable complete experimental data on L-type calcium current kinetics for cells at physiological calcium ion concentrations. Neurons are divided approximately into two groups with experimental half-activation potentials that are high, ≈ -18.3mV, or low, ≈ -36.4mV, which correspond closely with those for Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channels in physiological solutions. There are very few complete experimental data on time constants of activation, those available suggesting values around 0.5-2ms. In modeling, a wide range of time constants has been employed. A major problem for quantitative studies due to lack of experimental data has been the use of kinetic parameters from one cell type for others. Inactivation time constants for VDI have been found experimentally with average 65ms. Examples of calculations of I(CaL) are made for linear and constant field methods and the effects of CDI are illustrated for single and double pulse protocols and the results compared with experiment. The review ends with a discussion and analysis of experimental subtype (Ca(v)1.1-Ca(v)1.4) properties and their roles in normal, including pacemaker, activity, and many pathological states.","The ability to make adaptive decisions during goal-directed navigation is a fundamental and highly evolved behavior that requires continual coordination of perceptions, learning and memory processes, and the planning of behaviors. Here, a neurobiological account for such coordination is provided by integrating current literatures on spatial context analysis and decision-making. This integration includes discussions of our current understanding of the role of the hippocampal system in experience-dependent navigation, how hippocampal information comes to impact midbrain and striatal decision making systems, and finally the role of the striatum in the implementation of behaviors based on recent decisions. These discussions extend across cellular to neural systems levels of analysis. Not only are key findings described, but also fundamental organizing principles within and across neural systems, as well as between neural systems functions and behavior, are emphasized. It is suggested that studying decision making during goal-directed navigation is a powerful model for studying interactive brain systems and their mediation of complex behaviors.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fast growing world-wide epidemic. AD is a genetically complex, slowly progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease of the brain. During decades of asymptomatic progression multiple interactive systems, pathways and molecular mechanisms (e.g. protein processing, aberrant signaling, inflammation and immune system, lipid transport, endocytosis, apoptosis, oxidative damage and response to stress, tau pathology, neuron and synapse loss, energy metabolism), contribute to the development of the early clinical prodromal stage with episodic memory deficits and to further decline and loss of general cognitive functioning during the final syndromal dementia stage. The non-mendelian genetically complex ""sporadic"" AD type is the most common form of dementia affecting people usually over the age of 65. Despite considerable progress of AD research in recent years and evolving paradigm shifts in both pathophysiological concepts as well as in diagnostic criteria fundamental challenges have not yet been resolved. The strong age-related incidence, the recent failure and complete lack of disease-modifying or preventive therapy that may delay onset or substantially affect the pathophysiology of AD, result in an enormous burden posed both on individuals, their families and care givers, and the societies at large, and these call for urgent concerted worldwide measures. Based on the meeting of the German Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease (GTF-AD) in Paris on July 19th 2011, the present position paper provides an overview on the current state and future developments in epidemiology, pathophysiology, disease conceptualization, diagnostic criteria and their use in research and clinical practice, as well as preventive and symptomatic therapeutic approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on a discussion of the different approaches to diagnostics and therapy taken by preventive/public health medicine, methodologically advanced academic research propagating the use of sophisticated biomarkers, and everyday clinical practice focusing on patient-centered care. During the next 10 years, major advances both in early detection as well as in therapy and comprehensive AD care seem mandatory. These still unmet needs call for ever more concerted and focused efforts in research across the world to combat the erupting and as yet uncontrolled epidemic of AD.","A major issue in current Alzheimer research presents in a growing dysbalance between a swiftly advancing biological marker and diagnostic research field (including advances in genetic research towards genetic profiling), key aspects of which have already found their way into newly proposed diagnostic criteria and international clinical dementia guidelines, and still rather limited and stagnating therapeutic and preventive options for physicians and patients worldwide. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) to date can be diagnosed with high accuracy years ahead of the late stage clinical syndromal dementia manifestation supported by biomarker guided detection of AD-characteristic pathophysiological features, there are currently no approved preventive or disease-modifying therapies available and the existing approved symptomatic therapy options provide only modest effect sizes in already demented patients without affecting the overall course and progression of the chronically progressive and complex brain disease. This unsatisfactory situation brings along a number of important ethical issues that need to be addressed. We outline some of the relevant ethical implications mainly related to the patient's best interest as well as to the patient's autonomy in the specific context of medical, psychological and social consequences of predicting AD using multi-modal biological markers. Consent, disclosure, or failure to disclose, information from genetic and predictive biomarker results raises significant ethical concerns among IRBs, regulators and advocacy groups. With the swift advances in ever earlier detection, diagnosis and classification in AD, a worldwide debate on ethical issues and consensus processes to reach a common ethical framework is warranted to safely and responsibly bring the best possible diagnostic measures as early as possible to patients and to the health care system.","Research on biomarkers and genetics shares a number of objectives, including the identification of novel disease mechanisms, optimization of therapeutic studies, and improvement of diagnosis and prognosis. The latter is of particular relevance in neurodegenerative diseases where the underlying molecular processes often go on for decades until the first clinical symptoms appear. In this commentary we review the potential contribution that insight gained from genetic research may have on biomarker development in neurodegeneration. We argue that future progress will largely depend on a widespread application of novel high-throughput technologies now becoming available in both fields.","Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive and disabling neurodegenerative disorders, in which signs and symptoms overlap with each other and with other neurodegenerative conditions. Currently, diagnosis, measurement of progression, and response to therapeutic intervention rely upon clinical observation. However, there remains a critical need for validated biomarkers in each of these areas. A definitive diagnostic test would improve clinical management and enrollment into clinical trials. An objective measure of progression is vitally important in identifying neuroprotective interventions. Biomarkers may also provide insight into pathogenesis, and might therefore suggest possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. In addition, certain biomarkers might be of use in monitoring the biochemical and physiological effects of therapeutic interventions. Development of diagnostic biomarkers has focused until recently upon imaging techniques based upon measuring loss of dopamine neurons. Additionally, advances in understanding the genetic contribution to neurodegenerative disorders, in particular in PD, have identified multiple causative genes and risk factors that in some cases may help estimate PD risk. However, recent availability of increasingly sophisticated bioinformatics technology has rendered development of fluid biomarkers feasible, opening the possibility of generally accessible blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests that could impact upon diagnosis, management, and research in PD, PDD, and DLB.","Biomarkers might play comprehensive roles in drug development for neurodegenerative diseases and particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Biomarkers can already be used to better define homogeneous study populations (e.g. enriched population at risk for AD) and to select the most promising drug candidates in their effective dosages for phase III clinical trials, so some biomarkers are currently in the process of implementation as primary, co-primary or secondary outcome variables into regulatory guideline documents, e.g. regarding phase II in drug development programs as outcome measures in proof of concept or dose finding studies. There are specific biomarkers available depending on the hypothesized mechanism of action of a medicinal product, e.g. impact on the amyloidogenic cascade or on tau-hyperphosphorylation. However, further validation of specific biomarkers in large-scale international controlled multicenter studies is necessary before they can be accepted as primary outcome measures in pivotal phase III clinical trials. There is an even stronger need for rigorous co-development of biological trait- and state marker candidates to provide evidence that a medicinal product affects the underlying disease process, which, together with clinical improvement, will be a precondition for a label of disease modification. Until now no biomarker has been sufficiently validated to be acceptable as a surrogate endpoint. Establishing of surrogate endpoints is an important goal in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in their early (preclinical, presymptomatic) stages, as traditional clinical outcome measures might be too insensitive to change or need unfeasible treatment durations for clinical trial conditions. Improvements can only be accomplished by active synergistic collaboration between academic, industrial and regulatory partners.", ,"Despite enormous financial and scientific efforts, still no approved disease-modifying therapies exist for Alzheimer's disease (AD). During the last decade all Phase III clinical trials on disease modifiers in AD have failed. The dementia stage of AD being probably too late in order to allow for successful disease modification has been identified as a possible culprit that could explain the failure of so many clinical trials. In parallel, a major development in the diagnostic research field of AD was achieved by the recent proposal of new diagnostic criteria for AD, which also specifically incorporate the use of biomarkers as defining criteria for preclinical stages of AD, thus extending the traditional definition of disease to very early stages that may be a more feasible target for various disease modifying therapeutic interventions. This ongoing paradigm shift in AD definition and diagnosis represents a fundamental basis for redefinition of interventional trials in AD, allowing to specifically focus on preventative measures during very early pathophysiologically confirmed stages of disease. This consensus paper reflects the outcome from a European Union and North American Task Force meeting comprised of experts from academia, industry, private foundations, and regulatory agencies that was convened in Toulouse, France on November 5, 2010 and that focused on prevention trials in AD. This position paper thoroughly analyzes prerequisites for successful preventative trials in AD and concludes with concrete recommendations on biomarkers, statistical tools and other variables important for improved study designs suitable for preventative as well as for early therapeutic interventional trials in AD.","Pathological 43-kDa transactive response sequence DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) has been recognized as the major disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive, tau and α-synuclein negative inclusions (FTLD-U) and the transitional forms between these multisystem conditions. In order to develop TDP-43 into a successful ALS biomarker, the natural history of TDP-43 pathology needs to be characterized and the underlying pathophysiology established. Here we propose a spatial and temporal ""two-axes"" model of central nervous system vulnerability for TDP-43 linked degeneration and review recent studies on potential biomarkers related to pathological TDP-43 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and skeletal muscle. The model includes the following two arms: Firstly, a ""motor neuron disease"" or ""spinal cord/brainstem to motor cortex"" axis (with degeneration possibly ascending from the lower motor neurons to the upper motor neurons); and secondly, a ""dementia"" or ""corticoid/allocortex to neocortex"" axis (with a probable spread of TDP-43 linked degeneration from the mediotemporal lobe to wider mesocortical and neocortical brain areas). At the cellular level, there is a gradual disappearance of normal TDP-43 in the nucleus in combination with the formation of pathological aggregates in the cell body and cellular processes, which can also be used to identify the stage of the disease process. Moreover, TDP-43 lesions in subpial/subependymal or perivascular localizations have been noted, and this might account for increased CSF and blood TDP-43 levels through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with intracellular Lewy inclusion bodies. The result is poverty of movement, increased muscle rigidity, and tremor at rest and on posture. Midbrain/nigral structural abnormalities can be demonstrated in vivo with both transcranial sonography (TCS) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) while positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligands exist to demonstrate dopamine terminal dysfunction. These radiotracers are markers of dopamine storage capacity, vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporter availability. While loss of putamen dopaminergic function leads to motor disability, Lewy bodies not only target dopamine neurons but have also been observed in serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. As a consequence, non-dopaminergic neurotransmission is also impaired resulting in non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction. PET and SPECT ligands exist to interrogate the function of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Cortical and limbic Lewy body disease is seen in more advanced PD and this can be detected with FDG PET as abnormal covariance between levels of resting brain metabolism in these regions. Additionally, widespread microglial activation can be detected in PD with PET. This review discusses the role of structural and functional imaging for understanding parkinsonian syndromes and aiding in their diagnosis and management.","Major depressive disorders (MDD) are among the most debilitating diseases worldwide and occur with a high prevalence in elderly individuals. Neurodegenerative diseases (in particular Alzheimer's disease, AD) do also show a strong age-dependent increase in incidence and prevalence among the elderly population. A high number of geriatric patients with MDD show cognitive deficits and a very high proportion of AD patients present co-morbid MDD, which poses difficult diagnostic and prognostic questions. Especially in prodromal and in very early stages of AD, it is almost impossible to differentiate between pure MDD and MDD with underlying AD. Here, we give a comprehensive review of the literature on the current state of candidate biomarkers for MDD (""positive MDD markers"") and briefly refer to established and validated diagnostic AD biomarkers in order to rule out underlying AD pathophysiology in elderly MDD subjects with cognitive impairments (""negative MDD biomarkers""). In summary, to date there is no evidence for positive diagnostic MDD biomarkers and the only way to delineate MDD from AD is to use ""negative MDD"" biomarkers. Because of this highly unsatisfactory current state of MDD biomarker research, we propose a research strategy targeting to detect and validate positive MDD biomarkers, which is based on a complex (genetic, molecular and neurophysiological) biological model that incorporates current state of the art knowledge on the pathobiology of MDD. This model delineates common pathways and the intersection between AD and MDD. Applying these concepts to MDD gives hope that positive MDD biomarkers can be successfully identified in the near future.", ,DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.07.007 PMID: 21801804  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Brain regions and their highly neuroplastic long axonal connections that expanded rapidly during hominid evolution are preferentially affected by Alzheimer disease. There is no natural animal model with full disease pathology (neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic amyloid plaques of a severity seen in Alzheimer's disease brains). Biomarkers such as reduced glucose metabolism in association neocortex, defects in long white matter tracts, RNA neurochemical changes, and high CSF levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein, which are helpful to identify MCI and preclinical Alzheimer disease patients, may also provide insights into what brain changes led to this disease being introduced during hominid evolution.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.07.008 PMID: 21801802  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"This commentary provides a brief introduction to the various uses that functional neuroimaging biomarkers can play in detecting, diagnosing, assessing treatment response and investigating neurodegenerative disorders. It then goes on to explain why the emphasis of much recent work has shifted to network-based biomarkers, as opposed to those that examine individual brain regions. A number of examples are referenced that illustrate the points made.","The objective of this review is to evaluate recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research in Alzheimer's disease for the development of therapeutic agents. The basic building block underpinning cognition is a brain network. The measured brain activity serves as an integrator of the various components, from genes to structural integrity, that impact the function of networks underpinning cognition. Specific networks can be interrogated using cognitive paradigms such as a learning task or a working memory task. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of neural networks allow one to investigate the function of a brain network by investigating the inherent coherency of the brain networks that can be measured during resting state. The coherent resting state networks allow testing in cognitively impaired patients that may not be possible with the use of cognitive paradigms. In particular the default mode network (DMN) includes the medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate, two key regions that support episodic memory function and are impaired in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By investigating the effects of a prospective drug compound on this network, it could illuminate the specificity of the compound with a network supporting memory function. This could provide valuable information on the methods of action at physiological and behaviourally relevant levels. Utilizing fMRI opens up new areas of research and a new approach for drug development, as it is an integrative tool to investigate entire networks within the brain. The network based approach provides a new independent method from previous ones to translate preclinical knowledge into the clinical domain.","During the last two decades, imaging of neural activation has become an invaluable tool for assessing the functional organization of the human brain in vivo. Due to its widespread application in neuroscience, functional neuroimaging has raised the interest of clinical researchers in its possible use as a diagnostic biomarker. A hallmark feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is their chronic non-linear dynamic and highly complex preclinical course. Neurodegenerative diseases unfold over years to decades through clinically silent and asymptomatic stages of early adaptive, compensatory to pathophysiological (i.e. actively neurodegenerative) and decompensatory mechanisms in the brain - phases that are increasingly being considered as critical for primary and secondary preventive and therapeutic measures. Emerging evidence supports the concept of a potentially fully reversible functional phase that may precede the onset of micro- and macrostructural and cognitive decline, a potentially late-stage ""neurodegenerative"" phase of a primary neurodegenerative disorder. Alzheimer's disease serves as an ideal model to test this hypothesis supported by the neural network model of the healthy and diseased brain. Being highly dynamic in nature, brain activation and neuronal network functional connectivity represent not only candidate diagnostic but also candidate surrogate markers for interventional trials. Potential caveats of functional imaging are critically reviewed with focus on confound variables such as altered neurovascular coupling as well as parameters related to task- and study design.","Rapid developments in medical neuroimaging have made it possible to reconstruct the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it spreads through the living brain. The current review focuses on the progressive signature of brain changes throughout the different stages of AD. We integrate recent findings on changes in cortical gray matter volume, white matter fiber tracts, neuropathological alterations, and brain metabolism assessed with molecular positron emission tomography (PET). Neurofibrillary tangles accumulate first in transentorhinal and cholinergic brain areas, and 4-D maps of cortical volume changes show early progressive temporo-parietal cortical thinning. Findings from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment fiber tract integrity show cortical disconnection in corresponding brain networks. Importantly, the developmental trajectory of brain changes is not uniform and may be modulated by several factors such as onset of disease mechanisms, risk-associated and protective genes, converging comorbidity, and individual brain reserve. There is a general agreement between in vivo brain maps of cortical atrophy and amyloid pathology assessed through PET, reminiscent of post mortem histopathology studies that paved the way in the staging of AD. The association between in vivo and post mortem findings will clarify the temporal dynamics of pathophysiological alterations in the development of preclinical AD. This will be important in designing effective treatments that target specific underlying disease AD mechanisms.","Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling forms of mental illness. One of the most important challenges is to establish biological markers which can accurately identify at-risk individuals in preclinical stages and thus improve the effects of early intervention strategies. Here, we review recent findings in the field of molecular genetics, CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) based markers as well as structural and functional neuroimaging in the light of their relevance for schizophrenia biomarker research. We also examine evidence supporting the hypothesis that schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease may share certain pathophysiological features, e.g. chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, and discuss their possible role in schizophrenia. The heterogeneous, multifaceted and multifactorial nature of the traditionally clinically operationalized entity ""schizophrenia"" presents an enormous challenge towards the identification of single diagnostic or surrogate markers. We propose that abnormal neural coordination is a major point of convergence of a number of crucial pathophysiological pathways. Therefore, functional markers reflecting disturbed neural coordination might be particularly attractive biomarker candidates, because of their ability to integrate the influence of diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, combinatorial and multimodal approaches may be a promising way to more accurately capture the complex biological underpinnings schizophrenia. We consider the development of such integrative biomarkers to be essential in order to facilitate a timely diagnosis of schizophrenia. They should also advance our understanding of the subtle and intricate biological nature of schizophrenia.","There are important recent developments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) translational research, especially with respect to the imaging of amyloid pathology in vivo using MRI and PET technologies. Here we exploit the most widely used transgenic mouse models of amyloid pathology in order to relate the imaging findings to our knowledge about the histopathological phenotype of these models. The development of new diagnostic criteria of AD necessitates the use of biological markers to diagnose AD even in the absence of overt dementia or early symptomatic mild cognitive impairment. The validity of the diagnosis will depend on the availability of an in vivo marker to reflect underlying neurobiological changes of AD. Transgenic models with essential features of AD pathology and mechanisms provide a test setting for the development and evaluation of new biological imaging markers. Among the best established imaging markers of amyloid pathology in transgenic animals are high-field MRI of brain atrophy, proton spectroscopy of neurochemical changes, high-field MRI of amyloid plaque load, and in vivo plaque imaging using radio-labelled ligands with PET. We discuss the implications of the findings as well as the methodological limitations and the specific requirements of these technologies. We furthermore outline future directions of transgene-imaging research. Transgene imaging is an emerging area of translational research that implies strong multi- and interdisciplinary collaborations. It will become ever more valuable with the introduction of new diagnostic standards and novel treatment approaches which will require valid and reliable biological markers to improve the diagnosis and early treatment of AD patients.","Neuronal and glial changes associated with tau, TAR DNA binding protein of ∼43 kDa (TDP-43), and fused in sarcoma (FUS) together constitute the pathologic spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Most patients with FTLD present with prominent behavior or language changes, sometimes accompanied by extrapyramidal symptoms or motor neuron disease. Identification of FTLD patients with mutations in genes for tau, TDP-43, and FUS lends strong support for their pathogenic roles in FTLD, and elucidation of their dysfunction will pave the way for development of substrate specific therapy. However, there remains no reliable biomarker for early detection of FTLD or prediction of underlying FTLD pathologic change. Clinical syndromes usually reflects the earliest affected brain regions where atrophy can be visualized on structural MRI, but neither clinical nor structural imaging-based biomarkers has been accurately correlated with underlying pathology on the individual patient level. Biochemical markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have also been investigated in FTLD and related disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, their accuracy and pathologic significance need to be confirmed in future multi-center studies. Here we review the progress made in FTLD biomarkers, including clinical phenotype/feature characterization, neuropsychological analysis, CSF and plasma analytes, and patterns of brain atrophy and network dysfunction detectable on brain imaging. Given the pathologic overlap of FTLD with ALS and PSP, collaboration with specialists in those fields will be essential in the translation of promising FTLD biomarkers into clinical practice.","The ALS/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam is a long latency disease with a diverse phenotypic expression characteristic of classical ALS, parkinsonism and dementia. It is remarkably similar to a syndrome localized to the Kii Peninsula of Japan. There are as yet no identified pathological features that will clearly distinguish the Guam or Kii ALS/PDC syndrome from other degenerative neurological disorders. At present, ALS/PDC of Guam and the Kii Peninsula can be confirmed only by postmortem examination. The most prominent pathological hallmark is the widespread occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles which express the same balance of 3R and 4R tau that is found in Alzheimer disease. They both show an increased prevalence of a peculiar retinal disorder termed linear retinal pigmentary epitheliopathy. The disorders are both highly familial. Several environmental factors have been proposed but no supportive evidence for an environmental or dietary factor has been found. Genome searches have so far failed to identify causative genes although two single nuclear polymorphisms related to MAPT that increase the risk of the Guam syndrome have been located. The two syndromes are clearly unique, and clues as to their causation could be beneficial in understanding the etiology of similar, but much more prevalent disorders in North America, Europe and Asia. Identification of biomarkers for premortem diagnosis would be helpful in management as well as in revealing the true etiology.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder leading to permanent disability in young adults in the developed world. While traditionally conceived as an autoimmune inflammatory disease it is becoming increasingly evident that axonal and neuronal degeneration occur, at least partly independent of inflammation, and already at the earliest stages of the disease. In addition, it is the progressive neurodegeneration which determines the amount of accumulating clinical disability. Therefore, MS should be considered as a neurodegenerative disorder. Development of disease-modifying drugs to treat MS is currently highly dynamic. Already, several drugs have shown short-term efficacy to delay progression of clinical disability, but the ultimate aim is to halt disease progression. In this context, the development of sensitive, reliable and valid biomarkers to measure neurodegeneration is an indispensible need to facilitate successful informative clinical trials. While no such biomarker is currently fully established, several promising candidate biomarkers obtained with multimodal techniques, including cerebrospinal fluid and serum analysis, neuroimaging and neurophysiology, are presently developed and evaluated. This paper compiles an up-to-date critical review of the available knowledge of candidate biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes in MS.","The diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases within neurology and psychiatry are hampered by the difficulty in getting biopsies and thereby validating the diagnosis by pathological findings. Biomarkers for other types of disease have been readily adopted into the clinical practice where for instance troponins are standard tests when myocardial infarction is suspected. However, the use of biomarkers for neurodegeneration has not been fully incorporated into the clinical routine. With the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that reflect pathological events within the central nervous system (CNS), important clinical diagnostic tools are becoming available. This review summarizes the most promising biomarker candidates that may be used to monitor different types of neurodegeneration and protein inclusions, as well as different types of metabolic changes, in living patients in relation to the clinical phenotype and disease progression over time. Our aim is to provide the reader with an updated lexicon on currently available biomarker candidates, how far they have come in development and how well they reflect pathogenic processes in different neurodegenerative diseases. Biomarkers for specific pathogenetic processes would also be valuable tools both to study disease pathogenesis directly in patients and to identify and monitor the effect of novel treatment strategies.","The development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease requires innovative trials with large numbers of subjects and long observation periods. The use of blood, cerebrospinal fluid or neuroimaging biomarkers is critical for the demonstration of disease-modifying therapy effects on the brain. Suitable biomarkers are those which reflect the progression of AD related molecular mechanisms and neuropathology, including amyloidogenic processing and aggregation, hyperphosphorylation, accumulation of tau and neurofibrillary tangles, progressive functional, metabolic and structural decline, leading to neurodegeneration, loss of brain tissue and cognitive symptoms. Biomarkers should be used throughout clinical trial phases I-III of AD drug development. They can be used to enhance inclusion and exclusion criteria, or as baseline predictors to increase the statistical power of trials. Validated and qualified biomarkers may be used as outcome measures to detect treatment effects in pivotal clinical trials. Finally, biomarkers can be used to identify adverse effects. Questions regarding which biomarkers should be used in clinical trials, and how, are currently far from resolved. The Oxford Task Force continues and expands the work of our previous international expert task forces on disease-modifying trials and on endpoints for Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. The aim of this initiative was to bring together a selected number of key international opinion leaders and experts from academia, regulatory agencies and industry to condense the current knowledge and state of the art regarding the best use of biological markers in Alzheimer's disease therapy trials and to propose practical recommendations for the planning of future AD trials.","The relationship between sleep and epilepsy has been known since ancient times, and the modulating effects of both on each other have been widely described in clinical studies. However, the mechanisms of this correlation remain unclear. Translational research is essential for filling the gaps in our knowledge, and for developing better therapeutic approaches to improve the quality of life of epileptic patients. Excellent animal models of epilepsy are available for the investigation of various aspects of epilepsy, such as epileptogenesis and hippocampal sclerosis. These models also show an association between sleep and epilepsy, suggesting that they are suitable for translational research on this relationship. While some knowledge has been obtained from preclinical studies, the topic remains relatively unexplored. In terms of the role of sleep in modulating seizure susceptibility in epilepsy, animal sleep research is a major tool. In this review, we focus on the intricate relationship between sleep and epilepsy in the preclinical setting, using a translational science approach.","The simplicity and accessibility of the olfactory systems of insects underlie a body of research essential to understanding not only olfactory function but also general principles of sensory processing. As insect olfactory neurobiology takes advantage of a variety of species separated by millions of years of evolution, the field naturally has yielded some conflicting results. Far from impeding progress, the varieties of insect olfactory systems reflect the various natural histories, adaptations to specific environments, and the roles olfaction plays in the life of the species studied. We review current findings in insect olfactory neurobiology, with special attention to differences among species. We begin by describing the olfactory environments and olfactory-based behaviors of insects, as these form the context in which neurobiological findings are interpreted. Next, we review recent work describing changes in olfactory systems as adaptations to new environments or behaviors promoting speciation. We proceed to discuss variations on the basic anatomy of the antennal (olfactory) lobe of the brain and higher-order olfactory centers. Finally, we describe features of olfactory information processing including gain control, transformation between input and output by operations such as broadening and sharpening of tuning curves, the role of spiking synchrony in the antennal lobe, and the encoding of temporal features of encounters with an odor plume. In each section, we draw connections between particular features of the olfactory neurobiology of a species and the animal's life history. We propose that this perspective is beneficial for insect olfactory neurobiology in particular and sensory neurobiology in general.","This review focuses on the possibility that autonomic activity influences cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism during exercise in humans. Apart from cerebral autoregulation, the arterial carbon dioxide tension, and neuronal activation, it may be that the autonomic nervous system influences CBF as evidenced by pharmacological manipulation of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic blockade by glycopyrrolate blocks the exercise-induced increase in the transcranial Doppler determined mean flow velocity (MCA Vmean). Conversely, alpha-adrenergic activation increases that expression of cerebral perfusion and reduces the near-infrared determined cerebral oxygenation at rest, but not during exercise associated with an increased cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO(2)), suggesting competition between CMRO(2) and sympathetic control of CBF. CMRO(2) does not change during even intense handgrip, but increases during cycling exercise. The increase in CMRO(2) is unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade even though CBF is reduced suggesting that cerebral oxygenation becomes critical and a limited cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension may induce fatigue. Also, sympathetic activity may drive cerebral non-oxidative carbohydrate uptake during exercise. Adrenaline appears to accelerate cerebral glycolysis through a beta2-adrenergic receptor mechanism since noradrenaline is without such an effect. In addition, the exercise-induced cerebral non-oxidative carbohydrate uptake is blocked by combined beta 1/2-adrenergic blockade, but not by beta1-adrenergic blockade. Furthermore, endurance training appears to lower the cerebral non-oxidative carbohydrate uptake and preserve cerebral oxygenation during submaximal exercise. This is possibly related to an attenuated catecholamine response. Finally, exercise promotes brain health as evidenced by increased release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the brain.","There is an increasing recognition that following traumatic brain injury, a cascade of inflammatory mediators is produced, and contributes to the pathological consequences of central nervous system injury. This review summarises the key literature from pre-clinical models that underlies our understanding of innate inflammation following traumatic brain injury before focussing on the growing evidence from human studies. In addition, the underlying molecular mediators responsible for blood brain barrier dysfunction have been discussed. In particular, we have highlighted the different sampling methodologies available and the difficulties in interpreting human data of this sort. Ultimately, understanding the innate inflammatory response to traumatic brain injury may provide a therapeutic avenue in the treatment of central nervous system disease.","Pax genes encode a family of transcription factors that have long been recognised as obligate contributors to embryonic development of the CNS, with evidence obtained from various animal models illustrating phylogenetically conserved functions. Within the CNS, Pax genes play substantial roles in cellular and regional specification, proliferation, progenitor cell maintenance, anti-apoptosis and neural differentiation. This comprehensive review details the critical functions of those Pax genes involved in pre- and post-natal CNS development, provides possible molecular mechanisms by which Pax genes contribute to proliferation and differentiation of neuronal cells, and explains observed changes in Pax gene expression in response to neurotrauma in the mature animal. Knowledge of the ability of individual Pax genes to specify precise lineages within the CNS is beneficial for cell replacement strategies, particularly in the production of ""designer"" cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The manipulation of stem or committed cells so that they express definitive Pax genes may indeed assist in the pursuit of the holy grail of regenerative medicine - that of CNS cell replacement therapies leading to functional repair. We explain here, however, that only the sophisticated and precise use of Pax genes will lead to a successful outcome.","Silent information regulator two proteins (sirtuins or SIRTs) are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). They suppress genome-wide transcription, yet upregulate a select set of proteins related to energy metabolism and pro-survival mechanisms, and therefore play a key role in the longevity effects elicited by calorie restriction. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the latest progress regarding the protective effects of sirtuins, with a focus on SIRT1. We first introduce the distribution of sirtuins in the brain and how their expression and activity are regulated. We then highlight their protective effects against common neurological disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, axonal injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we analyze the mechanisms underlying sirtuin-mediated neuroprotection, centering on their non-histone substrates such as DNA repair enzymes, protein kinases, transcription factors, and coactivators. Collectively, the information compiled here will serve as a comprehensive reference for the actions of sirtuins in the nervous system to date, and will hopefully help to design further experimental research and expand sirtuins as therapeutic targets in the future.","Gray matter loss in the cortex is extensive in schizophrenia, especially in the prefrontal-temporal-network (PTN). Several molecules such as neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its ErbB4 receptor are encoded by candidate susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. The question arises as to how these genes might contribute to the observed changes in gray matter. It is suggested that one pathway involves molecules such as NRG1/ErbB4 determining the efficacy of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) found on dendritic spines at synapses in the PTN. The growth of dendritic spines is modulated by NRG1/ErbB4 through NMDARs as these activate small Rho-GTPases, such as kalirin, which control the actin cytoskeleton in the spines responsible for their growth. Another pathway involves NRG1/ErbB determining the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the white matter as well as their capacity for myelination, the integrity of which determines the stability of nerve terminals on dendritic spines. A causal chain is established between failure of the products of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, the decrease of dendritic spines and synaptic terminals, and the loss of gray matter. It is suggested than an important focus for future research in schizophrenia is to identify interventions that prevent the loss of dendritic spines and synapses during the prodromal period or earlier during development as well as to re-establish dendritic spines and synapses lost subsequent to this period. This will help reestablish neural networks in the PTN and so the loss of gray matter in the PTN.","We describe the results of quantitative information theoretic analyses of neural encoding, particularly in the primate visual, olfactory, taste, hippocampal, and orbitofrontal cortex. Most of the information turns out to be encoded by the firing rates of the neurons, that is by the number of spikes in a short time window. This has been shown to be a robust code, for the firing rate representations of different neurons are close to independent for small populations of neurons. Moreover, the information can be read fast from such encoding, in as little as 20 ms. In quantitative information theoretic studies, only a little additional information is available in temporal encoding involving stimulus-dependent synchronization of different neurons, or the timing of spikes within the spike train of a single neuron. Feature binding appears to be solved by feature combination neurons rather than by temporal synchrony. The code is sparse distributed, with the spike firing rate distributions close to exponential or gamma. A feature of the code is that it can be read by neurons that take a synaptically weighted sum of their inputs. This dot product decoding is biologically plausible. Understanding the neural code is fundamental to understanding not only how the cortex represents, but also processes, information.","Brain morphology and function are susceptible to various psysiological influences, including changes in the immune system. Inflammation and autoimmunity are two principal immunological responses that can compromise the function of multiple organs and tissues, including the central nervous system. The present article reviews clinical and experimental evidence pointing to structural brain damage induced by chronic autoimmune and/or inflammatory processes. Largely due to the vast complexity of neuroendocrine and immune systems, most of the principal pathogenic circuits are far from elucidated. In addition to summarizing the current knowledge, this article aims to highlight the importance of interdisciplinary research and combined efforts of physicians and scientists in revealing the intricate links between immunity and mental health.","Purinergic neurotransmission, involving release of ATP as an efferent neurotransmitter was first proposed in 1972. Later, ATP was recognised as a cotransmitter in peripheral nerves and more recently as a cotransmitter with glutamate, noradrenaline, GABA, acetylcholine and dopamine in the CNS. Both ATP, together with some of its enzymatic breakdown products (ADP and adenosine) and uracil nucleotides are now recognised to act via P2X ion channels and P1 and P2Y G protein-coupled receptors, which are widely expressed in the brain. They mediate both fast signalling in neurotransmission and neuromodulation and long-term (trophic) signalling in cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Purinergic signalling is prominent in neurone-glial cell interactions. In this review we discuss first the evidence implicating purinergic signalling in normal behaviour, including learning and memory, sleep and arousal, locomotor activity and exploration, feeding behaviour and mood and motivation. Then we turn to the involvement of P1 and P2 receptors in pathological brain function; firstly in trauma, ischemia and stroke, then in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, as well as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Finally, the role of purinergic signalling in neuropsychiatric diseases (including schizophrenia), epilepsy, migraine, cognitive impairment and neuropathic pain will be considered.","Accumulating laboratory studies have implicated the mobilization of bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells in brain plasticity and stroke therapy. This mobilization of bone cells to the brain is an essential concept in regenerative medicine. Over the past ten years, mounting data have shown the ability of bone marrow-derived stem cells to mobilize from BM to the peripheral blood (PB) and eventually enter the injured brain. This homing action is exemplified in BM stem cell mobilization following ischemic brain injury. Various BM-derived cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and very small embryonic-like cells (VSELs) have been demonstrated to exert therapeutic benefits in stroke. Here, we discuss the current status of these BM-derived stem cells in stroke therapy, with emphasis on possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of action that mediate the cells' beneficial effects in the ischemic brain. When possible, we also discuss the relevance of this therapeutic regimen in other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.","Although the cardinal manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) are attributed to a decline in dopamine levels in the striatum, a breadth of non-motor features and treatment-related complications in which the serotonergic system plays a pivotal role are increasingly recognised. Serotonin (5-HT)-mediated neurotransmission is altered in PD and the roles of the different 5-HT receptor subtypes in disease manifestations have been investigated. The aims of this article are to summarise and discuss all published preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated the serotonergic system in PD and related animal models, in order to recapitulate the state of the current knowledge and to identify areas that need further research and understanding.","The nervous system and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract share several common features including reciprocal interconnections and several neurotransmitters and peptides known as gut peptides, neuropeptides or hormones. The processes of digestion, secretion of digestive enzymes and then absorption are regulated by the neuro-endocrine system. Luminal glucose enhances its own absorption through a neuronal reflex that involves capsaicin sensitive primary afferent (CSPA) fibres. Absorbed glucose stimulates insulin release that activates hepatoenteric neural pathways leading to an increase in the expression of glucose transporters. Adrenergic innervation increases glucose absorption through α1 and β receptors and decreases absorption through activation of α2 receptors. The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of diurnal variation in transporter expression and in anticipation to food intake. Vagal CSPAs exert tonic inhibitory effects on amino acid absorption. It also plays an important role in the mediation of the inhibitory effect of intestinal amino acids on their own absorption at the level of proximal or distal segment. However, chronic extrinsic denervation leads to a decrease in intestinal amino acid absorption. Conversely, adrenergic agonists as well as activation of CSPA fibres enhance peptides uptake through the peptide transporter PEPT1. Finally, intestinal innervation plays a minimal role in the absorption of fat digestion products. Intestinal absorption of nutrients is a basic vital mechanism that depends essentially on the function of intestinal mucosa. However, intrinsic and extrinsic neural mechanisms that rely on several redundant loops are involved in immediate and long-term control of the outcome of intestinal function.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a frequently fatal motor neuron disease without any cure. To find molecular therapeutic targets, several studies crossed transgenic ALS murine models with animals transgenic for some ALS target genes. We aimed to revise the new discoveries and new works in this field. We selected the 10 most promising genes, according to their capability when down-regulated or up-regulated in ALS animal models, for increasing life span and mitigating disease progression: XBP-1, NogoA and NogoB, dynein, heavy and medium neurofilament, NOX1 and NOX2, MLC-mIGF-1, NSE-VEGF, and MMP-9. Interestingly, some crucial modifier genes have been described as being involved in common pathways, the most significant of which are inflammation and cytoskeletal activities. The endoplasmic reticulum also seems to play an important role in ALS pathogenesis, as it is involved in different selected gene pathways. In addition, these genes have evident links to each other, introducing the hypothesis of a single unknown, common pathway involving all of these identified genes and others to be discovered.","GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult forebrain, where it activates ionotropic type A and metabotropic type B receptors. Early studies have shown that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition controls neuronal excitability and thus the occurrence of seizures. However, more complex, and at times unexpected, mechanisms of GABAergic signaling have been identified during epileptiform discharges over the last few years. Here, we will review experimental data that point at the paradoxical role played by GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanisms in synchronizing neuronal networks, and in particular those of limbic structures such as the hippocampus, the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, or the amygdala. After having summarized the fundamental characteristics of GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanisms, we will analyze their role in the generation of network oscillations and their contribution to epileptiform synchronization. Whether and how GABA(A) receptors influence the interaction between limbic networks leading to ictogenesis will be also reviewed. Finally, we will consider the role of altered inhibition in the human epileptic brain along with the ability of GABA(A) receptor-mediated conductances to generate synchronous depolarizing events that may lead to ictogenesis in human epileptic disorders as well.","Hypertension affects 26% of adults and is in constant progress related to increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. One-third of hypertensive patients may be successfully treated with one antihypertensive agent, one-third may require two agents and in the remaining patients will need three agents for effective blood pressure (BP) control. The development of new classes of antihypertensive agents with different mechanisms of action therefore remains an important goal. Brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) hyperactivity has been implicated in hypertension development and maintenance in several types of experimental and genetic hypertension animal models. Among the main bioactive peptides of the brain RAS, angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang III have similar affinities for type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) Ang II receptors. Following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection, Ang II and Ang III similarly increase arginine-vasopressin (AVP) release and BP. Blocking the brain RAS may be advantageous as it simultaneously (1) decreases sympathetic tone and consequently vascular resistance, (2) decreases AVP release, reducing blood volume and vascular resistance and (3) blocks angiotensin-induced baroreflex inhibition, decreasing both vascular resistance and cardiac output. However, as Ang II is converted to Ang III in vivo, the exact nature of the active peptide is not precisely determined. We summarize here the main findings identifying AngIII as one of the major effector peptides of the brain RAS in the control of AVP release and BP. Brain AngIII exerts a tonic stimulatory effect on BP in hypertensive rats, identifying brain aminopeptidase A (APA), the enzyme generating brain Ang III, as a potentially candidate target for hypertension treatment. This has led to the development of potent orally active APA inhibitors, such as RB150--the prototype of a new class of centrally acting antihypertensive agents.","Glutamatergic synapse development has been rigorously investigated for the past two decades at both the molecular and cell biological level yet a comparable intensity of investigation into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of GABAergic synapse development has been lacking until relatively recently. This review will provide a detailed overview of the current understanding of GABAergic synapse development with a particular emphasis on assembly of synaptic components, molecular mechanisms of synaptic development, and a subset of human disorders which manifest when GABAergic synapse development is disrupted. An unexpected and emerging theme from these studies is that glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development share a number of overlapping molecular and cell biological mechanisms that will be emphasized in this review.","The classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is described as a circulating hormone system focused on cardiovascular and body water regulation, with angiotensin II as its major effector. Detlef Ganten's discovery some years ago of an independent local brain RAS composed of the necessary functional components (angiotensinogen, peptidases, angiotensins and specific receptor proteins) significantly expanded the possible physiological and pharmacological functions of this system. This review first describes the enzymatic pathways resulting in active angiotensin ligands and their interaction with AT(1), AT(2) and AT(4) receptor proteins. We discuss the characterization and distribution of the AT(1) and AT(2) receptor subtypes and the current controversy over the identity of the AT(4) receptor subtype. Research findings favoring the candidates insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and the type 1 tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met, are presented. Next, we summarize current research efforts directed at the use of angiotensin analogues in the treatment of clinical disorders such as memory dysfunction, cerebral blood flow and cerebroprotection, stress, depression, alcohol consumption, seizure, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and diabetes. The use of ACE inhibitors, and AT(1) and/or AT(2) receptor blockers, has shown promise in the treatment of several of these pathologies. The development of blood-brain barrier penetrant AT(4) receptor agonists and antagonists is of major importance regarding the continuing evaluation of the efficacy of new treatment approaches.","Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine neurodegenerative disorders caused by an unstable CAG expansion in the codifying region of their respective associated genes. However, each polyQ disease displays a different symptomatic and pathoanatomic profile and the proteins involved share no homology outside the polyQ tract. This suggests that the other regions of the proteins and the cellular functions they mediate are important in defining disease progression and specificity. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the most common form of spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide, is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyQ expansion in ataxin-3 (atx3), a conserved and ubiquitous protein known to bind polyubiquitin chains and to function as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Atx3 has been linked to protein homeostasis maintenance, transcription, cytoskeleton regulation and myogenesis, but its precise biologic function remains a mystery, limiting the understanding of the mechanisms by which the mutated protein leads to the selective neuronal death profile observed in MJD patients. A number of recent evidence support the idea that the toxic entities behind neuronal demise may be either the dysfunctional expanded atx3 or the soluble amyloid-like oligomers formed by self-assembly of the aggregation-prone mutated protein. Expanded atx3 pathogenicity is likely the result of a series of events implicating both atx3 dysfunction and aggregation, possibly involving both full-length atx3 and polyQ-containing fragments that may act as seeds for protein aggregation. A deeper understanding of polyQ protein biology, the way the expansion alters their features, and the consequences of these changes for cell functioning and survival are sure to be of critical importance for developing future treatment of polyQ diseases.","Inflammation protects from dangerous stimuli, restoring normal tissue homeostasis. Inflammatory response in the nervous system (""neuroinflammation"") has distinct features, which are shared in several diseases. The retina is an immune-privileged site, and the tight balance of immune reaction can be disrupted and lead to age-related macular disease (AMD) and to its peculiar sign, the druse. Excessive activation of inflammatory and immunological cascade with subsequent induction of damage, persistent activation of resident immune cells, accumulation of byproducts that exceeds the normal capacity of clearance giving origin to a chronic local inflammation, alterations in the activation of the complement system, infiltration of macrophages, T-lymphocytes and mast-cells from the bloodstream, participate in the mechanisms which originate the drusen. In addition, aging of the retina and AMD involve also para-inflammation, by which immune cells react to persistent stressful stimuli generating low-grade inflammation, aimed at restoring function and maintaining tissue homeostasis by varying the set point in relation to the new altered conditions. This mechanism is also seen in the normal aging retina, but, in the presence of noxious stimuli as in AMD, it can become chronic and have an adverse outcome. Finally, autophagy may provide new insights to understand AMD pathology, due to its contribution in the removal of defective proteins. Therefore, the AMD retina can represent a valuable model to study neuroinflammation, its mechanisms and therapy in a restricted and controllable environment. Targeting these pathways could represent a new way to treat and prevent both exudative and dry forms of AMD.","The purpose of this review is to describe the molecular mechanisms in the striatum that mediate reward-based learning and action control during instrumental conditioning. Experiments assessing the neural bases of instrumental conditioning have uncovered functional circuits in the striatum, including dorsal and ventral striatal sub-regions, involved in action-outcome learning, stimulus-response learning, and the motivational control of action by reward-associated cues. Integration of dopamine (DA) and glutamate neurotransmission within these striatal sub-regions is hypothesized to enable learning and action control through its role in shaping synaptic plasticity and cellular excitability. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) appears to be particularly important for reward-based learning and action control due to its sensitivity to combined DA and glutamate receptor activation and its involvement in a range of cellular functions. ERK activation in striatal neurons is proposed to have a dual role in both the learning and performance factors that contribute to instrumental conditioning through its regulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and its modulation of intrinsic cellular excitability. Furthermore, perturbation of ERK activation by drugs of abuse may give rise to behavioral disorders such as addiction.","There is consensus that amelioration of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is most effective with L-DOPA (levodopa). However, this necessary therapeutic step is biased by an enduring belief that L-DOPA is toxic to the remaining substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons by itself, or by specific metabolites such as dopamine. The concept of L-DOPA toxicity originated from pre-clinical studies conducted mainly in cell culture, demonstrating that L-DOPA or its derivatives damage dopaminergic neurons due to oxidative stress and other mechanisms. However, the in vitro data remain controversial as some studies showed neuroprotective, rather than toxic action of the drug. The relevance of this debate needs to be considered in the context of the studies conducted on animals and in clinical trials that do not provide convincing evidence for L-DOPA toxicity in vivo. This review presents the current views on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative/proteolytic stress, the factors that can be affected by L-DOPA or its metabolites. We then critically discuss the evidence supporting the two opposing views on the effects of L-DOPA in vitro, as well as the animal and human data. We also address the problem of inadequate experimental models used in these studies. L-DOPA remains the symptomatic 'hero' of Parkinson's disease. Whether it contributes to degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, or is a 'scapegoat' for explaining undesirable or unexpected effects of the treatment, remains a hotly debated topic.","The glutamatergic pathway has been consistently involved in the physiopathology of depressive disorder. However a complete dissection and integration of its role in the context of other known mechanisms is lacking. We summarized and integrated the evidence of various levels of interaction between glutamatergic and monoaminergic pathways (see videos). We identified six molecular pathways, some of which with specific regional distribution within the brain. From the six pathways we identified the key proteins and their coding genes, we then provided a detailed list of possible candidates with practical suggestions for association studies planning.","Most spiking neurons are divided into functional compartments: a dendritic input region, a soma, a site of action potential initiation, an axon trunk and its collaterals for propagation of action potentials, and distal arborizations and terminals carrying the output synapses. The axon trunk and lower order branches are probably the most neglected and are often assumed to do nothing more than faithfully conducting action potentials. Nevertheless, there are numerous reports of complex membrane properties in non-synaptic axonal regions, owing to the presence of a multitude of different ion channels. Many different types of sodium and potassium channels have been described in axons, as well as calcium transients and hyperpolarization-activated inward currents. The complex time- and voltage-dependence resulting from the properties of ion channels can lead to activity-dependent changes in spike shape and resting potential, affecting the temporal fidelity of spike conduction. Neural coding can be altered by activity-dependent changes in conduction velocity, spike failures, and ectopic spike initiation. This is true under normal physiological conditions, and relevant for a number of neuropathies that lead to abnormal excitability. In addition, a growing number of studies show that the axon trunk can express receptors to glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine or biogenic amines, changing the relative contribution of some channels to axonal excitability and therefore rendering the contribution of this compartment to neural coding conditional on the presence of neuromodulators. Long-term regulatory processes, both during development and in the context of activity-dependent plasticity may also affect axonal properties to an underappreciated extent.","Evidence from lesion and cortical-slice studies implicate the neocortical cholinergic system in the modulation of sensory, attentional and memory processing. In this review we consider findings from sixty-three healthy human cholinergic functional neuroimaging studies that probe interactions of cholinergic drugs with brain activation profiles, and relate these to contemporary neurobiological models. Consistent patterns that emerge are: (1) the direction of cholinergic modulation of sensory cortex activations depends upon top-down influences; (2) cholinergic hyperstimulation reduces top-down selective modulation of sensory cortices; (3) cholinergic hyperstimulation interacts with task-specific frontoparietal activations according to one of several patterns, including: suppression of parietal-mediated reorienting; decreasing 'effort'-associated activations in prefrontal regions; and deactivation of a 'resting-state network' in medial cortex, with reciprocal recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal regions during performance-challenging conditions; (4) encoding-related activations in both neocortical and hippocampal regions are disrupted by cholinergic blockade, or enhanced with cholinergic stimulation, while the opposite profile is observed during retrieval; (5) many examples exist of an 'inverted-U shaped' pattern of cholinergic influences by which the direction of functional neural activation (and performance) depends upon both task (e.g. relative difficulty) and subject (e.g. age) factors. Overall, human cholinergic functional neuroimaging studies both corroborate and extend physiological accounts of cholinergic function arising from other experimental contexts, while providing mechanistic insights into cholinergic-acting drugs and their potential clinical applications.","Beginning with a prominent article by Crick and Koch in 1995 (Nature 375, 121-123), cognitive neuroscience has witnessed an intensive debate about whether or not neural activity in primary visual cortex correlates with conscious visual experience. While some studies--especially those employing functional magnetic resonance imaging--imply that this is the case, others--particularly those recording from single neurons--suggest that it is not. In the light of this ongoing controversy, it is surprising that the analogous question in other sensory modalities has received far less attention. The first part of the present article reviews studies relevant to the role of primary auditory and primary somatosensory cortices in conscious auditory and tactile experience. As will become evident, the results of these studies, at least at first sight, appear no less contradictory than those obtained in the visual modality--in fact, they evidence discrepancies that resemble those found in the visual system to an impressive degree. The second part of the article attempts to reconcile the seemingly contradictory data by suggesting that only activity induced in the primary sensory cortices through cortico-cortical top-down signals can become consciously accessible, whereas activity induced by bottom-up signals from the thalamus cannot. This conclusion is in line with the earlier proposals of several prominent neuroscientists that portrayed conscious perception as the result of an active interpretative process by the brain, rather than a passive reflection of the environment.","The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases has seen a constant increase in the global population, and is likely to be the result of extended life expectancy brought about by better health care. Despite this increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, there has been a dearth in the introduction of new disease-modifying therapies that are approved to prevent or delay the onset of these diseases, or reverse the degenerative processes in brain. Mounting evidence in the peer-reviewed literature shows that the etiopathology of these diseases is extremely complex and heterogeneous, resulting in significant comorbidity and therefore unlikely to be mitigated by any drug acting on a single pathway or target. A recent trend in drug design and discovery is the rational design or serendipitous discovery of novel drug entities with the ability to address multiple drug targets that form part of the complex pathophysiology of a particular disease state. In this review we discuss the rationale for developing such multifunctional drugs (also called designed multiple ligands or DMLs), and why these drug candidates seem to offer better outcomes in many cases compared to single-targeted drugs in pre-clinical studies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Examples are drawn from the literature of drug candidates that have already reached the market, some unsuccessful attempts, and others that are still in the drug development pipeline.","According to the classical hypothesis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics, CSF is produced inside the brain ventricles, than it circulates like a slow river toward the cortical subarachnoid space, and finally it is absorbed into the venous sinuses. Some pathological conditions, primarily hydrocephalus, have also been interpreted based on this hypothesis. The development of hydrocephalus is explained as an imbalance between CSF formation and absorption, where more CSF is formed than is absorbed, which results in an abnormal increase in the CSF volume inside the cranial CSF spaces. It is believed that the reason for the imbalance is the obstruction of the CSF pathways between the site of CSF formation and the site of its absorption, which diminishes or prevents CSF outflow from the cranium. In spite of the general acceptance of the classical hypothesis, there are a considerable number of experimental results that do not support such a hypothesis and the generally accepted pathophysiology of hydrocephalus. A recently proposed new working hypothesis suggests that osmotic and hydrostatic forces at the central nervous system microvessels are crucial for the regulation of interstial fluid and CSF volume which constitute a functional unit. Based on that hypothesis, the generally accepted mechanisms of hydrocephalus development are not plausible. Therefore, the recent understanding of the correlation between CSF physiology and the development of hydrocephalus has been thoroughly presented, analyzed and evaluated, and new insights into hydrocephalus etiopathology have been proposed, which are in accordance with the experimental data and the new working hypothesis.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2012 Jan;96(1):164.,"The brain is a highly adaptable organ that is capable of converting sensory information into changes in neuronal function. This plasticity allows behavior to be accommodated to the environment, providing an important evolutionary advantage. Neurons convert environmental stimuli into long-lasting changes in their physiology in part through the synaptic activity-regulated transcription of new gene products. Since the neurotransmitter-dependent regulation of Fos transcription was first discovered nearly 25 years ago, a wealth of studies have enriched our understanding of the molecular pathways that mediate activity-regulated changes in gene transcription. These findings show that a broad range of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators can be engaged by neuronal activity to sculpt complex programs of stimulus-regulated gene transcription. However, the shear scope of the transcriptional pathways engaged by neuronal activity raises the question of how specificity in the nature of the transcriptional response is achieved in order to encode physiologically relevant responses to divergent stimuli. Here we summarize the general paradigms by which neuronal activity regulates transcription while focusing on the molecular mechanisms that confer differential stimulus-, cell-type-, and developmental-specificity upon activity-regulated programs of neuronal gene transcription. In addition, we preview some of the new technologies that will advance our future understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of activity-regulated gene transcription in the brain.","Modifications of neuronal circuits allow the brain to adapt and change with experience. This plasticity manifests during development and throughout life, and can be remarkably long lasting. Evidence has linked activity-regulated gene expression to the long-term structural and electrophysiological adaptations that take place during developmental critical periods, learning and memory, and alterations to sensory map representations in the adult. In all these cases, the cellular response to neuronal activity integrates multiple tightly coordinated mechanisms to precisely orchestrate long-lasting, functional and structural changes in brain circuits. Experience-dependent plasticity is triggered when neuronal excitation activates cellular signaling pathways from the synapse to the nucleus that initiate new programs of gene expression. The protein products of activity-regulated genes then work via a diverse array of cellular mechanisms to modify neuronal functional properties. Synaptic strengthening or weakening can reweight existing circuit connections, while structural changes including synapse addition and elimination create new connections. Posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, often also dependent on activity, further modulate activity-regulated gene transcript and protein function. Thus, activity-regulated genes implement varied forms of structural and functional plasticity to fine-tune brain circuit wiring.","Dysfunctional homeostasis of transition metals is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although questioned by some, brain copper, zinc, and particularly iron overload are widely accepted features of AD which have led to the hypothesis that oxidative stress generated from aberrant homeostasis of these transition metals might be a pathogenic mechanism behind AD. This meta-analysis compiled and critically assessed available quantitative data on brain iron, zinc and copper levels in AD patients compared to aged controls. The results were very heterogeneous. A series of heavily cited articles from one laboratory reported a large increase in iron in AD neocortex compared to age-matched controls (p<0.0001) while seven laboratories failed to reproduce these findings reporting no significant difference between the groups (p=0.76). A more than three-fold citation bias was found to favor outlier studies reporting increases in iron and this bias was particularly prominent among narrative review articles. Additionally, while zinc was not significantly changed in the neocortex (p=0.29), copper was significantly depleted in AD (p=0.0003). In light of these findings, it will be important to re-evaluate the hypothesis that transition metal overload accounts for oxidative injury noted in AD.","Deficiency in repair of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. Many recent experimental results indicate that the post-mitotic neurons are particularly prone to accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions potentially leading to progressive neurodegeneration. Nucleotide excision repair is the cellular pathway responsible for removing helix-distorting DNA damage and deficiency in such repair is found in a number of diseases with neurodegenerative phenotypes, including Xeroderma Pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome. The main pathway for repairing oxidative base lesions is base excision repair, and such repair is crucial for neurons given their high rates of oxygen metabolism. Mismatch repair corrects base mispairs generated during replication and evidence indicates that oxidative DNA damage can cause this pathway to expand trinucleotide repeats, thereby causing Huntington's disease. Single-strand breaks are common DNA lesions and are associated with the neurodegenerative diseases, ataxia-oculomotor apraxia-1 and spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1. DNA double-strand breaks are toxic lesions and two main pathways exist for their repair: homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. Ataxia telangiectasia and related disorders with defects in these pathways illustrate that such defects can lead to early childhood neurodegeneration. Aging is a risk factor for neurodegeneration and accumulation of oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage may be linked with the age-associated neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutation in the WRN protein leads to the premature aging disease Werner syndrome, a disorder that features neurodegeneration. In this article we review the evidence linking deficiencies in the DNA repair pathways with neurodegeneration.","Synapses are specialized cell-cell contacts that mediate communication between neurons. Most excitatory synapses in the brain are housed on dendritic spines, small actin-rich protrusions extending from dendrites. During development and in response to environmental stimuli, spines undergo marked changes in shape and number thought to underlie processes like learning and memory. Improper spine development, in contrast, likely impedes information processing in the brain, since spine abnormalities are associated with numerous brain disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines and their resident synapses is therefore crucial to our understanding of cognition and disease. Rho-family GTPases, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, play essential roles in orchestrating the development and remodeling of spines and synapses. Precise spatio-temporal regulation of Rho GTPase activity is critical for their function, since aberrant Rho GTPase signaling can cause spine and synapse defects as well as cognitive impairments. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We propose that Rho-family GEFs and GAPs provide the spatiotemporal regulation and signaling specificity necessary for proper Rho GTPase function based on the following features they possess: (i) existence of multiple GEFs and GAPs per Rho GTPase, (ii) developmentally regulated expression, (iii) discrete localization, (iv) ability to bind to and organize specific signaling networks, and (v) tightly regulated activity, perhaps involving GEF/GAP interactions. Recent studies describe several Rho-family GEFs and GAPs that uniquely contribute to spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Here, we highlight several of these proteins and discuss how they occupy distinct biochemical niches critical for synaptic development.","Precise localization of various ion channels into proper subcellular compartments is crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Axonal K(+) channels that are activated by depolarization of the membrane potential participate in the repolarizing phase of the action potential, and hence regulate action potential firing patterns, which encode output signals. Moreover, some of these channels can directly control neurotransmitter release at axonal terminals by constraining local membrane excitability and limiting Ca(2+) influx. K(+) channels differ not only in biophysical and pharmacological properties, but in expression and subcellular distribution as well. Importantly, proper targeting of channel proteins is a prerequisite for electrical and chemical functions of axons. In this review, we first highlight recent studies that demonstrate different roles of axonal K(+) channels in the local regulation of axonal excitability. Next, we focus on research progress in identifying axonal targeting motifs and machinery of several different types of K(+) channels present in axons. Regulation of K(+) channel targeting and activity may underlie a novel form of neuronal plasticity. This research field can contribute to generating novel therapeutic strategies through manipulating neuronal excitability in treating neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and Alzheimer's disease.","Since its introduction in the 1980s, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has proven to be a versatile method to non-invasively study human brain function by reversibly altering ongoing neural processing. In addition, TMS has been explored as a therapeutic intervention in a number of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, our understanding of TMS-induced changes in neural activity patterns is still rather limited, particularly when it comes to changes in neural network dynamics beyond the cortical site directly targeted by TMS. In order to monitor both its local and remote neurophysiological effects, TMS has been combined with complementary neuroimaging methods that allow additional insights into how observed TMS effects at the behavioral level can be interpreted by taking into account the full scale of its impact throughout the brain. The current review provides a comprehensive overview of the existing multimodal TMS literature, covering studies in which TMS was combined with one of the three main neuroimaging modalities, namely Electroencephalography, Positron Emission Tomography, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Besides constituting a reflection of the status quo in this exciting multidisciplinary research field, this review additionally reveals both convergent and divergent observations across modalities that await corroboration or resolution, thereby further guiding ongoing basic research and providing useful constraints to optimize future clinical applications.","An understanding of how axons elongate is needed to develop rational strategies to treat neurological diseases and nerve injury. Growth cone-mediated neuronal elongation is currently viewed as occurring through cytoskeletal dynamics involving the polymerization of actin and tubulin subunits at the tip of the axon. However, recent work suggests that axons and growth cones also generate forces (through cytoskeletal dynamics, kinesin, dynein, and myosin), forces induce axonal elongation, and axons lengthen by stretching. This review highlights results from various model systems (Drosophila, Aplysia, Xenopus, chicken, mouse, rat, and PC12 cells), supporting a role for forces, bulk microtubule movements, and intercalated mass addition in the process of axonal elongation. We think that a satisfying answer to the question, ""How do axons grow?"" will come by integrating the best aspects of biophysics, genetics, and cell biology.","In neurological disorders in which the cross-talk between striatal and hippocampal memory systems is affected, such as epilepsy, Down syndrome and Huntington's disease, cell-type specific alterations in synaptic plasticity lead to distinctive patterns causing functional imbalance between the two memory systems. Despite the complex network in which their neuronal activity is likely to be engaged, a common property of striatal and hippocampal neurons is to undergo bidirectional synaptic plasticity that relies on activity of interneurons and correlates with specific learning skills. As interneuronal dysfunction plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of these disorders, interneurons can be viewed as critical elements in neurophysiological substrates of such flexible relationships between these two memory systems.","Neurotrophins are growth factors that, through variations in concentration and changes in receptor expression, regulate the formation of axons and dendrites during development and throughout adult life. Here we review these growth factors, particularly in the context of schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We first discuss emerging information derived from physiologically relevant organotypic cultures and in vivo studies regarding the effects of neurotrophins on the neuronal structure including pruning and GABAergic neurons. We then review postmortem studies of neurotrophin levels and their receptors in brains of individuals with schizophrenia, and compare them with what is known about neurotrophin effects on neuronal structure. This comparison indicates that only some neuropathological defects encountered in patients with schizophrenia can be explained by the single action of neurotrophins on dendrites and axons. However, we propose that a number of inconsistent findings and apparently unrelated results in the schizophrenia field can be reconciled if neurons are considered structurally plastic cells capable of extending and retracting dendrites and axons throughout life.","Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a peculiar proline-directed serine/threonine kinase. Unlike the other members of the Cdk family, Cdk5 is not directly involved in cell cycle regulation, being normally associated with neuronal processes such as migration, cortical layering and synaptic plasticity. This kinase is present mainly in post-mitotic neurons and its activity is tightly regulated by the interaction with the specific activators, p35 and p39. Despite its pivotal role in CNS development, Cdk5 dysregulation has been implicated in different pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and, most recently, prion-related encephalopathies (PRE). In these neurodegenerative conditions, Cdk5 overactivation and relocalization occurs upon association with p25, a truncated form of the normal activator p35. This activator switching will cause a shift in the phosphorylative pattern of Cdk5, with an alteration both in targets and activity, ultimately leading to neuronal demise. In AD and PRE, two disorders that share clinical and neuropathological features, Cdk5 dysregulation is a linking event between the major neuropathological markers: amyloid plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic and neuronal loss. Moreover, this kinase was shown to be involved in abortive cell cycle re-entry, a feature recently proposed as a possible step in the neuronal apoptosis mechanism of several neurological diseases. This review focuses on the role of Cdk5 in neurons, namely in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, synaptic function and cell survival, both in physiological and in pathological conditions, highlighting the relevance of Cdk5 in the main mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other brain pathologies.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The gradual, irreversible loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is the signature lesion of PD. Clinical symptoms of PD become apparent when 50-60% of nigral dopamine neurons are lost. PD progresses insidiously for 5-7 years (preclinical period) and then continues to worsen even under the symptomatic treatment. To determine what triggers the disease onset and what drives the chronic, self-propelling neurodegenerative process becomes critical and urgent, since lack of such knowledge impedes the discovery of effective treatments to retard PD progression. At present, available therapeutics only temporarily relieve PD symptoms. While the identification of causative gene defects in familial PD uncovers important genetic influences in this disease, the majority of PD cases are sporadic and idiopathic. The current consensus suggests that PD develops from multiple risk factors including aging, genetic predisposition, and environmental exposure. Here, we briefly review research on the genetic and environmental causes of PD. We also summarize very recent genome-wide association studies on risk gene polymorphisms in the emergence of PD. We highlight the new converging evidence on gene-environment interplay in the development of PD with an emphasis on newly developed multiple-hit PD models involving both genetic lesions and environmental triggers.","At the psychological level, the notion that emotional events may be better remembered is a long accepted view. Its translation into neurobiological mechanisms has led to the proposal of the 'emotional tag' concept, according to which, the activation of the amygdala by emotionality would result in modulation of neural plasticity in brain regions (e.g. hippocampus) involved in forming memory of the emotional event. In line with this idea, amygdala activation (by electrical stimulation or exposure to an emotional event) has been demonstrated to affect synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the mechanisms associated with the formation of a 'synaptic tag', which is a mechanism proposed to explain the specificity of synaptic plasticity, could subserve the effects of the 'emotional tag' on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The literature reviewed here supports this view but points also to additional factors that should be taken into consideration, such as intensity, duration, controllability of the emotional experience, age of exposure and relations between the emotional aspects of the experience and the event-to-be-remembered. These factors do not only affect the behavioral outcome of the stressful experience but also find their expression in variations in the neuronal and biochemical pathways that are activated, and in the way those will interact with memory formation mechanisms. While adding complexity to the notion of the 'emotional tag', taking such factors into consideration is likely to bring us closer to elucidating the neural mechanisms involved in emotional memory modulation and to our understanding of the neurobiology of associated disorders, such as PTSD.","The study of the cognitive and neural underpinnings of aesthetic appreciation by means of neuroimaging techniques has yielded a wealth of fascinating information. Although the results of these studies have been somewhat divergent, here we provide an integrative view of the early approaches, which identified some of the core mechanisms involved in aesthetic preference. Then, a number of more specific issues under the perspective of recent work are addressed. Finally, we propose a framework to accommodate these findings and we explore future prospects for the emerging field of neuroaesthetics.","This commentary on ideas about neural mechanisms underlying pain is aimed at providing perspective for a reader who does not work in the field of mammalian somatic sensation. It is not a comprehensive review of the literature. The organization is historical to chronicle the evolution of ideas. The aim is to call attention to source of concepts and how various ideas have fared over time. One difficulty in relating concepts about pain is that the term is used to refer to human and animal reactions ranging from protective spinal reflexes to complex affective behaviors. As a result, the spectrum of ""pain""-related neural organization extends to operation of multiple neuronal arrangements. Thinking about pain has shadowed progress in understanding biological mechanisms, in particular the manner of function of nervous systems. This essay concentrates on the evolution of information and concepts from the early 19th century to the present. Topics include the assumptions underlying currently active theories about pain mechanisms. At the end, brief consideration is given to present-day issues, e.g., chronic pain, central pain, and the view of pain as an emotion rather than a sensation. The conceptual progression shows that current controversies have old roots and that failed percepts often resurface after seemingly having been put to rest by argument and evidence.","The perirhinal cortex is located in a pivotal position to influence the flow of information into and out of the hippocampal formation. In this review, we examine the anatomical, physiological and functional properties of the rat perirhinal cortex. Firstly, we review the properties of the perirhinal cortex itself, we describe how it can be separated into two distinct subregions and consider how it differs from other neighbouring regions in terms of cell type, cellular organisation and its afferent and efferent projections. We review the forms of neurotransmission present in the perirhinal cortex and the morphological, electrophysiological and plastic properties of its neurons. Secondly, we review the perirhinal cortex in the context of its connections with other brain areas; focussing on the projections to cortical, subcortical and hippocampal/parahippocampal regions. Particular attention is paid the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of these projections. Thirdly, we review the main functions of the perirhinal cortex; its roles in perception, recognition memory, spatial and contextual memory and fear conditioning are explored. Finally, we discuss the idea of anatomical, electrophysiological and functional segregation within the perirhinal cortex itself and as part of a hippocampal-parahippocampal network and suggest that understanding this segregation is of critical importance in understanding the role and contributions made by the perirhinal cortex in general.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized clinically by an insidious decline in cognition. Much attention has been focused on proposed pathogenic mechanisms that relate Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology to cognitive symptoms, but compelling evidence now identifies early synaptic loss and dysfunction, which precede plaque and tangle formation, as the more probable initiators of cognitive impairment. Glutamate-mediated transmission is severely altered in AD. Glutamate receptor expression is most markedly altered in regions of the AD brain that show the greatest pathological changes. Signaling via glutamate receptors controls synaptic strength and plasticity, and changes in these parameters are likely to contribute to memory and cognitive deficits in AD. Glutamate receptor expression and activity are modulated by interactions with post-synaptic scaffolding proteins that augment the strength and direction of signal cascades initiated by glutamate receptor activity. Scaffold proteins offer promising targets for more focused and effective drug therapy. In consequence, interest is developing into the roles these proteins play in neurological disease. In this review we discuss disruptions to excitatory neurotransmission at the level of glutamate receptor-post-synaptic scaffolding protein interactions that may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in AD.","The anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and hippocampus form part of an interconnected prefrontal neocortical and limbic archicortical network that is dysregulated in major depressive disorders (MDD). Modulation of this prefrontal-limbic network (PLN) is principally through the hypothalamus, basal ganglia and midbrain. Here the likely mechanisms by which these modulations are affected are described and the implications of their failure for depression associated with suicidal diathesis, late-life and psychoses discussed.","Grey matter loss occurs in different components of the prefrontal-limbic network (PLN) implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). This must be accounted for by specific pathologies of cells and their processes that comprise the grey matter. In order to identify these a quantitative evaluation of the contributions of neurons, glial cells, blood vessels and extracellular space to the grey matter volume is determined. This forms the basis of evaluating the various claims that the core pathology of certain cell types and/or their processes are responsible for the grey matter loss. It is concluded that it is the loss of synapses and concomitantly that of the dendrites on which they normally impinge that accounts quantitatively for the major loss of grey matter in different components of the PLN in depression.","Our sense of hearing depends on precisely organized circuits that allow us to sense, perceive, and respond to complex sounds in our environment, from music and language to simple warning signals. Auditory processing begins in the cochlea of the inner ear, where sounds are detected by sensory hair cells and then transmitted to the central nervous system by spiral ganglion neurons, which faithfully preserve the frequency, intensity, and timing of each stimulus. During the assembly of auditory circuits, spiral ganglion neurons establish precise connections that link hair cells in the cochlea to target neurons in the auditory brainstem, develop specific firing properties, and elaborate unusual synapses both in the periphery and in the CNS. Understanding how spiral ganglion neurons acquire these unique properties is a key goal in auditory neuroscience, as these neurons represent the sole input of auditory information to the brain. In addition, the best currently available treatment for many forms of deafness is the cochlear implant, which compensates for lost hair cell function by directly stimulating the auditory nerve. Historically, studies of the auditory system have lagged behind other sensory systems due to the small size and inaccessibility of the inner ear. With the advent of new molecular genetic tools, this gap is narrowing. Here, we summarize recent insights into the cellular and molecular cues that guide the development of spiral ganglion neurons, from their origin in the proneurosensory domain of the otic vesicle to the formation of specialized synapses that ensure rapid and reliable transmission of sound information from the ear to the brain.","Low oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) occur in several physiological and pathological cellular situations such as embryogenesis and stem cell modulation (in terms of differentiation/proliferation), or ischemic stroke and cancer. On the other side of the coin, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is tightly controlled by the cell. ROS control redox sensitive signaling pathways and thus regulate cell physiology, such as programmed cell death, inflammation and/or stem cell modulation. Herein we analyze the role of hypoxia and ROS in the modulation of neuronal differentiation focusing on: (i) in vivo neurogenesis and (ii) in vitro neuronal differentiation from neural stem/precursor cells. In vivo, hypoxia promotes neurogenesis in embryos, newborns and adults, as well as in response to noxious stimuli such as ischemia. On the other hand, oxygen and ROS also play a role in in vitro neuronal differentiation. They further impact tumor growth by influencing cell proliferation and differentiation, such as in neuroblastoma development. Therefore, manipulating hypoxia and ROS production represents a useful therapeutic tool if one needs either to enhance or to modulate neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, such as in cell replacement or in malignant cell proliferation.","Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the main intermediate filament protein in mature astrocytes, but also an important component of the cytoskeleton in astrocytes during development. Major recent developments in astrocyte biology and the discovery of novel intermediate filament functions enticed the interest in the function of GFAP. The discovery of various GFAP splice variants gave an additional boost to explore this protein in more detail. The structural role of GFAP in astrocytes has been widely accepted for a long time, but over the years, GFAP has been shown to be involved in astrocyte functions, which are important during regeneration, synaptic plasticity and reactive gliosis. Moreover, different subpopulations of astrocytes have been identified, which are likely to have distinctive tasks in brain physiology and pathology, and which are not only classified by their spatial and temporal appearance, but also by their specific expression of intermediate filaments, including distinct GFAP isoforms. The presence of these isoforms enhances the complexity of the astrocyte cytoskeleton and is likely to underlie subtype specific functions. In this review we discuss the versatility of the GFAP cytoskeletal network from gene to function with a focus on astrocytes during human brain development, aging and disease.","Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are intracellular endosomal organelles characterized by multiple internal vesicles that are enclosed within a single outer membrane. MVBs were initially regarded as purely prelysosomal structures along the degradative endosomal pathway of internalized proteins. MVBs are now known to be involved in numerous endocytic and trafficking functions, including protein sorting, recycling, transport, storage, and release. This review of neuronal MVBs summarizes their research history, morphology, distribution, accumulation of cargo and constitutive proteins, transport, and theories of functions of MVBs in neurons and glia. Due to their complex morphologies, neurons have expanded trafficking and signaling needs, beyond those of ""geometrically simpler"" cells, but it is not known whether neuronal MVBs perform additional transport and signaling functions. This review examines the concept of compartment-specific MVB functions in endosomal protein trafficking and signaling within synapses, axons, dendrites and cell bodies. We critically evaluate reports of the accumulation of neuronal MVBs based on evidence of stress-induced MVB formation. Furthermore, we discuss potential functions of neuronal and glial MVBs in development, in dystrophic neuritic syndromes, injury, disease, and aging. MVBs may play a role in Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Niemann-Pick diseases, some types of frontotemporal dementia, prion and virus trafficking, as well as in adaptive responses of neurons to trauma and toxin or drug exposure. Functions of MVBs in neurons have been much neglected, and major gaps in knowledge currently exist. Developing truly MVB-specific markers would help to elucidate the roles of neuronal MVBs in intra- and intercellular signaling of normal and diseased neurons.","Cognitive impairment is commonly associated with the pain experience. This impairment represents a major obstacle to daily activities and rehabilitation, especially in the chronic pain population. Here we review clinical and preclinical studies that have investigated pain-related alterations in cognition. These include impaired attentional, executive and general cognitive functioning. We describe the anatomical, neurochemical and molecular substrates common to both cognitive processing and supraspinal pain processing, and present the evidence for their involvement in pain-related cognitive impairment. We also examine the added complexity of cognitive impairment caused by analgesic medications and how this can further impact on morbidity in chronic pain patients. The need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of both pain-induced and treatment-related cognitive impairment is highlighted. Further research in this area will aid our understanding of patient symptoms and their underlying pathophysiology, ultimately leading to increased provision of guided therapy.","Melatonin, the neurohormone of the pineal gland, is also produced by various other tissues and cells. It acts via G protein-coupled receptors expressed in various areas of the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Parallel signaling mechanisms lead to cell-specific control and recruitment of downstream factors, including various kinases, transcription factors and ion channels. Additional actions via nuclear receptors and other binding sites are likely. By virtue of high receptor density in the circadian pacemaker, melatonin is involved in the phasing of circadian rhythms and sleep promotion. Additionally, it exerts effects on peripheral oscillators, including phase coupling of parallel cellular clocks based on alternate use of core oscillator proteins. Direct central and peripheral actions concern the up- or downregulation of various proteins, among which inducible and neuronal NO synthases seem to be of particular importance for antagonizing inflammation and excitotoxicity. The methoxyindole is also synthesized in several peripheral tissues, so that the total content of tissue melatonin exceeds by far the amounts in the circulation. Emerging fields in melatonin research concern receptor polymorphism in relation to various diseases, the control of sleep, the metabolic syndrome, weight control, diabetes type 2 and insulin resistance, and mitochondrial effects. Control of electron flux, prevention of bottlenecks in the respiratory chain and electron leakage contribute to the avoidance of damage by free radicals and seem to be important in neuroprotection, inflammatory diseases and, presumably, aging. Newly discovered influences on sirtuins and downstream factors indicate that melatonin has a role in mitochondrial biogenesis.","Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals which, in addition to sporadic and familial modes of manifestation, can be acquired via an infectious route of propagation. In disease, the prion protein (PrP(C)) undergoes a structural transition to its disease-causing form (PrP(Sc)) with profoundly different physicochemical properties. Surprisingly, despite intense interest in the prion protein, its function in the context of other cellular activities has largely remained elusive. We recently employed quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the interactome of the prion protein in a murine neuroblastoma cell line (N2a), an established cell model for prion replication. Extensive bioinformatic analyses subsequently established an evolutionary link between the prion gene family and the family of ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like protein) metal ion transporters. More specifically, sequence alignments, structural threading data and multiple additional pieces of evidence placed a ZIP5/ZIP6/ZIP10-like ancestor gene at the root of the PrP gene family. In this review we examine the biology of prion proteins and ZIP transporters from the viewpoint of a shared phylogenetic origin. We summarize and compare available data that shed light on genetics, function, expression, signaling, post-translational modifications and metal binding preferences of PrP and ZIP family members. Finally, we explore data indicative of retropositional origins of the prion gene founder and discuss a possible function for the prion-like (PL) domain within ZIP transporters. While throughout the article emphasis is placed on ZIP proteins, the intent is to highlight connections between PrP and ZIP transporters and uncover promising directions for future research.","The aim of this paper is to identify current perspectives for cell therapy applied to traumatic injuries of the central nervous system (CNS). After using diverse types of cell therapy, at present there is a growing experimental evidence that transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) can be useful to reverse the sequels of trauma affecting the brain and spinal cord. Although we still do not know many details about how these cells achieve their beneficial effects, the application of BMSC in humans, for brain or spinal cord repair, is beginning. An exquisite caution and strict methodological controls are needed to determine with certainty whether we can open a door of hope for many patients who currently suffer severe neurological deficits that are now supposedly irreversible.","The expression and the role of the chemokine receptor CCR5 have been mainly studied in the context of HIV infection. However, this protein is also expressed in the brain, where it can be crucial in determining the outcome in response to different insults. CCR5 expression can be deleterious or protective in controlling the progression of certain infections in the CNS, but it is also emerging that it could play a role in non-infectious diseases. In particular, it appears that, in addition to modulating immune responses, CCR5 can influence neuronal survival. Here, we summarize the present knowledge about the expression of CCR5 in the brain and highlight recent findings suggesting its possible involvement in neuroprotective mechanisms.","Aging of the human brain is associated with ""normal"" functional, structural, and molecular changes that underlie alterations in cognition, memory, mood and motor function, amongst other processes. Normal aging also imposes a robust constraint on the onset of many neurological diseases, ranging from late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD), to early onset psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). The molecular mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of age-related changes in the brain are understudied, and, while they share some overlap with peripheral mechanisms of aging, many are unique to the largely non-mitotic brain. Hence, understanding mechanisms of brain aging and identifying associated modulators may have profound consequences for the prevention and treatment of age-related impairments and diseases. Here we review current knowledge on age-related functional and structural changes, their molecular and genetic underpinnings, and discuss how these pathways may contribute to the vulnerability to develop age-related neurological diseases. We highlight recent findings from human post-mortem brain microarray studies, which we hypothesize, point to a potential genetically controlled transcriptional program underlying molecular changes and age-gating of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for understanding basic mechanisms of brain aging and for the future investigation of therapeutic approaches.","Rapid technological advances over the past decade have moved us closer to a high throughput molecular approach to neurobiology, where we see the merging of neurogenetics, genomics, physiology, imaging and pharmacology. This is the case more in zebrafish than in any other model organism commonly used. Recent improvements in the generation of transgenic zebrafish now allow genetic manipulation and live imaging of neuronal development and function in early embryonic, larval, and adult animals. The sequenced zebrafish genome and comparative genomics give unprecedented insights into genome evolution and its relation to genome structure and function. There is now information on embryonic and larval expression of over 12,000 genes and just under 1000 mutant phenotypes. We review the remarkable similarity of the zebrafish genetic blueprint for the nervous system to that of mammals and assess recent technological advances that make the zebrafish a model of choice for elucidating the development and function of neuronal circuitry, transgene-based neuroanatomy, and small molecule neuropharmacology.","The way in which organisms detect specific volatile compounds within their environment, and the associated neural processing which produces perception and subsequent behavioural responses, have been of interest to scientists for decades. Initially, most olfaction research was conducted using electrophysiological techniques on whole animals. However, the discovery of genes encoding the family of human olfactory receptors (ORs) paved the way for the development of a range of cellular assays, primarily used to deorphan ORs from mammals and insects. These assays have greatly advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of olfaction, however, while there is currently good agreement on vertebrate and nematode olfactory signalling cascades, debate still surrounds the signalling mechanisms in insects. The inherent specificity and sensitivity of ORs makes them prime candidates as biological detectors of volatile ligands within biosensor devices, which have many potential applications. In the previous decade, researchers have investigated various technologies for transducing OR:ligand interactions into a readable format and thereby produce an olfactory biosensor (or bioelectronic nose) that maintains the discriminating power of the ORs in vivo. Here we review and compare the molecular mechanisms of olfaction in vertebrates and invertebrates, and also summarise the assay technologies utilising sub-tissue level sensing elements (cells and cell extracts), which have been applied to OR deorphanization and biosensor research. Although there are currently no commercial, ""field-ready"" olfactory biosensors of the kind discussed here, there have been several technological proof-of-concept studies suggesting that we will see their emergence within the next decade.","Surgical repair of severe peripheral nerve injuries represents not only a pressing medical need, but also a great clinical challenge. Autologous nerve grafting remains a golden standard for bridging an extended gap in transected nerves. The formidable limitations related to this approach, however, have evoked the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts as a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts. A tissue engineered nerve graft is typically constructed through a combination of a neural scaffold and a variety of cellular and molecular components. The initial and basic structure of the neural scaffold that serves to provide mechanical guidance and optimal environment for nerve regeneration was a single hollow nerve guidance conduit. Later there have been several improvements to the basic structure, especially introduction of physical fillers into the lumen of a hollow nerve guidance conduit. Up to now, a diverse array of biomaterials, either of natural or of synthetic origin, together with well-defined fabrication techniques, has been employed to prepare neural scaffolds with different structures and properties. Meanwhile different types of support cells and/or growth factors have been incorporated into the neural scaffold, producing unique biochemical effects on nerve regeneration and function restoration. This review attempts to summarize different nerve grafts used for peripheral nerve repair, to highlight various basic components of tissue engineered nerve grafts in terms of their structures, features, and nerve regeneration-promoting actions, and finally to discuss current clinical applications and future perspectives of tissue engineered nerve grafts.","Swimming movements in the leech and lamprey are highly analogous, and lack homology. Thus, similarities in mechanisms must arise from convergent evolution rather than from common ancestry. Despite over 40 years of parallel investigations into this annelid and primitive vertebrate, a close comparison of the approaches and results of this research is lacking. The present review evaluates the neural mechanisms underlying swimming in these two animals and describes the many similarities that provide intriguing examples of convergent evolution. Specifically, we discuss swim initiation, maintenance and termination, isolated nervous system preparations, neural-circuitry, central oscillators, intersegmental coupling, phase lags, cycle periods and sensory feedback. Comparative studies between species highlight mechanisms that optimize behavior and allow us a broader understanding of nervous system function.","The adult mammalian brain contains a population of neural stem cells that can give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and are thought to be involved in certain forms of memory, behavior, and brain injury repair. Neural stem cell properties, such as self-renewal and multipotency, are modulated by both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. Emerging evidence suggests that energy metabolism is an important regulator of neural stem cell function. Molecules and signaling pathways that sense and influence energy metabolism, including insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1)-FoxO and insulin/IGF-1-mTOR signaling, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), SIRT1, and hypoxia-inducible factors, are now implicated in neural stem cell biology. Furthermore, these signaling modules are likely to cooperate with other pathways involved in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. This review summarizes the current understanding of how cellular and systemic energy metabolism regulate neural stem cell fate. The known consequences of dietary restriction, exercise, aging, and pathologies with deregulated energy metabolism for neural stem cells and their differentiated progeny will also be discussed. A better understanding of how neural stem cells are influenced by changes in energy availability will help unravel the complex nature of neural stem cell biology in both the normal and diseased state.","Autosomal dominant mutations in the presenilin gene PSEN cause familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder pathologically characterized by intraneuronal accumulation and extracellular deposition of amyloid-β in plaques and intraneuronal, hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles. Presenilins (PS/PSENs) are part of the proteolytic γ-secretase complex, which cleaves substrate proteins within the membrane. Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase releases amyloid-β peptides. Besides its role in the processing of APP and other transmembrane proteins, presenilin plays an important role in neural progenitor cell maintenance and neurogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of presenilin in relation to neurogenesis and neurodegeneration and review the currently available presenilin animal models. In addition to established mouse models, zebrafish are emerging as an attractive vertebrate model organism to study the role of presenilin during the development of the nervous system and in neurodegenerative disorders involving presenilin. Zebrafish is a suitable model organism for large-scale drug screening, making this a valuable model to identify novel therapeutic targets for AD.","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that activates neurons via generation of brief pulses of high-intensity magnetic field. If these pulses are applied in a repetitive fashion (rTMS), persistent modulation of neural excitability can be achieved. The technique has proved beneficial in the treatment of a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, the effect of rTMS on excitability and the other performance indicators shows a considerable degree of variability across different sessions and subjects. The frequency of stimulation has always been considered as the main determinant of the direction of excitability modulation. However, interactions exist between frequency and several other stimulation parameters that also influence the degree of modulation. In addition, the spatial interaction of the transient electric field induced by the TMS pulse with the cortical neurons is another contributor to variability. Consideration of all of these factors is necessary in order to improve the consistency of the conditioning effect and to better understand the outcomes of investigations with rTMS. These user-controlled sources of variability are discussed against the background of the mechanisms that are believed to drive the excitability changes. The mechanism behind synaptic plasticity is commonly accepted as the driver of sustained excitability modulation for rTMS and indeed, plasticity and rTMS share many characteristics, but definitive evidence is lacking for this. It is more likely that there is a multiplicity of mechanisms behind the action of rTMS. The different mechanisms interact with each other and this will contribute to the variability of rTMS-induced excitability changes. This review investigates the links between rTMS and synaptic plasticity, describes their similarities and differences, and highlights a neglected contribution of the membrane potential. In summary, the principal aims of this review are (i) to discuss the different experimental and subject-related factors that contribute to the variability of excitability modulation induced by rTMS, and (ii) to discuss a generalized underlying mechanism for the excitability modulation.","Alzheimer's disease is a tauopathy which involves the deposition of microtubule-associated tau proteins into neurofibrillary tangles. Post-translational modifications, in particular site-specific phosphorylations, affect the conformation of tau protein which is an intrinsically disordered protein. These structural changes significantly increase the affinity of tau protein for certain molecular chaperones. Hsp90 is a major cellular chaperone which assembles large complexes with a variety of co-chaperones. The main function of Hsp90 complexes is to maintain protein quality control and assist in protein degradation via proteasomal and autophagic-lysosomal pathways. Tau protein is a client protein for these Hsp90 complexes. If the tau protein is in an abnormal or modified form, then it can trigger the recruitment of CHIP protein, a co-chaperone with E3 activity, to the complex which induces the ubiquitination of tau protein and activates its downstream degradation processes. Large immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52 are also co-chaperones of Hsp90-tau complexes. These proteins contain peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase activity which catalyzes phosphorylation-dependent rotation in pSer/Thr-Pro peptide bond. The proline switch in the tau conformation triggers dephosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues phosphorylated, e.g. by two well-known tau kinases Cdk5 and GSK-3β. Binding of PP5 protein phosphatase to Hsp90 complex, can also dephosphorylate tau protein. Subsequently, dephosphorylated tau protein can be shuttled back to the microtubules. It seems that high-affinity binding of abnormal tau to Hsp90 complexes may have some counteracting effects on the aggregation process, since Hsp90 inhibitors can ameliorate the aggregation process in several neurodegenerative diseases. We will review the role of Hsp90 chaperone network in the regulation of tau biology and pathology in Alzheimer's disease.","During recent decades, several research teams engaged in unraveling the molecular structure and the physiological significance of pigment dispersing hormone-like peptides, particularly with respect to colour change and biological rhythms. In this review, we first summarise the entire history of pigment dispersing hormone-like peptide research, thus providing a stepping stone for those who are curious about this growing area of interest. Next, we try to bring order in the plethora of experimental data on the molecular structure of the various peptides and receptors and also discuss immunolocalization, time-related expression and suggested functions in crustaceans, insects and nematodes. In addition, a brief comparison with the vertebrate system is made.","Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have shown that nociceptive stimuli elicit responses in an extensive cortical network including somatosensory, insular and cingulate areas, as well as frontal and parietal areas. This network, often referred to as the ""pain matrix"", is viewed as representing the activity by which the intensity and unpleasantness of the perception elicited by a nociceptive stimulus are represented. However, recent experiments have reported (i) that pain intensity can be dissociated from the magnitude of responses in the ""pain matrix"", (ii) that the responses in the ""pain matrix"" are strongly influenced by the context within which the nociceptive stimuli appear, and (iii) that non-nociceptive stimuli can elicit cortical responses with a spatial configuration similar to that of the ""pain matrix"". For these reasons, we propose an alternative view of the functional significance of this cortical network, in which it reflects a system involved in detecting, orienting attention towards, and reacting to the occurrence of salient sensory events. This cortical network might represent a basic mechanism through which significant events for the body's integrity are detected, regardless of the sensory channel through which these events are conveyed. This function would involve the construction of a multimodal cortical representation of the body and nearby space. Under the assumption that this network acts as a defensive system signaling potentially damaging threats for the body, emphasis is no longer on the quality of the sensation elicited by noxious stimuli but on the action prompted by the occurrence of potential threats.","In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies, including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed. This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and perinatal life; these include infections [e.g. rubella, influenza, Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)], nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D), paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and complications, maternal stress and other exposures [e.g. lead, rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed. Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new, larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability, are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have important implications for the identification of causes and prevention of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine, existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models.","Multiple lines of evidence in schizophrenia, from brain imaging, studies in postmortem brains, and genetic association studies, have implicated oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction in this disease. Recent studies suggest that oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction leads to changes in synaptic formation and function, which could lead to cognitive dysfunction, a core symptom of schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is accumulating data linking oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction with dopamine and glutamate abnormalities, both of which are found in schizophrenia. These findings implicate oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction as a primary change in schizophrenia, not only as secondary consequences of the illness or treatment. Strategies targeting oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities could therefore provide therapeutic opportunities for patients suffering from schizophrenia.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Due to its high prevalence, MS is the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults in the United States and Europe. The clinical disease course is variable and starts with reversible episodes of neurological disability in the third or fourth decade of life. This transforms into a disease of continuous and irreversible neurological decline by the sixth or seventh decade. Available therapies for MS patients have little benefit for patients who enter this irreversible phase of the disease. It is well established that irreversible loss of axons and neurons are the major cause of the irreversible and progressive neurological decline that most MS patients endure. This review discusses the etiology, mechanisms and progress made in determining the cause of axonal and neuronal loss in MS.","Despite all the recent progress in neuroscience, we still do not understand the basic principles according to which the brain functions. This may be due, at least in part, to our lack of knowledge how the brain's intrinsic activity, the brain's input, impacts stimulus-induced changes in the brain. We here discuss the neuronal, experimental and methodological relevance of the brain's resting state activity for future studies. Furthermore, we make several suggestions how to best define and include the brain's resting state into our experimental designs. We conclude that experimental consideration of the brain's resting state has major implications for setting up experimental designs and methodological strategies. This may also shed new light on some hitherto unresolved questions like the neuroscientific mechanisms underlying consciousness and psychiatric disorders.","Parkinson's disease (PD) was one of the first neurological disorders to have aspects of the disease modeled faithfully in non-human animal species. A key feature of the disease is a diminished control over voluntary movement and progressive depletion of brain dopamine (DA) levels that stems from the large-scale loss of DA-producing neurons. Despite their inherent limitations, rodent and non-human primate models of PD have helped unravel several aspects of PD pathogenesis. Thus, we now have neurotransmitter replacement therapy for PD, and a number of neuroprotective compounds that can be assessed in clinical trials. However, no treatment is currently available that can halt or retard the progressive loss of DA neurons, which underlies PD pathology. Moreover, no therapies can permanently alleviate the clinical features of the disease. The lack of a cure or long-term effective treatment is paralled by our incomplete understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms of the disease. A range of robust, flexible, and complementary animal models will be an invaluable tool with which to unravel the pathogenesis of PD. Here we review the most important contributions made by non-mammalian model organisms. These include zebrafish (Danio rerio), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), anurans (frogs and toads) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans). While it is not anticipated that they will replace rodent and primate-based ones, they offer convenient systems with which to explore the relative contribution made by genetic and environmental factors to PD pathology. In addition, they offer an economic and rapid alternative for testing compounds that target PD. Most importantly, the combined use of these models allow for ongoing research to uncover the basic mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis.","Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) constitute a unique population of glia that accompany and ensheath the primary olfactory axons. They are thought to be critical for spontaneous growth of olfactory axons within the developing and adult olfactory nervous system, and have recently emerged as potential candidates for cell-mediated repair of neural injuries. Here, based on the current research, we give an overview of the biology of OECs in neural development and regeneration. This review starts with a detailed description of the cellular and molecular biological properties of OECs. Their functions in olfactory neurogenesis, olfactory axonal growth and olfactory bulb formation are sequently discussed. We also describe therapeutic applications of OECs for the treatment of a variety of neural lesions, including spinal cord injury, stroke, degenerative diseases, and PNS injuries. Finally, we address issues that may foster a better understanding of OECs in neural development and regeneration.","The multifaceted concept of impulsivity implies that different impulsivity aspects, mediated by different neural processes, influence behavior at different levels. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the neural processes regulating impulsivity. In this review, we discuss the findings of lesion studies in animals and functional imaging studies in humans focusing on the role of the NAc in impulsivity. Evidence supports that the extent and pattern of involvement of the NAc, and its subregions, the core and the shell, vary among different facets of impulsivity. Data from imaging studies reviewed in this article suggest the involvement of the ventral striatum/NAc in impulsive choice. Findings of animal studies indicate that lesions of the NAc core subregion facilitated impulsivity in tasks involving intertemporal choice, and promoted a risk-averse, less impulsive, tendency in tasks involving options with probability differences. Modification of neurotransmitter activity, especially of dopamine, which is proposed to underlie the changes observed in functional imaging studies, has been shown to influence afferent input pattern in the NAc and the generation of the behavioral output. Parameters of behavioral tasks reflecting response inhibition function are altered by neurochemical interventions and local electrical stimulation in both the core and the shell subregions. In toto, NAc's pattern of neuronal activity, either genetically determined or acquired, has a critical impact on the interindividual variation in the expression of impulsivity. Nevertheless, the NAc is not the only substrate responsible for impulsivity and it is not involved in each facet of impulsivity to the same extent.","Daily and annual changes in ambient illumination serve as specific stimuli that associate light with time and regulate the physiology of the organism through the eye. The eye acts as a dual sense organ linking light and vision, and detecting light that provides specific stimuli for non-classical photoreceptors located in the inner retina. These photoreceptors convey information to the master circadian pacemaker, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Responsible for sensing the light that regulates several non-visual functions (i.e. behavior, pupil reflex, sleep, and pineal melatonin production), the retina plays a key role in the temporal symphony orchestra playing the musical score of life: it is intrinsically rhythmic in its physiological and metabolic activities. We discuss here recent evidence in support of the hypothesis that retinal oscillators distributed over different cell populations may act as clocks, inducing changes in the visual and circadian system according to the time of the day. Significant progress has recently been made in identifying photoreceptors/photopigments localized in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that set circadian rhythms and modulate non-visual functions. Autonomous retinal and brain oscillators could have a more complex organization than previously recognized, involving a network of ""RGC clock/SCN clock cross-talk"". The convergence of oscillatory and photoreceptive capacities of retinal cells could deeply impact on the circadian system, which in turn may be severely impaired in different retinal pathologies. The aim of this review is to discuss the state of the art on inner retinal cell involvement in the light and temporal regulation of health and disease.","Anesthesia is a state of drug-induced unconsciousness with suppression of sensory perception, and consists of both hypnotic and analgesic components. The anesthesiologist monitors the clinical response to noxious stimuli and adjusts drug dosage(s) to achieve an adequate depth of anesthesia, with the aim of reducing operative stress. Acute stress in the perioperative period has four major contributors: anxiety, pain, the surgical stress response, and the potential neurotoxicity of anesthetic agents. Any or all of these may act deleteriously on multiple systems in the brain and have known significant effects on brain regions such as the hippocampus and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Perioperative stress on the nervous system and the resultant central nervous system (CNS) changes are likely to be causative for altered behaviors that are seen postoperatively, including chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and learning difficulties. Improving the ability of the anesthesiologist to control all four components of acute perioperative stress could potentially reduce the negative impact of surgery on the brain. Currently, there is no objective measurement for any of these stressors. The development and application of objective measures for perioperative stressors is the first step towards controlling these risk factors and eliminating or reducing their serious postoperative consequences. In this paper we review known and likely effects of perioperative stressors on brain systems and how they may play a significant role in altered postoperative behaviors. We discuss the role of current (and developing) measures of brain function and their potential for monitoring perioperative stress, with an emphasis on functional neuroimaging.","Computer models of microtubule dynamics have provided the basis for many of the theories on the cellular mechanics of the microtubules, their polymerization kinetics, and the diffusion of tubulin and tau. In the three-dimensional model presented here, we include the effects of tau concentration and the hydrolysis of GTP-tubulin to GDP-tubulin and observe the emergence of microtubule dynamic instability. This integrated approach simulates the essential physics of microtubule dynamics in a cellular environment. The model captures the structure of the microtubules as they undergo steady state dynamic instabilities in this simplified geometry, and also yields the average number, length, and cap size of the microtubules. The model achieves realistic geometries and simulates cellular structures found in degenerating neurons in disease states such as Alzheimer disease. Further, this model can be used to simulate microtubule changes following the addition of antimitotic drugs which have recently attracted attention as chemotherapeutic agents.","Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to have powerful beneficial effects on a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that EE can mimic positive life experiences and prevent the development of drug addiction. More recently, EE has also been shown to eliminate already developed addiction-related behaviors and to reduce the risks of relapse. These preventive and ""curative"" effects of EE are associated with dramatic plastic changes in several brain areas such as the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the striatum. EE alters neurotransmitter systems, produces changes in gene expression and transcription factors, induces chromatin rearrangement, and stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we review the existent literature on behavioral, neurochemical, cellular and molecular effects of EE and we discuss different possible ways in which EE-induced neuroadaptations result in decreased vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We propose a unified theoretical framework in which EE is seen as a functional opposite of stress. On the one hand, the antistress effects of EE would reduce the reinforcing effects of drugs and their ability to induce long-lasting neuroplastic changes and, thus, they would prevent the development of drug addiction. On the other hand, permanent or transient restoration of the normal, pre-drug functioning of the stress system would facilitate resisting prepotent desire to take drug and it would decrease the risks of relapse. This theoretical framework highlights the importance of stress in each phase of drug addiction and strongly suggests that life conditions of abstinent addicts should be considered as part of their treatment.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most lethal stroke subtypes. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with ICH, its pathophysiology has not been investigated as well as that of ischemic stroke. Available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in the progression of ICH-induced secondary brain injury. For example, in preclinical ICH models, microglial activation has been shown to occur within 1h, much earlier than neutrophil infiltration. Recent advances in our understanding of neuroinflammatory pathways have revealed several new molecular targets, and related therapeutic strategies have been tested in preclinical ICH models. This review summarizes recent progress made in preclinical models of ICH, surveys preclinical and clinical studies of inflammatory cells (leukocytes, macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes) and inflammatory mediators (matrix metalloproteinases, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, heme oxygenase, and iron), and highlights the emerging areas of therapeutic promise.","The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, in part due to changes in local protein synthesis. Activation of TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) receptors for BDNF triggers several parallel signaling pathways, including the Ras/ERK, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the phospholipase C-γ pathways. Recent studies have elucidated some of the signaling mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of translation activity by BDNF, through modulation of initiation and elongation phases, but the resulting changes in the proteome are not yet fully characterized. The proteins synthesized in response to activation of TrkB receptors by BDNF depend on the mRNAs that are available locally, after delivery and transport along dendrites. Recent studies have shown that BDNF may also play a regulatory role at this level. Furthermore, BDNF regulates transcription activity, thereby affecting the array of mRNAs available to be transported along dendrites. This review highlights the recent advances in the understanding of the diversity of mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of the synaptic proteome by BDNF, which may account for its role in synaptic plasticity.","Peripheral nerve injuries that induce gaps larger than 1-2 cm require bridging strategies for repair. Autologous nerve grafts are still the gold standard for such interventions, although alternative treatments, as well as treatments to improve the therapeutic efficacy of autologous nerve grafting are generating increasing interest. Investigations are still mostly experimental, although some clinical studies have been undertaken. In this review, we aim to describe the developments in bridging technology which aim to replace the autograft. A multi-disciplinary approach is of utmost importance to develop and optimise treatments of the most challenging peripheral nerve injuries.","Electroporation is a widely used technique for enhancing the efficiency of DNA delivery into cells. Application of electric pulses after local injection of DNA temporarily opens cell membranes and facilitates DNA uptake. Delivery of plasmid DNA by electroporation to alter gene expression in tissue has also been explored in vivo. This approach may constitute an alternative to viral gene transfer, or to transgenic or knock-out animals. Among the most frequently electroporated target tissues are skin, muscle, eye, and tumors. Moreover, different regions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the developing neural tube and the spinal cord, as well as prenatal and postnatal brain have been successfully electroporated. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the literature describing electroporation of the CNS with a focus on the adult brain. In addition, the mechanism of electroporation, different ways of delivering the electric pulses, and the risk of damaging the target tissue are highlighted. Electroporation has been successfully used in humans to enhance gene transfer in vaccination or cancer therapy with several clinical trials currently ongoing. Improving the knowledge about in vivo electroporation will pave the way for electroporation-enhanced gene therapy to treat brain carcinomas, as well as CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression.","Most current computational models of neocortical networks assume a homogeneous and isotropic arrangement of local synaptic couplings between neurons. Sparse, recurrent connectivity is typically implemented with simple statistical wiring rules. For spatially extended networks, however, such random graph models are inadequate because they ignore the traits of neuron geometry, most notably various distance dependent features of horizontal connectivity. It is to be expected that such non-random structural attributes have a great impact, both on the spatio-temporal activity dynamics and on the biological function of neocortical networks. Here we review the neuroanatomical literature describing long-range horizontal connectivity in the neocortex over distances of up to eight millimeters, in various cortical areas and mammalian species. We extract the main common features from these data to allow for improved models of large-scale cortical networks. Such models include, next to short-range neighborhood coupling, also long-range patchy connections. We show that despite the large variability in published neuroanatomical data it is reasonable to design a generic model which generalizes over different cortical areas and mammalian species. Later on, we critically discuss this generalization, and we describe some examples of how to specify the model in order to adapt it to specific properties of particular cortical areas or species.","The scientific understanding of preproglucagon derived peptides has provided people with type 2 diabetes with two novel classes of glucose lowering agents, the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. For the scientists, the novel GLP-1 agonists, and DPP-IV inhibitors have evolved as useful tools to understand the role of the preproglucagon derived peptides in normal physiology and disease. However, the overwhelming interest attracted by GLP-1 analogues as potent incretins has somewhat clouded the efforts to understand the importance of preproglucagon derived peptides in other physiological contexts. In particular, our neurobiological understanding of the preproglucagon expressing neuronal pathways in the central nervous system as well as the degree to which central GLP-1 receptors are targeted by peripherally administered GLP-1 receptor agonists is still fairly limited. The role of GLP-1 as an anorectic neurotransmitter is well recognized, but clarification of the neuronal targets and physiological basis of this response is further warranted, as is the mapping of GLP-1 sensitive neurons involved in a variety of neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. Further recent evidence points to GLP-1 as a central neuropeptide with neuroprotective capabilities potentially mitigating a wide array of neurodegenerative conditions. It is the aim of the present review to summarize our current understanding of preproglucagon derived peptides as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.","Neurons that produce histamine are exclusively located in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and send widespread projections to almost all brain areas. Neuronal histamine is involved in many physiological and behavioral functions such as arousal, feeding behavior and learning. Although conflicting data have been published, several studies have also demonstrated a role of histamine in the psychomotor and rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Pharmacological and brain lesion experiments initially led to the proposition that the histaminergic system exerts an inhibitory influence on drug reward processes, opposed to that of the dopaminergic system. The purpose of this review is to summarize the relevant literature on this topic and to discuss whether the inhibitory function of histamine on drug reward is supported by current evidence from published results. Research conducted during the past decade demonstrated that the ability of many antihistaminic drugs to potentiate addiction-related behaviors essentially results from non-specific effects and does not constitute a valid argument in support of an inhibitory function of histamine on reward processes. The reviewed findings also indicate that histamine can either stimulate or inhibit the dopamine mesolimbic system through distinct neuronal mechanisms involving different histamine receptors. Finally, the hypothesis that the histaminergic system plays an inhibitory role on drug reward appears to be essentially supported by place conditioning studies that focused on morphine reward. The present review suggests that the development of drugs capable of activating the histaminergic system may offer promising therapeutic tools for the treatment of opioid dependence.","Recent research focusing on the participation of astrocytes in glutamatergic tripartite synapses has revealed mechanisms that support cognitive functions common to human and other mammalian species, such as learning, perception, conscious integration, memory formation/retrieval and the control of voluntary behavior. Astrocytes can modulate neuronal activity by means of release of glutamate, d-serine, adenosine triphosphate and other signaling molecules, contributing to sustain, reinforce or depress pre- and post-synaptic membranes. We review molecular mechanisms present in tripartite synapses and model the cognitive role of astrocytes. Single protoplasmic astrocytes operate as a ""Local Hub"", integrating information patterns from neuronal and glial populations. Two mechanisms, here modeled as the ""domino"" and ""carousel"" effects, contribute to the formation of intercellular calcium waves. As waves propagate through gap junctions and reach other types of astrocytes (interlaminar, polarized, fibrous and varicose projection), the active astroglial network functions as a ""Master Hub"" that integrates results of distributed processing from several brain areas and supports conscious states. Response of this network would define the effect exerted on neuronal plasticity (membrane potentiation or depression), behavior and psychosomatic processes. Theoretical results of our modeling can contribute to the development of new experimental research programs to test cognitive functions of astrocytes.","Cannabis use during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychotic disorders later in life. However, the neurobiological processes underlying this relationship are unknown. This review reports the results of a literature search comprising various neurobiological disciplines, ultimately converging into a model that might explain the neurobiology of cannabis-induced schizophrenia. The article briefly reviews current insights into brain development during adolescence. In particular, the role of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in experience-dependent maturation of specific cortical circuitries is examined. The review also covers recent hypotheses regarding disturbances in strengthening and pruning of synaptic connections in the prefrontal cortex, and the link with latent psychotic disorders. In the present model, cannabis-induced schizophrenia is considered to be a distortion of normal late postnatal brain maturation. Distortion of glutamatergic transmission during critical periods may disturb prefrontal neurocircuitry in specific brain areas. Our model postulates that adolescent exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive substance in cannabis, transiently disturbs physiological control of the endogenous cannabinoid system over glutamate and GABA release. As a result, THC may adversely affect adolescent experience-dependent maturation of neural circuitries within prefrontal cortical areas. Depending on dose, exact time window and duration of exposure, this may ultimately lead to the development of psychosis or schizophrenia. The proposed model provides testable hypotheses which can be addressed in future studies, including animal experiments, reanalysis of existing epidemiological data, and prospective epidemiological studies in which the role of the dose-time-effect relationship should be central.","Microglia are the main immune cells in the brain, playing a role in both physiological and pathological conditions. Microglial involvement in neurodegenerative diseases is well-established, being microglial activation and neuroinflammation common features of these neuropathologies. Microglial activation has been considered harmful for neurons, but inflammatory state is not only associated with neurotoxic consequences, but also with neuroprotective effects, such as phagocytosis of dead neurons and clearance of debris. This brought to the idea of protective autoimmunity in the brain and to devise immunomodulatory therapies, aimed to specifically increase neuroprotective aspects of microglia. During the last years, several data supported the intrinsic neuroprotective function of microglia through the release of neuroprotective molecules. These data led to change the traditional view of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases: from the idea that these cells play an detrimental role for neurons due to a gain of their inflammatory function, to the proposal of a loss of microglial neuroprotective function as a causing factor in neuropathologies. This ""microglial dysfunction hypothesis"" points at the importance of understanding the mechanisms of microglial-mediated neuroprotection to develop new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro models are very important to clarify the basic mechanisms of microglial-mediated neuroprotection, mainly for the identification of potentially effective neuroprotective molecules, and to design new approaches in a gene therapy set-up. Microglia could act as both a target and a vehicle for CNS gene delivery of neuroprotective factors, endogenously produced by microglia in physiological conditions, thus strengthening the microglial neuroprotective phenotype, even in a pathological situation.","Rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-(R)-aminoindan) is a novel, highly potent irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, anti-Parkinsonian drug. Rasagiline is effective as monotherapy or adjunct to L-Dopa for patients with early and late Parkinson's disease (PD). Its S-isomer, TVP1022 is thousand times less potent as an MAO-B inhibitor. However, both compounds have similar molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection in neuronal cell cultures and animal neurodegenerative models, indicating that the neuroprotective effect of rasagiline does not depend on inhibition of MAO-B, but rather is associated with the N-propargyl moiety, which promotes mitochondrial viability and stabilizes permeability transition by regulating Bcl-2 family proteins. Novel findings demonstrated that the major metabolite of rasagiline, 1-(R)-aminoindan has antioxidant and neuroprotective capabilities and thus, may contribute to the overt activity of its parent compound, rasagiline. This paper will review the earlier and present studies in the development of rasagiline for treatment of PD and discuss its pharmacology and applicable mechanism of action.","Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is still the most widely accepted animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Different types of EAE have been developed in order to investigate pathogenetic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of the heterogenic human disease. Generally, investigations in EAE are more suitable for the analysis of immunogenetic elements (major histocompatibility complex restriction and candidate risk genes) and for the study of histopathological features (inflammation, demyelination and degeneration) of the disease than for screening of new treatments. Recent studies in new EAE models, especially in transgenic ones, have in connection with new analytical techniques such as microarray assays provided a deeper insight into the pathogenic cellular and molecular mechanisms of EAE and potentially of MS. For example, it was possible to better delineate the role of soluble pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ and interleukins 1, 12 and 23), anti-inflammatory (transforming growth factor-β and interleukins 4, 10, 27 and 35) and neurotrophic factors (ciliary neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Also, the regulatory and effector functions of distinct immune cell subpopulations such as CD4+ Th1, Th2, Th3 and Th17 cells, CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells, CD8+ Tc1 and Tc2, B cells and γδ+ T cells have been disclosed in more detail. The new insights may help to identify novel targets for the treatment of MS. However, translation of the experimental results into the clinical practice requires prudence and great caution.","Delusions are the false and often incorrigible beliefs that can cause severe suffering in mental illness. We cannot yet explain them in terms of underlying neurobiological abnormalities. However, by drawing on recent advances in the biological, computational and psychological processes of reinforcement learning, memory, and perception it may be feasible to account for delusions in terms of cognition and brain function. The account focuses on a particular parameter, prediction error--the mismatch between expectation and experience--that provides a computational mechanism common to cortical hierarchies, fronto-striatal circuits and the amygdala as well as parietal cortices. We suggest that delusions result from aberrations in how brain circuits specify hierarchical predictions, and how they compute and respond to prediction errors. Defects in these fundamental brain mechanisms can vitiate perception, memory, bodily agency and social learning such that individuals with delusions experience an internal and external world that healthy individuals would find difficult to comprehend. The present model attempts to provide a framework through which we can build a mechanistic and translational understanding of these puzzling symptoms.","Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit varying and characteristic patterns of regional brain cell death, yet in each disorder there are distinct variations in the relative vulnerability of neurons within targeted brain regions. For example, in Parkinson's disease (PD) up to 90% of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta are lost at post-mortem, while as few as 25% of dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal tier of this nucleus succumb to the disease process. To date the reasons underlying differential vulnerability of similar neurons within a defined cytoarchitectural region has received little attention. We suggest variations in protein distribution underlies this differential vulnerability. Within the substantia nigra pars compacta the more vulnerable neurons exhibit an increased expression of factors that may contribute to vulnerability (D(2) dopamine autoreceptors, GIRK-2 potassium channels, lactotransferrin and the dopamine transporter) while also expressing a relative lack of neuroprotective elements (dopamine vesicle transport protein and a number of trophic and growth factors). Differential distribution of key proteins expressed by individual cells within the same cytoarchitectural brain region may influence the severity and likelihood of common neurodegenerative mechanisms, such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and thus the eventual fate of individual cells in the disease process. An understanding of how variable protein expression can influence cell survival within the diseased human brain in a range of neurodegenerative disorders may provide avenues for the development of novel strategies to improve the survival of targeted neurons in vivo.","More than 1 billion people around the world smoke, with 10 million cigarettes sold every minute. Cigarettes contain thousands of harmful chemicals including the psychoactive compound, nicotine. Nicotine addiction is initiated by the binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, ligand-gated cation channels activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. These receptors serve as prototypes for all ligand-gated ion channels and have been extensively studied in an attempt to elucidate their role in nicotine addiction. Many of these studies have focused on heteromeric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α4 and β2 subunits and homomeric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing the α7 subunit, two of the most abundant subtypes expressed in the brain. Recently however, a series of linkage analyses, candidate-gene analyses and genome-wide association studies have brought attention to three other members of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family: the α5, α3 and β4 subunits. The genes encoding these subunits lie in a genomic cluster that contains variants associated with increased risk for several diseases including nicotine dependence and lung cancer. The underlying mechanisms for these associations have not yet been elucidated but decades of research on the nicotinic receptor gene family as well as emerging data provide insight on how these receptors may function in pathological states. Here, we review this body of work, focusing on the clustered nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes and evaluating their role in nicotine addiction and lung cancer.","Emerging evidence indicates that heat shock proteins (HSPs) are critical regulators in normal neural physiological function as well as in cell stress responses. The functions of HSPs represent an enormous and diverse range of cellular activities, far beyond the originally identified roles in protein folding and chaperoning. HSPs are now understood to be involved in processes such as synaptic transmission, autophagy, ER stress response, protein kinase and cell death signaling. In addition, manipulation of HSPs has robust effects on the fate of cells in neurological injury and disease states. The ongoing exploration of multiple HSP superfamilies has underscored the pluripotent nature of HSPs in the cellular context, and has demanded the recent revamping of the nomenclature referring to these families to reflect a re-organization based on structure and function. In keeping with this re-organization, we first discuss the HSP superfamilies in terms of protein structure, regulation, expression and distribution in the brain. We then explore major cellular functions of HSPs that are relevant to neural physiological states, and from there we discuss known and proposed HSP impacts on major neurological disease states. This review article presents a three-part discussion on the array of HSP families relevant to neuronal tissue, their cellular functions, and the exploration of therapeutic targets of these proteins in the context of neurological diseases.","The cross-talk between receptors represents an important mechanism of neurotransmission modulation and plasticity. It can occur by direct physical interactions as in the case of G protein-coupled receptor heterodimerization, or it may involve intracellular pathways. The facilitatory or inhibitory action of one receptor might therefore depend on the function of the other receptors coexisting on the neuron. Recent studies have shown that this phenomenon also concerns the nicotinic receptor subtypes. This review will focus on the coexistence and the functional interaction between the release regulating presynaptic nAChR and other receptors coexisting on the same axon terminals. Presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the Central Nervous System may interact with other metabotropic or ionotropic receptors producing an integrated response which, in turn, generates antagonistic or synergistic effects. The understanding of these interactions may allow a better evaluation not only of the pharmacological effects of nicotine, but also of the normal physiological role of the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder and leading cause of disability worldwide. It is associated with increased mortality, especially from suicide. Heritability of MDD is estimated around 40%, suggesting that genotyping is a promising field for research into the development of MDD. According to the dopamine theory of affective disorders, a deficiency in dopaminergic neurotransmission may play a role in the major symptoms of MDD. Specific polymorphisms in genes that affect dopamine transmission could increase susceptibility to MDD. To determine the extent to which these genes influence vulnerability to MDD, we discuss genes for crucial steps in dopamine neurotransmission: synthesis, signalling and inactivation. The val158met polymorphism of the COMT gene exemplifies the lack of consensus in the literature: although it is one of the most reported polymorphisms that relates to MDD vulnerability, its role is not corroborated by meta-analysis. Gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions provide more explanatory potential than single gene associations. Two notable exceptions are the DRD4 and DAT gene: both have variable tandem repeat polymorphisms which may have a ""single gene"" influence on susceptibility to MDD.","Bee venom injection as a therapy, like many other complementary and alternative medicine approaches, has been used for thousands of years to attempt to alleviate a range of diseases including arthritis. More recently, additional theraupeutic goals have been added to the list of diseases making this a critical time to evaluate the evidence for the beneficial and adverse effects of bee venom injection. Although reports of pain reduction (analgesic and antinociceptive) and anti-inflammatory effects of bee venom injection are accumulating in the literature, it is common knowledge that bee venom stings are painful and produce inflammation. In addition, a significant number of studies have been performed in the past decade highlighting that injection of bee venom and components of bee venom produce significant signs of pain or nociception, inflammation and many effects at multiple levels of immediate, acute and prolonged pain processes. This report reviews the extensive new data regarding the deleterious effects of bee venom injection in people and animals, our current understanding of the responsible underlying mechanisms and critical venom components, and provides a critical evaluation of reports of the beneficial effects of bee venom injection in people and animals and the proposed underlying mechanisms. Although further studies are required to make firm conclusions, therapeutic bee venom injection may be beneficial for some patients, but may also be harmful. This report highlights key patterns of results, critical shortcomings, and essential areas requiring further study.","We conducted a systematic review and meta-regression analysis to quantify effects of exercise on brain hemodynamics measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The results indicate that acute incremental exercise (categorized relative to aerobic capacity (VO(2)peak) as low - <30% VO(2)peak; moderate - ≥30% VO(2)peak to <60% VO(2)peak; hard - ≥60% VO(2)peak to <VO(2)peak; and very hard - ≥VO(2)peak intensities) performed by 291 healthy people in 21 studies is accompanied by moderate-to-large increases (mean effect, dz±95% CI) in the prefrontal cortex of oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) or other measures of oxygen level (O(2)Hbdiff) or saturation (SCO(2)) (0.92±0.67, 1.17), deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) (0.87±0.56, 1.19), and blood volume estimated by total hemoglobin (tHb) (1.21±0.84, 1.59). After peaking at hard intensities, cerebral oxygen levels dropped during very hard intensities. People who were aerobically trained attained higher levels of cortical oxygen, dHb, and tHb than untrained people during very hard intensities. Among untrained people, a marked drop in oxygen levels and a small increase in dHb at very hard intensities accompanied declines in tHb, implying reduced blood flow. In 6 studies of 222 patients with heart or lung conditions, oxygenation and dHb were lowered or unchanged during exercise compared to baseline. In conclusion, prefrontal oxygenation measured with NIRS in healthy people showed a quadratic response to incremental exercise, rising between moderate and hard intensities, then falling at very hard intensities. Training status influenced the responses. While methodological improvements in measures of brain oxygen are forthcoming, these results extend the evidence relevant to existing models of central limitations to maximal exercise.","Studies of neuropeptide and peptide hormone signaling are coming of age in Drosophila due to rapid developments in molecular genetics approaches that overcome the difficulties caused by the small size of the fly. In addition we have genome-wide information on genes involved in peptide signaling, and growing pools of peptidomics data. A large number of different neuropeptides has been identified in a huge variety of neuron types in different parts of the Drosophila nervous system and cells in other locations. This review addresses questions related to peptidergic signaling in the Drosophila nervous system, especially how peptides regulate physiology and behavior during development and in the mature fly. We first summarize novel findings on neuropeptide precursor genes, processed bioactive peptides and their cognate receptors. Thereafter we provide an overview of the physiological and behavioral roles of peptide signaling in Drosophila. These roles include regulation of development, growth, feeding, metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis, and longevity, as well as neuromodulation in learning and memory, olfaction and locomotor control. The substrate of this signaling is the peptide products of about 42 precursor genes expressed in different combinations in a variety of neuronal circuits or that act as circulating hormones. Approximately 45 G-protein-coupled peptide receptors are known in Drosophila and for most of these the ligands have been identified. Functions of some peptides are better understood than others, and much work remains to reveal the spectrum of roles neuropeptides and peptide hormones play in the daily life of a fly.","The equilibrium of metal ions is critical for many physiological functions, particularly in the central nervous system, where metals are essential for development and maintenance of enzymatic activities, mitochondrial function, myelination, neurotransmission as well as learning and memory. Due to their importance, cells have evolved complex machinery for controlling metal-ion homeostasis. However, disruption of these mechanisms, or absorption of detrimental metals with no known biological function, alter the ionic balance and can result in a disease state, including several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the complex structural and functional interactions of metal ions with the various intracellular and extracellular components of the central nervous system, under normal conditions and during neurodegeneration, is essential for the development of effective therapies. Accordingly, assisting the balance of metal ions back to homeostatic levels has been proposed as a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.","The subventricular zone (SVZ) is a dynamic cellular niche with unique neurogenic properties that are, as of yet, not fully understood. Astrocytes residing in the SVZ have been shown to spawn migratory neuroblasts via transitory amplifying progenitor cells. These migratory neuroblasts play a role in maintaining the olfactory circuitry in healthy brains and potentially have restorative properties after brain injury. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the basic nature of these neurogenic astrocytes in order to gain a more cohesive picture of SVZ adult neurogenesis. However, one of the obstacles in this line of research is to specifically genetically modify SVZ astrocytes. Viral vector systems, based on adeno-associated viruses and lentiviruses, are flexible gene transfer systems that allow long-term transgene expression in a host cell. Electroporation allows for the transient expression of larger transgenes; whereas the cre/loxP system provides a lifetime of inherently stable genetic modulation. The benefits and drawbacks of these transduction methods and the application of various astrocyte-specific promoters are discussed with regard to their efficiency and accuracy when transducing adult SVZ astrocytes in the mouse brain. In vivo studies that manipulate gene expression in SVZ astrocytes will be essential to fully dissect and understand the complex molecular and cellular properties of the SVZ in the upcoming years.","Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) which contain glial cells and somas of primary sensory neurons are pivotal for neural transmission between the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is well established that neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide located in DRG neurons control sensory and pain mechanisms. However, contrary to the brain and spinal cord which are extensively investigated, DRG received little attention. Therefore, the current knowledge on DRG may be far to represent their complete neurochemical potential. For instance, until 1997, nothing was known on DRG neurosteroidogenic ability but recently, several investigations have shown that DRG contain various key enzymes synthesizing neuroactive neurosteroids. To provide new advances into DRG neurochemistry, we reviewed and highlighted herein basic and functional evidence showing that neurosteroids are produced in DRG through a neuron-glia crosstalk mechanism. Indeed, key enzymes producing neurosteroids including pregnenolone, progesterone, dihydroprogesterone and estradiol are differentially expressed in DRG cell types. Cytochrome P450side-chain-cleavage is located in DRG neurons and satellite glial cells, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is expressed in Schwann cells and neurons, 5alpha-reductase is localized in satellite glial and Schwann cells (not in neurons) while aromatase is present in neurons but not in glia. Recent studies also revealed that DRG neurosteroidogenesis is a physiologically relevant process selectively regulated under pathological conditions. Acting through paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, endogenous neurosteroids modulate DRG sensory functions and protect DRG neurons against death. The paper suggests that DRG neurosteroidogenic components may be targeted for the development of therapies against peripheral nerve injury-induced afferent noxious stimulations.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading neurodegenerative cause of dementia in the elderly. Thus far, there is no curative treatment for this devastating condition, thereby creating significant social and medical burdens. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline along with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and psychosis. Depression is a common psychiatric disorder affecting individuals across the life span. Although the ""monoamine hypothesis"" of depression has long been proposed, the pathologies and mechanisms for depressive disorders remain only partially understood. Pharmacotherapies targeting the monoaminergic pathways have been the mainstay in treating depression. Additional therapeutic approaches focusing other pathological mechanisms of depression are currently being explored. Interestingly, a number of proposed mechanisms for depression appear to be similar to those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. For example, diminishing neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammation observed in depression are found to be associated with the development of AD. This article first provides a concise review of AD and depression, then discusses the putative links between the two neuropsychiatric conditions.","Glycine is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem. It acts at glycine receptor (GlyR)-chloride channels, as well as a co-agonist of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In the hippocampus, the study of GlyRs has largely been under-appreciated due to the apparent absence of glycinergic synaptic transmission. Emerging evidence has shown the presence of extrasynaptic GlyRs in the hippocampus, which exert a tonic inhibitory role, and can be highly regulated under many pathophysiological conditions. On the other hand, besides d-serine, glycine has also been shown to modulate NMDAR function in the hippocampus. The simultaneous activation of excitatory NMDARs and inhibitory GlyRs may provide a homeostatic regulation of hippocampal network function. Furthermore, glycine can regulate hippocampal neuronal activity through GlyR-mediated cross-inhibition of GABAergic inhibition, or through the glycine binding site-dependent internalization of NMDARs. Therefore, hippocampal glycine and its receptors may operate in concert to finely regulate hippocampus-dependent high brain function such as learning and memory. Finally, dysfunction of hippocampal glycine signaling is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We speculate that further studies of hippocampal glycine-mediated regulation may help develop novel glycine-based approaches for therapeutic developments.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2011 Apr;93(4):549.,"Reelin is a conserved extracellular glycoprotein crucial for neurodevelopment. In adulthood, Reelin is an important modulator of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, required for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Consequently, abnormal Reelin-mediated signaling has been associated with many human brain disorders involving directly or indirectly altered NMDA receptor function. For most neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, abnormalities during brain development appear central in the disease etiology. However, a similar causative relationship for neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD), has not been investigated yet. The findings reviewed here center around the hypothesis that dysfunctional Reelin-mediated signaling converges overlapping molecular pathogenic pathways in schizophrenia and AD; highlighting a surprising interaction between prenatal inflammation and developmental abnormalities that appear to play a common role in aging-related neuropathology and cognitive decline. I hypothesize that the progression from normal aging to AD possibly results from late-gestational misregulations of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in immediate neuronal loss of Reelin-expressing neurons, facilitation of protein aggregation and concomitant impairments in proteolytical degradation during adulthood and aging, accompanied by chronic inflammation, expected to induce neurodegenerative processes. Conversely, a developmental immune challenge during mid-gestation, shown to preferentially mimic schizophrenia-like behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities, including impaired Reelin-mediated signaling, prevents progressive neurodegeneration, potentially linked to the immature embryonic immune system at the time of insult, which occludes long-term changes and sub-chronic elevations of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the findings presented in this review suggest that schizophrenia can indeed be described as a form of accelerated aging or ""dementia praecox"" as first described by Emil Kraepelin in 1906.","Obesity and related metabolic conditions are of epidemic proportions in most of the world, affecting both adults and children. The accumulation of lipids in the body in the form of white adipose tissue in the abdomen is now known to activate innate immune mechanisms. Lipid accumulation causes adipocytes to directly secrete the cytokines interleukin (IL) 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), but also monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), which results in the accumulation of leukocytes in fat tissue. This sets up a chronic inflammatory state which is known to mediate the association between obesity and conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. There is also a substantial literature linking inflammation with risk for depression. This includes the observations that: (1) people with inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and psoriasis have elevated rates of depression; (2) many people administered inflammatory cytokines such as interferon alpha develop depression that is indistinguishable from depression in non-medically ill populations; (3) a significant proportion of depressed persons show upregulation of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, and TNFalpha; (4) inflammatory cytokines can interact with virtually every pathophysiologic domain relevant to depression, including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and synaptic plasticity. While many factors may contribute to the association between inflammatory mediators and depression, we hypothesize that increased adiposity may be one causal pathway. Mediational analysis suggests a bi-directional association between adiposity and depression, with inflammation possibly playing an intermediary role.","The brainstem is a structurally complex region, containing numerous ascending and descending fibres that converge on centres that regulate bodily functions essential to life. Afferent input from the cranial tissues and the special senses is processed, in part, in brainstem nuclei. In addition, brainstem centres modulate the flow of pain messages and other forms of sensory information to higher regions of the brain, and influence the general excitability of these cortical regions. Thus, disruptions in brainstem processing might evoke a complex range of unpleasant symptoms, vegetative changes and neurovascular disturbances and that, together, form attacks of migraine. Migraine is linked with various co-morbid conditions, the most prominent being motion sickness. Symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and headache are common to motion sickness and migraine; moreover, migraine sufferers have a heightened vulnerability to motion sickness. As both maladies involve reflexes that relay in the brainstem, symptoms may share the same neural circuitry. In consequence, subclinical interictal persistence of disturbances in these brainstem pathways could not only increase vulnerability to recurrent attacks of migraine but also increase susceptibility to motion sickness. Mechanisms that mediate symptoms of motion sickness and migraine are explored in this paper. The physiology of motion sickness and migraine is discussed, and neurotransmitters that may be involved in the manifestation of symptoms are reviewed. Recent findings have shed light on the relationship between migraine and motion sickness, and provide insights into the generation of migraine attacks.","Infant survival and the development of secure and cooperative relationships are central to the future of the species. In humans, this relies heavily on the evolving early parent-infant social and affective relationship. While much is known about the behavioural and psychological components of this relationship, relatively little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomy. Affective and social neuroscience has helped to describe the main adult brain networks involved, but has so far engaged very little with developmental findings. In this review, we seek to highlight future avenues for research by providing a coherent framework for describing the parent-infant relationship over the first 18 months. We provide an outline of the evolving nature of the relationship, starting with basic orienting and recognition processes, and culminating in the infant's attainment of higher socio-emotional and cognitive capacities. Key social and affective interactions, such as communication, cooperative play and the establishment of specific attachments propel the development of the parent-infant relationship. We summarise our current knowledge of the developing infant brain in terms of structure and function, and how these relate to the emergent abilities necessary for the formation of a secure and cooperative relationship with parents or other caregivers. Important roles have been found for brain regions including the orbitofrontal, cingulate, and insular cortices in parent-infant interactions, but it has become clear that much more information is needed about the developmental time course and connectivity of these regions.","The cloning of K(Ca)2 channels revealed three subtypes, with each displaying distinct but partially overlapping expression distributions in the mammalian CNS and periphery. Activation of K(Ca)2 channels leads to membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of action potential firing. Block of K(Ca)2 channels has been suggested as a novel target for cognitive enhancement, depression, myotonic muscular dystrophy and heart arrhythmias. It is clear however, that blockers selective for individual K(Ca)2 channel subtypes would be required to be therapeutically useful. K(Ca)2 channel current is blocked by apamin, with the bee venom toxin being unusual in displaying some selectivity between K(Ca)2 channel subtypes. This suboptimal selectivity is not sufficient to be therapeutically useful and the toxin has been shown in vivo to have a very narrow therapeutic window. Mutational and molecular modelling studies of the K(Ca)2 channels are beginning to determine how selective block might be achieved. Mutagenesis has indicated the importance of the outer pore region and the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains S3 and S4 for block of K(Ca)2 current by apamin. Mapping the sequence of transmembrane domains S5, pore helix and S6 onto the crystal structures of KcsA, MthK and Kv1.2 has provided an approximation of the pore structure. This approach has allowed structural modelling of the interactions between toxins and channel, demonstrating that the toxins that show little discrimination between K(Ca)2 channel subtypes interact with the outer pore and around the K(+) selectivity filter. We present the structural modelling of the interaction of apamin and K(Ca)2.2, which is superimposed onto the crystal structure of Kv1.2. This has shown that apamin interacts only with the outer pore and does not come into contact with channel's selectivity filter. It is clear that by comparing how different toxins interact with each K(Ca)2 channel subtype, a detailed picture will be generated that will aid the development of more specific K(Ca)2 channel blockers.","This review addresses the ammonia fatigue theory in light of new evidence from exercise and disease studies and aims to provide a view of the role of ammonia during exercise. Hyperammonemia is a condition common to pathological liver disorders and intense or exhausting exercise. In pathology, hyperammonemia is linked to impairment of normal brain function and the onset of the neurological condition, hepatic encephalopathy. Elevated blood ammonia concentrations arise due to a diminished capacity for removal via the liver and lead to increased exposure of organs, such as the brain, to the toxic effects of ammonia. High levels of brain ammonia can lead to deleterious alterations in astrocyte morphology, cerebral energy metabolism and neurotransmission, which may in turn impact on the functioning of important signalling pathways within the neuron. Such changes are believed to contribute to the disturbances in neuropsychological function, in particular the learning, memory, and motor control deficits observed in animal models of liver disease and also patients with cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia in exercise occurs as a result of an increased production by contracting muscle, through adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deamination (the purine nucleotide cycle) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) deamination prior to oxidation. Plasma concentrations of ammonia during exercise often achieve or exceed those measured in liver disease patients, resulting in increased cerebral uptake. In this article we propose that exercise-induced hyperammonemia may lead to concomitant disturbances in brain function, potentially through similar mechanisms underpinning pathology, which may impact on performance as fatigue or reduced function, especially during extreme exercise.","Evidence accumulates for a key role of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in the many homeostatic and neuroprotective functions of astrocytes, including glycogen metabolism, regulation of immune responses, release of neurotrophic factors, and the astrogliosis that occurs in response to neuronal injury. A dysregulation of the astrocytic beta(2)-adrenergic-pathway is suspected to contribute to the physiopathology of a number of prevalent and devastating neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, stroke and hepatic encephalopathy. In this review we focus on the physiological functions of astrocytic beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, and their possible impact in disease states.","Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the most important endemic encephalitis in the world especially in Eastern and Southeastern Asia. JE affects over 50,000 patients and results in 15,000 deaths annually. JE virus is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus belonging to family flaviviridae. JE virus is transmitted through a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds. Humans are accidentally infected and are a dead end host because of low level and transient viremia. In the northern region, large epidemics occur during summers whereas in the southern region JE tends to be endemic: cases occur throughout the year with a peak in the rainy season. Occurrence of JE is more closely related to temperature than to humidity. JE is regarded as a disease of children in the endemic areas but in the newly invaded areas, it affects both the adults and children because of the absence of protective antibodies. For every patient of JE, there are large numbers of subclinical cases (25-1000). Symptomatic JEV infection manifests with nonspecific febrile illness, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Encephalitis manifests with altered sensorium, seizures and focal neurological deficit. Acute flaccid paralysis may occur due to anterior horn cell involvement. A wide variety of movement disorders especially transient Parkinsonian features and dystonia (limb, axial, orofacial) are reported in 20-60% patients. JE mainly affects thalamus, corpus striatum, brainstem and spinal cord as revealed by MRI and on autopsy studies. Coinfection of JE and cysticercosis occurs because of the important role of pigs in the life cycle of both JEV and cysticercosis. Laboratory diagnosis of JE is by IgM capture ELISA, which has high sensitivity and specificity. In the absence of specific antiviral therapy, JE is managed by symptomatic and supportive therapies and preventive measures. Purified formalin inactivated mouse brain derived vaccine and live attenuated vaccine (SA 14-14-2) are available; the latter is reported to be safe, effective and cheap. The role of Chimeric recombinant attenuated JE vaccine is under investigation. Control of JE is related to the wider issues of hygiene, environment, education and economy.","Cerebral malaria (CM) is still a major world health problem whose pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. After reviewing some particularities of anti-malarial immunity, we focus here on the neurovascular aspects of CM. We specifically address the central role of endothelial activation and alteration in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the respective roles of ""mediator-induced"" versus ""host cell-induced"" mechanisms of endothelial alteration. The former include cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, while the latter encompass cells located inside and outside the vessel, notably glial cells. We also present evidence for a pathogenic role for membrane microparticles (MP) in CM, based on studies in African patients and in a recognised mouse model. Intervention studies on MP production, via either gene knockout or pharmacological inhibition, can prevent the neurological syndrome and its associated mortality, suggesting potential new therapeutic avenues.","Taenia solium cysticercosis is still a major cause of seizures around the world. Despite an extensive body of published literature on this topic, knowledge of the biology, immunology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this parasite remains largely incomplete. This review summarizes recent information on the biology, clinical manifestations, immunopathology treatment and control of this important and neglected zoonotic disease, with emphasis on areas where recent developments have changed traditional and established views.","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes an acute symptomatic illness with fever, skin rash, and incapacitating arthralgia, which can evolve into chronic rheumatoid arthritis in elderly patients. This is a tropical disease originally described in central/east Africa in the 1960s, but its 2004 re-emergence in Africa and rapid spread in lands in and around the Indian Ocean (Reunion island, India, Malaysia) as well as Europe (Italy) led to almost 6 million cases worldwide. The risk of importation and spreading diseases with long-term sequelae is even greater today given the global distribution of the vectors (including in the Americas), increased tourism and the apparent capacity of CHIKV to produce high levels of viremia (10(9)-10(12) virus/ml of blood) and new mutants. CHIKV-associated neuropathology was described early in the 1960s, but it is the unprecedented incidence rate in Indian Ocean areas with efficient clinical facilities that allowed a better description of cases with severe encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, peripheral neuropathies and deaths among newborns (mother-to-child infection), infants and elderly patients. Death rates following CHIKV infection were estimated at 1:1000 cases in la Reunion's outbreak. These clinical observations have been corroborated by experimental infection in several mouse models, leading to CNS pathologies. We further describe in this review the capacity of CHIKV to infect neurons and glial cells, delineate the fundamental innate (intrinsic) immune defence mechanisms to protect from infection and argue about the possible mechanisms involved in the encephalopathy.","The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. A few bacterial pathogens are able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans, a rare but dreadful disease. Surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae). The particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-CSF barrier. In vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. agalactiae to reach the CSF. N. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. Adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type IV pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. Recent work has shown that N. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex Par3/Par6/aPKC that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.", ,"Multiple signaling pathways play key regulatory roles during the development of peripheral nervous system (PNS) and also in neuroregeneration process following nerve degeneration. Schwann cells, the glial cells of the PNS, by interacting with neuronal (axonal) ligands, mainly neuregulins via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) complex, ErbB2/ErbB3, initiate intracellular signaling pathways to drive proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells, both during development and the process of regeneration and re-myelination after nerve injury. One of the major signaling kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), that is also a downstream signaling pathway of neuregulin-ErbB2/ErbB3 activation, has been identified as a key regulator of Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, demyelination and nerve regeneration. Recent studies have provided evidence that the bacterium that causes human leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae that has a unique capacity to invade Schwann cells of the adult PNS, utilizes the neuregulin-ErbB2/ErbB3 associated signaling network to the bacterial advantage. M. leprae directly bind to ErbB2 on myelinated Schwann cells and activate the RTK by a novel route that bypasses the classical neuregulin/growth factor-induced ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization, and subsequently induce downstream the canonical Erk1/2 signaling, leading to myelin breakdown and subsequent axonal damage. This initial injury provides a survival advantage for M. leprae as it induces de-differentiation and generates myelin-free cells, which are highly susceptible to M. leprae invasion and promote bacterial survival. Once invaded M. leprae activate Erk1/2 via a non-canonical pathway and subsequently increase the cell proliferation and maintain the infected cells in de-differentiated state, thereby preventing remyelination. Therefore, by subverting major RTKs and signaling pathways in adult Schwann cells M. leprae appear to propagate the bacterial niche and maintain survival within the PNS. These studies may also provide new insights into our understanding of signaling mechanisms involve in both neurodegeneration and neuroregeneration.","Neurologic disease is a major cause of disability in resource-poor countries and a substantial portion of this disease is due to infections of the CNS. A wide variety of emerging and re-emerging viruses contribute to this disease burden. New emerging infections are commonly due to RNA viruses that have expanded their geographic range, spread from animal reservoirs or acquired new neurovirulence properties. Mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Chikungunya virus. Zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus. Viruses adapt to new hosts, or to cause more severe disease, by changing their genomes through reassortment (e.g. influenza virus), mutation (essentially all RNA viruses) and recombination (e.g. vaccine strains of poliovirus). Viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include West Nile virus, enterovirus 71 and possibly Chikungunya virus. In addition to these newer challenges, rabies, polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control. Control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination. Poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication. Measles elimination depends on delivery of two doses of live virus vaccine to a high enough proportion of the population to maintain herd immunity for this highly infectious virus.","The extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies and HAT occurs in foci in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease, which is invariably lethal if untreated, evolves in a first hemo-lymphatic stage, progressing to a second meningo-encephalitic stage when the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier. At first, trypanosomes are restricted to circumventricular organs and choroid plexus in the brain outside the blood-brain barrier, and to dorsal root ganglia. Later, parasites cross the blood-brain barrier at post-capillary venules, through a multi-step process similar to that of lymphocytes. Accumulation of parasites in the brain is regulated by cytokines and chemokines. Trypanosomes can alter neuronal function and the most prominent manifestation is represented by sleep alterations. These are characterized, in HAT and experimental rodent infections, by disruption of the sleep-wake 24h cycle and internal sleep structure. Trypanosome infections alter also some, but not all, other endogenous biological rhythms. A number of neural pathways and molecules may be involved in such effects. Trypanosomes secrete prostaglandins including the somnogenic PGD2, and they interact with the host's immune system to cause release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. From the sites of early localization of parasites in the brain and meninges, such molecules could affect adjacent brain areas implicated in sleep-wakefulness regulation, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus and its downstream targets, to cause the changes characteristic of the disease. This raises challenging issues on the effects of cytokines on synaptic functions potentially involved in sleep-wakefulness alterations.","The HIV pandemic represents a major source of neurological morbidity worldwide. Emerging data from diverse populations indicate that HIV leads to significant neurocognitive impairments that reduce individuals' ability to contribute to the well being of their families and society. HIV affects vulnerable populations with many comorbidities, but the virus contributes to neurocognitive impairment independent of these conditions. The neuropathological substrate of HIV neurocognitive disorders is damage to synapses and dendrites, without major neuronal loss. This suggests the potential for substantial reversibility if synaptodendritic function can be restored. In the developed world, combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) leads to improved neurocognitive function as well as morbidity and mortality in HIV. CART is being used in increasing numbers of individuals in resource limited settings. New cases of severe dementia are now rare in populations where effective CART has been deployed. While some degree of neurocognitive improvement with CART is almost universal, many individuals do not achieve full restoration of their premorbid neurocognitive status, and milder degrees of impairment remain quite prevalent. Optimizing neurocognitive recovery is likely to require the development of better CNS penetrating antiretroviral regimens and the use of neuroprotective agents.","The diffuse chemosensory system (DCS) is an anatomical structure composed of solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs, also called solitary chemoreceptor cells), which have analogies with taste cells but are not aggregated in buds. The concept of DCS has been advanced, after the discovery that cells similar to gustatory elements are present in several organs. The elements forming the DCS share common morphological and biochemical characteristics with the taste cells located in taste buds of the oro-pharyngeal cavity but they are localized in internal organs. In particular, they may express molecules of the chemoreceptorial cascade (e.g. trans-membrane taste receptors, the G-protein alpha-gustducin, PLCbeta2, TRPM5). This article will focus on the mammalian DCS in apparatuses of endodermic origin (i.e. digestive and respiratory systems), which is composed of an enormous number of sensory elements and presents a multiplicity of morphological aspects. Recent research has provided an adequate description of these elements, but the functional role for the DCS in these apparatuses is unknown. The initial findings led to the definition of a DCS structured like an iceberg, with a mysterious ""submerged"" portion localized in the distal part of endodermic apparatuses. Recent work has focussed on the discovery of this submerged portion, which now appears less puzzling. However, the functional roles of the different cytotypes belonging to the DCS are not well known. Recent studies linked chemosensation of the intraluminal content to local control of absorptive and secretory (exocrine and endocrine) processes. Control of the microbial population and detection of irritants seem to be other possible functions of the DCS. In the light of these new findings, the DCS might be thought to be involved in a wide range of diseases of both the respiratory (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis) and digestive apparatuses (absorptive or secretive diseases, dysmicrobism), as well as in systemic diseases (e.g. obesity, diabetes). A description of the functional roles of the DCS might be a first step toward the discovery of therapeutic approaches which target chemosensory mechanisms.","Brain damage can sometimes render a patient persistently unresponsive and yet apparently awake, admitting the possibility that the absence of overt voluntary behaviour might conceal a retained capacity for covert cognition. When given instructions to perform a cognitive task, a minority of patients in such a so-called persistent vegetative state (PVS) has recently been found to exhibit patterns of brain activation closely matching those observed in normal subjects obeying the same instructions. These data have been widely interpreted as implying the detection of covert ""consciousness"". Here we show that this inference is not supported by the extant data because it relies on critical assumptions, obscured by conceptual unclarities, that are either untested or untestable. We set out the proper grounds for ascribing psychological attributes to PVS patients from physiological evidence of any kind, and offer a perspicuous conceptual framework for future empirical studies in the field.","When an individual is learning a new skill, recovering from a brain damage, or participating in an intervention program, plastic changes take place in the brain. However, brain plasticity, intensively studied in animals, is not readily accessible in humans to whom invasive research methods cannot be applied without valid clinical or therapeutic reasons. Animal models, in turn, do not provide information about higher mental functions like language or music. Evoked neural responses have shed new light to the mechanisms underlying learning and recovery, however. Of particular interest are those higher order neural responses that can be recorded even with absence of attention, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN) and N1. They enable one to determine plastic neural changes even in patients who are unable to communicate and in infants learning a language.","Noxious stimuli can usually cause the aversive sensations, pain and itch. The initial integration of such noxious information occurs in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord (SDH), which is very important for understanding pain sensation and developing effective analgesic strategies. The circuits formed by pools of neurons and terminals within SDH are accepted as the platform for such complicated integrations and are highly plastic under conditions of inflammatory or neuropathic pain. Recent literature offers a complicated, yet versatile view of SDH intrinsic circuits with both inhibitory and excitatory components. However, our knowledge about the adaptative regulation of SDH local circuits is still far from sufficient due to the incomplete understanding of their organization as they are intermingled with primary afferent fibers (PAFs), poorly understood or identified SDH neurons, somehow contradictory data for descending control systems. A more positive view emphasizes abundant modern data on SDH neuron morphology and physiology riding on the back of significant technological advancements used in neuroscience. Reviewing the current literature on this topic thus produced an integrated understanding of SDH neurons and the SDH local circuits involved in noxious transmission and modulation.","Various combinations of subunits assemble to form the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), generating diversity in its functions. Here we review roles of the unique NMDAR subunit, NR3A, which acts in a dominant-negative manner to suppress receptor activity. NR3A-containing NMDARs display striking regional and temporal expression specificity, and, unlike most other NMDAR subtypes, they have a low conductance, are only modestly permeable to Ca(2+), and pass current at hyperpolarized potentials in the presence of magnesium. While glutamate activates triheteromeric NMDARs composed of NR1/NR2/NR3A subunits, glycine is sufficient to activate diheteromeric NR1/NR3A-containing receptors. NR3A dysfunction may contribute to neurological disorders involving NMDARs, and the subunit offers an attractive therapeutic target given its distinct pharmacological and structural properties.","Down syndrome (DS) is the leading cause of genetically-defined intellectual disability and congenital birth defects. Despite being one of the first genetic diseases identified, only recently, thanks to the phenotypic analysis of DS mouse genetic models, we have begun to understand how trisomy may impact cognitive function. Cognitive disabilities in DS appear to result mainly from two pathological processes: neurogenesis impairment and Alzheimer-like degeneration. In DS brain, suboptimal network architecture and altered synaptic communication arising from neurodevelopmental impairment are key determinants of cognitive defects. Hypocellularity and hypoplasia start at early developmental stages and likely depend upon impaired proliferation of neuronal precursors, resulting in reduction of numbers of neurons and synaptic contacts. The impairment of neuronal precursor proliferation extends to adult neurogenesis and may affect learning and memory. Neurodegenerative mechanisms also contribute to DS cognitive impairment. Early onset Alzheimer disease occurs with extremely high incidence in DS patients and is causally-related to overexpression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), which is one of the triplicated genes in DS. In this review, we will survey the available findings on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative changes occurring in DS throughout life. Moreover, we will discuss the potential mechanisms by which defects in neurogenesis and neurodegenerative processes lead to altered formation of neural circuits and impair cognitive function, in connection with findings on pharmacological treatments of potential benefit for DS.","This review annotates and categorises the glia of adult Drosophila and other model insects and analyses the developmental origins of these in the Drosophila optic lobe. The functions of glia in the adult vary depending upon their sub-type and location in the brain. The task of annotating glia is essentially complete only for the glia of the fly's lamina, which comprise: two types of surface glia-the pseudocartridge and fenestrated glia; two types of cortex glia-the distal and proximal satellite glia; and two types of neuropile glia-the epithelial and marginal glia. We advocate that the term subretinal glia, as used to refer to both pseudocartridge and fenestrated glia, be abandoned. Other neuropiles contain similar glial subtypes, but other than the antennal lobes these have not been described in detail. Surface glia form the blood brain barrier, regulating the flow of substances into and out of the nervous system, both for the brain as a whole and the optic neuropiles in particular. Cortex glia provide a second level of barrier, wrapping axon fascicles and isolating neuronal cell bodies both from neighbouring brain regions and from their underlying neuropiles. Neuropile glia can be generated in the adult and a subtype, ensheathing glia, are responsible for cleaning up cellular debris during Wallerian degeneration. Both the neuropile ensheathing and astrocyte-like glia may be involved in clearing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, thus modifying the levels of histamine, glutamate and possibly dopamine at the synapse to ultimately affect behaviour.","With the aging of the population, the growing incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases the burden on individuals and society as a whole. To date, the pathophysiology of AD is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may play a pivotal role in its course and development. The most frequently studied epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone modifications, and investigations relevant to aging and AD are presented in this review. Various studies on human postmortem brain samples and peripheral leukocytes, as well as transgenic animal models and cell culture studies relevant to AD will be discussed. From those, it is clear that aging and AD are associated with epigenetic dysregulation at various levels. Moreover, data on e.g. twin studies in AD support the notion that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the risk for AD. Conversely, it is still not fully clear whether the observed epigenetic changes actually represent a cause or a consequence of the disease. This is mainly due to the fact that most clinical investigations on epigenetics in AD are conducted in samples of patients already in an advanced stage of the disease. Evidently, more research is needed in order to clarify the exact role of epigenetic regulation in the course and development of AD. Research on earlier stages of the disease could provide more insight into its underlying pathophysiology, possibly contributing to the establishment of early diagnosis and the development of more effective treatment strategies.","Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system are extremely vulnerable to oxygen deprivation and blood supply insufficiency. Indeed, hypoxic/ischemic stress triggers multiple pathophysiological changes in the brain, forming the basis of hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. One of the initial and crucial events induced by hypoxia/ischemia is the disruption of ionic homeostasis characterized by enhanced K(+) efflux and Na(+)-, Ca(2+)- and Cl(-)-influx, which causes neuronal injury or even death. Recent data from our laboratory and those of others have shown that activation of opioid receptors, particularly delta-opioid receptors (DOR), is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic insult. This protective mechanism may be one of the key factors that determine neuronal survival under hypoxic/ischemic condition. An important aspect of the DOR-mediated neuroprotection is its action against hypoxic/ischemic disruption of ionic homeostasis. Specially, DOR signal inhibits Na(+) influx through the membrane and reduces the increase in intracellular Ca(2+), thus decreasing the excessive leakage of intracellular K(+). Such protection is dependent on a PKC-dependent and PKA-independent signaling pathway. Furthermore, our novel exploration shows that DOR attenuates hypoxic/ischemic disruption of ionic homeostasis through the inhibitory regulation of Na(+) channels. In this review, we will first update current information regarding the process and features of hypoxic/ischemic disruption of ionic homeostasis and then discuss the opioid-mediated regulation of ionic homeostasis, especially in hypoxic/ischemic condition, and the underlying mechanisms.","After 40 years of investigation, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) have been shown to be useful for many paradigms in cognitive (visual attention, binocular rivalry, working memory, and brain rhythms) and clinical neuroscience (aging, neurodegenerative disorders, schizophrenia, ophthalmic pathologies, migraine, autism, depression, anxiety, stress, and epilepsy). Recently, in engineering, SSVEPs found a novel application for SSVEP-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Although some SSVEP properties are well documented, many questions are still hotly debated. We provide an overview of recent SSVEP studies in neuroscience (using implanted and scalp EEG, fMRI, or PET), with the perspective of modern theories about the visual pathway. We investigate the steady-state evoked activity, its properties, and the mechanisms behind SSVEP generation. Next, we describe the SSVEP-BCI paradigm and review recently developed SSVEP-based BCI systems. Lastly, we outline future research directions related to basic and applied aspects of SSVEPs.","The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex, putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.","Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), historically referred to as Microcephalia vera, is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Patients with MCPH typically exhibit congenital microcephaly as well as mental retardation, but usually no further neurological findings or malformations. Their microcephaly with grossly preserved macroscopic organization of the brain is a consequence of a reduced brain volume, which is evident particularly within the cerebral cortex and thus results to a large part from a reduction of grey matter. Some patients with MCPH further provide evidence of neuronal heterotopias, polymicrogyria or cortical dysplasia suggesting an associated neuronal migration defect. Genetic causes of MCPH subtypes 1-7 include mutations in genes encoding microcephalin, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory associated protein 2 (CDK5RAP2), abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly associated protein (ASPM), centromeric protein J (CENPJ), and SCL/TAL1-interrupting locus (STIL) as well as linkage to the two loci 19q13.1-13.2 and 15q15-q21. Here, we provide a timely overview of current knowledge on mechanisms leading to microcephaly in humans with MCPH and abnormalities in cell division/cell survival in corresponding animal models. Understanding the pathomechanisms leading to MCPH is of high importance not only for our understanding of physiologic brain development (particularly of cortex formation), but also for that of trends in mammalian evolution with a massive increase in size of the cerebral cortex in primates, of microcephalies of other etiologies including environmentally induced microcephalies, and of cancer formation.","UCHL1/PGP 9.5 (also known as UCHL1 and PGP 9.5) was first detected as a ""brain-specific protein"" over 28 years ago. The protein is highly conserved and localized in neurones and neuroendocrine cells in vertebrates, forming an estimated 5-10% of cytoplasmic protein. A minor proportion in brain is tightly membrane-bound and the protein is also found in human oocytes and spermatogonia. A few specialised neurones lack UCHL1/PGP 9.5 and possibly replaceable neurones have low levels of the protein. UCHL1/PGP 9.5 shows sequence homology with UCHL3 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L3) and will similarly hydrolyse C-terminal adducts of ubiquitin. Both proteins show an unusual highly knotted structure with five ""crossovers"" but there are differences in substrate specificity, amino-acid sequence, and tissue distribution between them. There is no convincing evidence that UCHL1/PGP 9.5 can remove ubiquitin from proteins destined for proteasomal degradation, rather the substrate(s) of the enzyme appear to be one or more as yet unidentified short ubiquitin C-terminal extensions. Other suggested functions of the protein are plausible but largely unconfirmed. Isolated loss of UCHL1/PGP 9.5 function seen in the gracile axonal dystrophy (GAD) mouse due to a deletion in its gene results in a failure of axonal transport and a ""dying-back"" axonopathy beginning distally in long axons. The evidence that mutations in the UCHL1/PGP 9.5 gene lead to either significant susceptibility to or protection from Parkinson's disease (or other human neurodegenerative disorders) is weak. Antibodies to the protein have found remarkably widespread application in the detection of fine nerves in peripheral tissues of many vertebrate species.","Human epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence that the risk of developing schizophrenia is significantly enhanced following prenatal and/or perinatal exposure to various environmental insults, including maternal exposure to stress, infection and/or immune activation, nutritional deficiencies and obstetric complications. Based on these associations, a great deal of interest has been centered upon the establishment of neurodevelopmental animal models which are based on prenatal and/or perinatal exposure to such environmental stimuli. In the present review, we describe this relatively novel class of epidemiology-based animal models in relation to the etiology, neurobiology and psychopharmacology of schizophrenia. Thereby, we discuss the general design and practical implementation of these models, and we provide an integrative summary of experimental findings derived from diverse epidemiology-based models, including models of maternal exposure to psychological stress, glucocorticoid treatment, viral infection, immune activating agents, protein deprivation, vitamin D deficiency, as well as models of obstetric complications in the form of birth by Caesarian section and perinatal/postnatal hypoxia. We highlight that the long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to these environmental challenges in animals successfully capture a broad spectrum of structural and functional brain abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia, some of which can be normalized by acute and/or chronic antipsychotic drug treatment. We thus conclude that epidemiology-driven neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia are characterized by a high level of face, construct and predictive validity, including intrinsic etiological significance to the disorder. They also fulfill the expectation of the neurodevelopmental theory, such that the effects of prenatal environmental insults often only emerge after puberty. Epidemiologically based animal models not only provide indispensable experimental tools to test the hypothesis of causality in human epidemiological associations, but they also offer important new avenues for the elucidation of neurobiological, neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological mechanisms involved in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia and related disorders.","The detailed anatomy of the monoamine pathways of the rat by the students of Nils-Ake Hillarp provided the basis for a neurocircuitry targeting pharmacology. Further progress was achieved by the introduction of 6-hydroxydopamine as a tool for performing specific lesions, leading to the first stereotaxic mapping of the monoamine pathways in the rat brain by Urban Ungerstedt at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Unilateral intracerebral injections with 6-hydroxydopamine led to the proposal of 'Rotational Behaviour', as a classical model for screening drugs useful for alleviating Parkinson's disease and other neuropathologies. The direction of the rotational behaviour induced by drugs administrated to lesioned rats reveals their mechanisms of action on dopamine synapses, as demonstrated when rotational behaviour was combined with microdialysis. The model was useful for proposing a role of dopamine receptors in the gating of the flow of information through different efferent pathways of the basal ganglia. It is established now that the coupling of dopamine receptors is regulated by a number of proteins acting as GTPases, the regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) family. More than 20 RGS proteins have been identified, organised into subfamilies based on structural features and specificity for different G-protein subunits. These protein subfamilies represent alternative pathways gating the flow of information generated in the basal ganglia. Microdialysis has been developed as a general tool for studying tissue and organ chemistry, leading to a truly translational venture as microdialysis is brought into clinical use, monitoring energy metabolism following global or focal ischemia in the neurosurgery and general medicine scenario.","The review describes the initial experiments suggesting a fast intra-axonal transport of transmitter related substances, in addition to the ""classic"" slow flow. Early experiments were mainly conducted in the peripheral adrenergic system, focusing on transport of amine storage granules, the extent of the vast sympathetic adrenergic system and the importance of axonal transport of amine granules for the adrenergic system. Further, it describes important advances obtained from studies of other neuron systems regarding local axonal protein synthesis, motor proteins and new insights regarding relation between faults in the transport machinery and some neuropathological conditions.","Parkinson's disease was long considered a non-hereditary disorder. Despite extensive research trying to find environmental risk factors for the disease, genetic variants now stand out as the major causative factor. Since a number of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis it seems likely that several molecular pathways and downstream effectors can affect the trophic support and/or the survival of dopamine neurons, subsequently leading to Parkinson's disease. The present review describes how toxin-based animal models have been valuable tools in trying to find the underlying mechanisms of disease, and how identification of disease-linked genes in humans has led to the development of new transgenic rodent models. The review also describes the current status of the most common genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease identified up to today.","There are two major secretory pathways in neurons, the regulated pathway and the constitutive pathway. Neuropeptides and other regulated secretory proteins are known to be sorted into large dense-core vesicles of the regulated pathway in the trans-Golgi network and are secreted upon stimulus-induced increases in intracellular Ca(2+). The newly synthesized cell surface receptors are usually sorted into microvesicles of the constitutive pathway and inserted into the plasma membrane by spontaneous exocytosis. Small-diameter sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia and pheochromocytoma cells express neuropeptides (e.g., substance P) and several neuropeptide receptors including opioid receptors. The mu-opioid receptors are delivered to the cell surface through the constitutive pathway, whereas another type of opioid receptor, the delta-opioid receptor, is often found in the membrane of large dense-core vesicles and can be inserted into the plasma membrane when exocytosis occurs. Recent studies show that sequences with opposite electrical polarity within the prohormones of substance P are essential for their sorting into large dense-core vesicles. Moreover, the delta-opioid receptor is sorted into large dense-core vesicles by its interaction with protachykinin, a prohormone of substance P. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that determine the sorting and trafficking of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors in neurons.","My goals for this perspective are to enumerate what I consider to have been the major discoveries in the investigations of the central catecholamine neuron systems from the synaptic, cellular and systems physiological and neurohistochemical perspectives. To do so, I will emphasize here the synaptic and physiological aspects of the central noradrenergic (NE) system, considering both the past research and what we may expect to witness in the decades ahead.","Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder which afflicts an increasing number of individuals. If the wider complex of extrapyramidal symptoms referred to as ""age-related parkinsonism"" is included, the incidence is near 50% of the population above 80 years of age. This review summarizes recent studies from our laboratories as well as other research groups in the quest to explore the multi-faceted etiology of age-related neurodegeneration, in general, and degeneration of the substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, in particular. Our work during recent years has focused on assessment of potential interactive effects of a reduction in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the aging process (intrinsic factors) and early neurotoxin exposure (an extrinsic factor) on dopamine (DA) systems and the behaviors they mediate. The guiding hypothesis directing the research to be described was that a combination of the two factors would exacerbate the decline in the DA transmitter system function that occurs during aging. The results obtained were consistent with the well-established aging-related decline in function and structure of neurons utilizing DA as a transmitter and motor function, and extended knowledge by establishing that the genetic reduction of Gdnf exacerbated these aging related changes. Thus, GDNF reduction appears to increase the vulnerability of the DA neurons to the many different challenges associated with the aging process. Assessment of methamphetamine effects on young Gdnf(+/-) mice indicated that reduced GDNF availability increased the vulnerability of DA systems to this well-established neurotoxin. The work discussed in this review is consistent with earlier work demonstrating the importance of GDNF for maintenance of DA neurons and also provides a novel model for progressive DA degeneration and motor dysfunction.","Nitric oxide was identified as a biological intercellular messenger just over 20 years ago, and its presence and potential importance in the nervous system was immediately noted. With the cloning of NO synthase and the physiological NO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase, a variety of histochemical methods quickly led to a rather complete picture of where NO is produced and acts in the nervous system. However, the details regarding the subcellular localization of NO synthase and the identity of its molecular binding partners require further clarification. Although the hypothesis that calcium influx via activation of NMDA receptors is a key trigger for NO production has proven very popular and led to suggested roles for NO in synaptic plasticity, there is little direct evidence to support this notion. Instead, studies from the peripheral nervous system indicate a key role for voltage-sensitive calcium channels in regulating NO synthase activity. A similar mechanism may also be important in central neurons, and it remains an important task to identify the precise sources of calcium regulating NO production in specific NO neurons. Also, although cGMP production appears to mediate the physiological signaling by NO, the specific roles of cGMP-dependent ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases in mediating NO action remain to be determined.","Cells in the nervous system can respond to different kinds of stress, e.g. injury, with production and release of inflammatory molecules, including cytokines. One of the most important proinflammatory cytokines is interleukin-1, affecting most organs of the body. The high constitutive expression of interleukin-1 in the adrenal gland provides a source for local and systemic actions, in addition to activated monocytes. In the brain, the constitutive expression is low, but activated microglia produce and release interleukin-1 during pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease). Interleukin-1 has an important role in mediating 'sickness symptoms' such as fever, in response to infections. Its role in neurodegeneration is not fully elucidated, but there is evidence for involvement in both amyloidosis and tau pathology, major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The interleukin-1 family at present consists of 11 members, one of which is the endogenous receptor antagonist. Overexpression of this antagonist in the CNS in a transgenic mouse strain, Tg hsIL-1ra, has allowed studies on morphological and functional effects of blocking interleukin-1 receptor-mediated activity in the brain. Marked alterations of brain morphology such as reduced hippocampal and cortical volume correlate with behavioural deficits. Decreased anxiety and impaired long-term memory are among the consequences. Intact interleukin-1 signalling is important for the brain's ability to adapt to acute and chronic neuroinflammation. Increased amplitude and prolongation of proinflammatory cytokine production underly the behavioural alterations characteristic for ageing. Moreover, deregulated expression of interleukin-1 is associated with ageing-related chronic neurodegenerative disorders.","Grafting of dopamine-rich tissue to counteract the symptoms in Parkinson's disease became a promising tool for future treatment. This article discusses how to improve the functional outcome with respect to graft outgrowth and functions of dopamine release and electrophysiological responses to graft implantation in the host brain striatal target. It has been documented that a subpopulation of the dopamine neurons innervates the host brain in a target-specific manner, while some of the grafted dopamine neurons never project to the host striatum. Neurochemical studies have demonstrated that the graft-induced outgrowth synthesize, store, metabolize and release dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters such as 5-HT. Furthermore, the released dopamine affects the dopamine-depleted brain in areas that are larger than the graft-derived nerve fibers reach. While stem cells will most likely be the future source of cells to be used in grafting, it is important to find the guiding cues for how to reinnervate the dopamine-depleted striatum in a proper way with respect to the dopamine subpopulations of A9 and A10 to efficiently treat the motor abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease.","This review article covers the early period of my career. I first summarize research initiated by the late Nils-Ake Hillarp, after his appointment in 1962 as professor in the Department of Histology at Karolinska Institutet. He only lived for three more years, but during this short period he started up a group of ten students who explored various aspects of the three monoamine transmitters, dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, using the new formaldehyde fluorescence method developed by Bengt Falck and Hillarp in Lund. This method allowed visualization of the cellular localization in the microscope of these monoamines, which introduced a new discipline in neurobiology-chemical neuroanatomy. I then deal with work aiming at localizing the monoamines at the ultrastructural level, as well as attempts to use radioactively labeled aminoacids, especially gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and autoradiography, to identify, in the microscope, neurons using such transmitters. Finally, our immunohistochemical work together with Kjell Fuxe and the late Menek Goldstein, using antibodies to four monoamine-synthesizing enzymes is summarized, including some aspects on the adrenaline neurons, which had escaped detection with the Falck-Hillarp technique.","The dawn of chemical neuroanatomy in the CNS came with the discovery and mapping of the central dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons by means of transmitter histochemistry using the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde fluorescence technique in the early 1960s. Our mapping of the central monoamine neurons was continued and further established with tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in collaboration with Menek Goldstein and Tomas Hökfelt. During recent years an evolutionary constraint in the nuclear parcellation of the DA, NA and 5-HT neurons was demonstrated in the order Rodentia and other mammals. The abundant existence of global monoamine varicose nerve terminal networks synthesizing, storing and releasing monoamines in various parts of the CNS, including the release of DA by tubero-infundibular DA neurons as a prolactin inhibitory factor from the external layer of the median eminence into the portal vessels and the appearance of extraneuronal DA fluorescence after, e.g., treatment with amphetamine in nialamide pretreated rats (Falck-Hillarp technique) were also remarkable observations. These observations and others like the discovery of transmitter-receptor mismatches opened up the possibility that monoamines were modulating the wired brain, built up mainly by glutamate and GABA neurons, through diffusion and flow in the extracellular fluid of the extracellular space and in the CSF. This transmission also involved long-distance channels along myelinated fibers and blood vessels and was called volume transmission (VT). The extracellular space (ECS), filled with a 3D matrix, plays a fundamental role in this communication. Energy gradients for signal migration in the ECS are produced via concentration, temperature and pressure gradients, the latter two allowing a flow of the ECF and CSF carrying the VT signals. The differential properties of the wiring transmission (WT) and VT circuits and communication channels will be discussed as well as the role of neurosteroids and oxytocin receptors in volume transmission leading to a new understanding of the integrative actions of neuronal-glial networks. The role of tunneling nanotubes with mitochondrial transfer in CNS inter alia as part of neuron-glia interactions will also be introduced representing a novel type of wiring transmission. The impact of the technicolour approach to the connectome for the future characterization of the wired networks of the brain is emphasized.","Dopamine plays an important role in fear and anxiety modulating a cortical brake that the medial prefrontal cortex exerts on the anxiogenic output of the amygdala and have an important influence on the trafficking of impulses between the basolateral (BLA) and central nuclei (CeA) of amygdala. Dopamine afferents from the ventral tegmental area innervate preferentially the rostrolateral main and paracapsular intercalated islands as well as the lateral central nucleus of amygdala activating non-overlapping populations of D1- and D2-dopamine receptors located in these structures. Behaviorally, the intra-amygdaloid infusion of D1 agonists and antagonists elicits anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects respectively on conditioned and non-conditioned models of fear/anxiety suggesting an anxiogenic role for D1 receptors in amygdala. The analysis of the effects of D2 agonists and antagonists suggest that depending of the nature of the threat the animal experiences in anxiety models either anxiogenic or anxiolytic effects are elicited. It is suggested that D1- and D2-dopamine receptors in the amygdala may have a differential role in the modulation of anxiety. The possibility is discussed that D1 receptors participate in danger recognition facilitating conditioned-unconditioned associations by the retrieval of the affective properties of the unconditioned stimuli, and in the control of impulse trafficking from cortical and BLA regions to BLA and CeA nuclei respectively whereas D2 receptors have a role in setting up adaptive responses to cope with aversive environmental stimuli.","The hippocampal formation plays a critical role in cognitive function. The developmental events that shape the hippocampal formation are continuing to be elucidated and their implications for brain function are emerging as well as applying those advances to interventions that have important possibilities for the treatment of brain dysfunction. The story told in this chapter is about the use of the in oculo transplant method to illuminate intrinsic and extrinsic features that underlie the development of the dentate gyrus and adjacent hippocampus and the role of one molecule in the hippocampus and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia, originally conceptualized as a dysfunction in dopaminergic neurotransmission, is now known to involve multiple neuronal systems. Dysfunction of hippocampal neurons is emerging as one of its signature pathological features. Basic insights into the development and function of hippocampal interneurons form the basis of a new treatment initiative for this illness. Evidence for the role of the alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the development and function of these neurons in rodents has led to human trials of nicotinic agonists for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and the possibility of improving hippocampal development in children at risk for schizophrenia by perinatal supplementation with choline, which can act as an alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist.","A brief historical presentation of the hypothesis on receptor-receptor interactions as an important integrative mechanism taking place at plasma membrane level is given. Some concepts derived from this integrative mechanism especially the possible assemblage of receptors in receptor mosaics (high-order receptor oligomers) and their relevance for the molecular networks associated with the plasma membrane are discussed. In particular, the Rodbell's disaggregation theory for G-proteins is revisited in the frame of receptor mosaic model. The paper also presents some new indirect evidence on A2A;D2 receptor interactions obtained by means of Atomic Force Microscopy on immunogold preparations of A2A and D2 receptors in CHO cells. These findings support previous data obtained by means of computer-assisted confocal laser microscopy. The allosteric control of G-protein coupled receptors is examined in the light of the new views on allosterism and recent data on a homocysteine analogue capable of modulating D2 receptors are shown. Finally, the hypothesis is introduced on the existence of check-points along the amino acid pathways connecting allosteric and orthosteric binding sites of a receptor and their potential importance for drug development.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.10.006 PMID: 19850101  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"The neurodegenerative disease Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the protein huntingtin (htt). Although the gene encoding htt was identified and cloned more than 15 years ago, and in spite of impressive efforts to unravel the mechanism(s) by which mutant htt induces nerve cell death, these studies have so far not led to a good understanding of pathophysiology or an effective therapy. Set against a historical background, we review data supporting the idea that metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation provide a critical link between mutant htt and the pathophysiology of HD. New studies in HD brain and genetic model organisms suggest that the disease may in fact be causally related to early abnormalities in KP metabolism, favoring the formation of two neurotoxic metabolites, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid, over the related neuroprotective agent kynurenic acid. These findings not only link the excitotoxic hypothesis of HD pathology to an impairment of the KP but also define new drug targets and therefore have direct therapeutic implications. Thus, pharmacological normalization of the imbalance in brain KP metabolism may provide clinical benefits, which could be especially effective in early stages of the disease.","Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. Over the last two decades, much evidence has been gathered showing that enhanced free radical levels and an impaired antioxidant pool are important factors underlying the pathophysiological mechanisms in a variety of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative ailments. Since oxidative stress is reported to be implicated in impaired neurogenesis, it is likely that antioxidants such as melatonin and its metabolites could restore or minimize cellular death in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The present review summarizes the recent studies documenting the protective role of melatonin against radiation-induced impairment of neurogenesis and cognitive functions.","Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) is the recently purified endogenous ligand of the previously orphan G-protein coupled parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R). The TIP39-PTH2R system is a unique neuropeptide-receptor system whose localization and functions in the central nervous system are different from any other neuropeptides. TIP39 is expressed in two brain regions, the subparafascicular area in the posterior thalamus, and the medial paralemniscal nucleus in the lateral pons. Subparafascicular TIP39 neurons seem to divide into a medial and a lateral cell population in the periventricular gray of the thalamus, and in the posterior intralaminar complex of the thalamus, respectively. Periventricular thalamic TIP39 neurons project mostly to limbic brain regions, the posterior intralaminar thalamic TIP39 neurons to neuroendocrine brain areas, and the medial paralemniscal TIP39 neurons to auditory and other brainstem regions, and the spinal cord. The widely distributed axon terminals of TIP39 neurons have a similar distribution as the PTH2R-containing neurons, and their fibers, providing the anatomical basis of a neuromodulatory action of TIP39. Initial functional studies implicated the TIP39-PTH2R system in nociceptive information processing in the spinal cord, in the regulation of different hypophysiotropic neurons in the hypothalamus, and in the modulation of affective behaviors. Recently developed novel experimental tools including mice with targeted mutations of the TIP39-PTH2R system and specific antagonists of the PTH2R will further facilitate the identification of the specific roles of TIP39 and the PTH2R.","This article aims at making readers, experimentalists and theorists, more aware of the abstractions made by an observer when measuring and reporting behavioral and neural timescales. These abstractions stow away the fact that, above lower boundaries that reflect fairly well understood physical constraints, observed and reported timescales are often not intrinsic to the biological system; rather, in most cases they reflect conditions that are imposed by the observer through the measuring procedure. This is true at practically every level of organization, from behavior down to molecules. I analyze the impacts of the resulting temporal manifold in behavioral and brain sciences on experimental designs and mathematical modeling.","It has been estimated that more than 80% of alcoholics are also nicotine dependent and that, vice versa, the rate of alcoholism is substantially increased by a factor of 4-10 in the nicotine-dependent population. However, the cause for this very high degree of comorbidity is still largely unknown. At the molecular and cellular level, both drugs have very different mechanisms of action. Nicotine specifically activates ligand-gated ion channels in the brain, which are normally gated by acetylcholine, while alcohol interacts with various neurotransmitter receptors. Despite this diversity, both drugs seem to engage the endogenous opioid system as a modulator of some of its pharmacological effect. An acute exposure to nicotine or alcohol leads to a release of opioid peptides in specific brain regions, thus resulting in an activation of their corresponding receptors. If the brain is exposed repeatedly or chronically to these drugs, adaptive changes in the level and expression of opioid peptides and receptors occur. These adaptive changes are thought to contribute to the homeostatic or allostatic adaptations of the brain, which have been associated with drug dependence. This review summarizes pharmacological and genetic studies in animal models and in humans that have addressed the role of specific opioid peptides and receptors in various stages of the addiction process.","The concept of 'cognitive reserve', and a broader theory of 'brain reserve', were originally proposed to help explain epidemiological data indicating that individuals who engaged in higher levels of mental and physical activity via education, occupation and recreation, were at lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Subsequently, behavioral, cellular and molecular studies in animals (predominantly mice and rats) have revealed dramatic effects of environmental enrichment, which involves enhanced levels of sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation via housing in novel, complex environments. Furthermore, increasing levels of voluntary physical exercise, via ad libitum access to running wheels, can have significant effects on brain and behavior, thus informing the relative effects of mental and physical activity. More recently, animal models of brain disorders have been compared under environmentally stimulating and standard housing conditions, and this has provided new insights into environmental modulators and gene-environment interactions involved in pathogenesis. Here, we review animal studies that have investigated the effects of modifying mental and physical activity via experimental manipulations, and discuss their relevance to brain and cognitive reserve (BCR). Recent evidence suggests that the concept of BCR is not only relevant to brain aging, neurodegenerative diseases and dementia, but also to other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating BCR may not only facilitate future strategies aimed at optimising healthy brain aging, but could also identify molecular targets for novel pharmacological approaches aimed at boosting BCR in 'at risk' and symptomatic individuals with various brain disorders.","Recently, a series of studies have given rise to and provided evidence for the hypothesis that the nucleus submedius (Sm) in the medial thalamus is involved in modulation of nociception. The Sm, ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) constitute a pain modulatory pathway, activation of which leads to activation of the PAG-brainstem descending inhibitory system and depression of the nociceptive inputs in the spinal cord and trigeminal nucleus. Other studies have indicated that the Sm-VLO-PAG pathway plays an important role in the analgesia induced by electroacupuncture stimulation of the acupuncture point (acupoint) for exciting small diameter fiber (A-delta and C group) afferents. Opioid peptides, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate and their related receptors are involved in Sm- and/or VLO-mediated descending antinociception, and a GABAergic disinhibitory mechanism participates in mediating the antinociception induced by activation of mu-opioid receptors, serotonin 1(A) receptors, and dopamine D(2)-like receptors. This review describes these findings, which provide important new insights into the roles of the thalamus and cerebral cortex in descending pain modulation.","Multiple sclerosis is a very disabling inflammatory demyelinating disease of the brain of unknown etiology. Current therapies can reduce new lesion development and partially prevent clinical disease activity, but none can halt the progression, or cure the disease. We will review current therapeutic strategies, which are mostly discussed in literature in terms of their effective inhibition of T cells. However, we argue that many of these treatments also influence the myeloid compartment. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that myelin phagocytosis by infiltrated macrophages and activated microglia is not just a hallmark of multiple sclerosis, but also a key determinant of lesion development and disease progression. We reason that severe side effects and/or insufficient effectiveness of current treatments necessitates the search for novel therapeutic targets, and postulate that these should aim at manipulation of the activation and phagocytic capacity of macrophages and microglia. We will discuss three candidate targets with high potential, namely the complement receptor 3, CD47-SIRPalpha interaction as well as CD200-CD200R interaction. Blocking the actions of complement receptor 3 could inhibit myelin phagocytosis, as well as migration of myeloid cells into the brain. CD47 and CD200 are known to inhibit macrophage/microglia activation through binding to their receptors SIRPalpha and CD200R, expressed on phagocytes. Triggering these receptors may thus dampen the inflammatory response. Our recent findings indicate that the CD200-CD200R interaction is the most specific and hence probably best-suited target to suppress excessive macrophage and microglia activation, and restore immune suppression in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis.","Apoptosis research in the past two decades has provided an enormous insight into its role in regulating cell death. However, apoptosis is only part of the story, and inhibition of neuronal necrosis may have greater impact than apoptosis, on the treatment of stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. Since the ""calpain-cathepsin hypothesis"" was first formulated, the calpain- and cathepsin-mediated regulation of necrotic cascades observed in monkeys, has been demonstrated to be a common neuronal death mechanism occurring from simpler organisms to humans. However, the detailed mechanism inducing lysosomal destabilization still remains poorly understood. Heat-shock protein-70 (Hsp70) is known to stabilize lysosomal membrane and protect cells from oxidative stress and apoptotic stimuli in many cell death pathways. Recent proteomics approach comparing pre- and post-ischemic hippocampal CA1 neurons as well as normal and glaucoma-suffered retina of primates, suggested that the substrate protein upon which activated calpain acts at the lysosomal membrane of neurons might be Hsp70. Understanding the interaction between activated calpains and Hsp70 will help to unravel the mechanism that destabilizes the lysosomal membrane, and will provide new insights into clarifying the whole cascade of neuronal necrosis. Although available evidence is circumferential, it is hypothesized that activated calpain cleaves oxidative stress-induced carbonylated Hsp70.1 (a major human Hsp70) at the lysosomal membrane, which result in lysosomal rupture/permeabilization. This review aims at highlighting the possible mechanism of lysosomal rupture in neuronal death by a modified ""calpain-cathepsin hypothesis"". As the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway is a target of oxidative stress, the implication of autophagy is also discussed.",The subiculum is the principal target of CA1 pyramidal cells. It functions as a mediator of hippocampal-cortical interaction and has been proposed to play an important role in the encoding and retrieval of long-term memory. The cellular mechanisms of memory formation are thought to include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. This review summarizes the contemporary knowledge of LTP and LTD at CA1-subiculum synapses. The observation that the underlying mechanisms of LTP and LTD at CA1-subiculum synapses correlate with the discharge properties of subicular pyramidal cell reveals a novel and intriguing mechanism of cell-specific consolidation of hippocampal output.,"In this review, we examine the history of the neurobiology of suicide, as well as the genetics, molecular and neurochemical findings in suicide research. Our analysis begins with a summary of family, twin, and adoption studies, which provide support for the investigation of genetic variation in suicide risk. This leads to an overview of neurochemical findings restricted to neurotransmitters and their receptors, including recent findings in whole genome gene expression studies. Next, we look at recent studies investigating lipid metabolism, cell signalling with a particular emphasis on growth factors, stress systems with a focus on the role of polyamines, and finally, glial cell pathology in suicide. We conclude with a description of new ideas to study the neurobiology of suicide, including subject-specific analysis, protein modification assessment, neuroarchitecture studies, and study design strategies to investigate the complex suicide phenotype.","Over recent decades, the development of specialised techniques such as patch clamping and site-directed mutagenesis have established the contribution of neuronal ion channel dysfunction to the pathophysiology of common neurological conditions including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, peripheral neuropathy, episodic ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuropathic pain. Recently, these insights from in vitro studies have been translated into the clinical realm. In keeping with this progress, novel clinical axonal excitability techniques have been developed to provide information related to the activity of a variety of ion channels, energy-dependent pumps and ion exchange processes activated during impulse conduction in peripheral axons. These non-invasive techniques have been extensively applied to the study of the biophysical properties of human peripheral nerves in vivo and have provided important insights into axonal ion channel function in health and disease. This review will provide a translational perspective, focusing on an overview of the investigational method, the clinical utility in assessing the biophysical basis of ectopic symptom generation in peripheral nerve disease and a review of the major findings of excitability studies in acquired and inherited neurological disease states.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Inflammation may be associated with the neuropathology of PD due to the following accumulating evidence: excessive microglial activation and increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in the SNpc of patients with PD; the emergence of PD-like symptoms following influenza infection; the increased susceptibility to PD associated with bacterial vaginosis; the presence of inflammatory mediators and activators in animal models of PD; the ability of anti-inflammatory drugs to decrease susceptibility to PD; and the emerging possibility of the use of microglial activation inhibitors as a therapy in PD. In this review, we will discuss the role of inflammation in PD. We will focus on the influence of microglia in the pathogenesis of PD and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for PD, that target microglia.","Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mostly known for being the transporter of thyroxine and retinol. When mutated, TTR is also well-described as the cause of familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a neurodegenerative lethal disorder characterized by systemic deposition of TTR amyloid fibrils, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies have determined that besides its carrier properties, TTR is an important protein in peripheral and central nervous system physiology, namely by participating in behavior, in the maintenance of normal cognitive processes during ageing, amidated neuropeptide processing and nerve regeneration. Additionally, it has been proposed that TTR is neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease, by preventing the formation of amyloid beta fibrils. With the advent of powerful screening techniques, TTR has also been linked to a number of other pathological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, among others. These associations, together with the recently unraveled nervous system-related functions, suggest that the relevance of TTR in physiology, particularly in neurobiology, is undervalued and that additional research in this field is needed. The aim of this review is to integrate in a critical perspective the current scattered knowledge concerning TTR most and less acknowledged functions and its association with several neuropathologies.","Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is central to the somatotropic (growth hormone) axis. It promotes tissue growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adulthood. Accumulating evidence from the last decade, however, reveals that circulating levels of IGF-I also significantly affects cognitive brain function. Specifically, the decline of serum IGF-I might be associated with the age-related cognitive decline in elderly people. Moreover, psychiatric and neurological conditions characterized by cognitive impairment may be characterized by altered levels of IGF-I. Some evidence is emerging that interventions that target the GH/IGF-I axis may improve cognitive functioning, at least in deficient states. As there is evidence linking high serum IGF-I levels with cancer risk, these interventions should be carefully evaluated. On a cellular and molecular level, IGF-I may be a crucial component of neural homeostasis since disturbed IGF-I input is inevitably linked to perturbed function. Consistent with this, all nerve cells are potential targets of IGF-I actions, including neurons, glia, endothelial, epithelial, and perivascular cells. Indeed, many key cellular processes in the brain are affected by IGF-I's neurotrophic and modulatory actions. We review the regulation by IGF-I of neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity and conclude that serum IGF-I is an important mediator of neuronal growth, survival and function throughout the lifespan. The role of IGF-I in synaptic plasticity render its neurotrophic potential a key target for remediating the cognitive impairment associated with a range of neurological conditions.","Although virtually ignored in the literature until recently, the process of 'stretch growth of integrated axon tracts' is perhaps the most remarkable axon growth mechanism of all. This process can extend axons at seemingly impossible rates without the aid of chemical cues or even growth cones. As animals grow, the organization and extremely rapid expansion of the nervous system appears to be directed purely by mechanical forces on axon tracts. This review provides the first glimpse of the astonishing features of axon tracts undergoing stretch growth and how this natural process can be exploited to facilitate repair of the damaged nervous system.","Calcium is involved in many facets of neuronal physiology, including activity, growth and differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory, as well as pathophysiology, including necrosis, apoptosis, and degeneration. Though disturbances in calcium homeostasis in cells from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have been observed for many years, much more attention was focused on amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau as key causative factors for the disease. Nevertheless, increasing lines of evidence have recently reported that calcium dysregulation plays a central role in AD pathogenesis. Systemic calcium changes accompany almost the whole brain pathology process that is observed in AD, including synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, presenilins mutation, Abeta production and Tau phosphorylation. Given the early and ubiquitous involvement of calcium dysregulation in AD pathogenesis, it logically presents a variety of potential therapeutic targets for AD prevention and treatment, such as calcium channels in the plasma membrane, calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Abeta-formed calcium channels, calcium-related proteins. The review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in calcium dysregulation in AD, and an insight on how to exploit calcium regulation as therapeutic opportunities in AD.","There are several eye fields in the primate frontal cortex. The number and location of these oculomotor control zones remain controversial, especially in the human brain. In the monkey, the frontal eye field (FEF) is located in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus at approximately the level of the posterior end of the sulcus principalis, the supplementary eye field (SEF) is located on the dorsomedial frontal cortex, and the cingulate eye field (CEF) in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus. In the human frontal cortex, the location of the FEF varies depending on the method used, electrical stimulation or functional neuroimaging, to establish it. Some investigators have argued that the SEF is located on the medial wall of the frontal lobe but its presumed location remains controversial. The location of the CEF in the human brain is not known. The present article reviews electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging evidence regarding the location of these frontal oculomotor areas in the macaque monkey and human brains and, in light of new findings in the human brain, attempts to reconcile the differences observed in the location of these eye fields using the different techniques. Together, these data suggest the existence of at least four eye fields in the frontal cortex, i.e. the FEF, the SEF, the CEF, and a premotor eye field, and suggest that their anatomical relationships are preserved from monkey to human brain.","Several cellular and molecular mechanisms have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology including abnormal neuronal excitability and vascular events. Drugs from different pharmacological classes are used for migraine prophylaxis. These agents may normalize neuronal excitability by modulating distinct ionic channels and various neurotransmitter systems. They can also block cortical spreading depression, prevent peripheral and/or central pain sensitization, and normalize brainstem function. Most of the drugs recently used in migraine prophylaxis have been identified by serendipidy and they have been originally approved for other indications. Subsequently, their use has been extended to migraine prevention, according to their putative mechanisms of action. More recently, trials on adequate samples of migraine patients have been conducted for several drugs. In the present review, we will present and discuss the pathophysiological bases for the use of antidepressants, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers and antiepileptic drugs in migraine prevention. Currently, the major classes of conventional migraine preventive drugs include the antidepressant amitriptyline, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, and the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and valproic acid. Promising results have recently been obtained for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Some limited clinical findings have also been reported for atypical antipsychotic agents, nutritional supplements and also botulinum toxin. Targets of migraine preventive treatment are to reduce frequency and intensity of attacks and to decrease disability related to chronic headache.","A voluminous literature describes the relationship between disturbed sleep and depression. The breakdown of sleep is one of the cardinal features of depression and often also heralds its onset. Frequent arousals, periods of wakefulness and a short sleep onset REM latency are typical polysomnographic features of depression. The short latency to REM sleep has been attributed to the combination of a monoaminergic deficiency and cholinergic supersensitivity and these irregularities have been proposed to form the biological basis of the disorder. A similar imbalance between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission has been found in narcolepsy, a condition in which frequent awakenings, periods of wakefulness and short sleep onset REM latencies are also characteristic findings during sleep. In many cases of narcolepsy, this imbalance appears to result from a deficiency of hypocretin but once established, whether in depression or narcolepsy, this disequilibrium sets the stage for the dissociation or premature appearance of REM sleep and for the dissociation of the motor inhibitory component of REM sleep or cataplexy. In the presence of this monoaminergic/cholinergic imbalance, gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) may acutely further reduce the latency of REM sleep and induce cataplexy, in both patients with narcolepsy or depression. On the other hand, the repeated nocturnal application of GHB in patients with narcolepsy improves the continuity of sleep, prolongs the latency to REM sleep and prevents cataplexy. Evidence to date suggests that GHB may restore the normal balance between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. As such, the repeated use of GHB at night and the stabilization of sleep over time makes GHB an effective treatment for narcolepsy and a potentially effective treatment for depression.","Though initially described in the early 1960s, it is only within the past decade that the concept of continuing adult neurogenesis has gained widespread acceptance. Neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ) migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) into the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate into interneurons. Neuroblasts from the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal formation show relatively little migratory behavior, and differentiate into dentate gyrus granule cells. In sharp contrast to embryonic and perinatal development, these newly differentiated neurons must integrate into a fully functional circuit, without disrupting ongoing performance. Here, after a brief historical overview and introduction to olfactory circuitry, we review recent advances in the biology of neural stem cells, mechanisms of migration in the RMS and olfactory bulb, differentiation and survival of new neurons, and finally mechanisms of synaptic integration. Our primary focus is on the olfactory system, but we also contrast the events occurring there with those in the hippocampal formation. Although both SVZ and SGZ neurogenesis are involved in some types of learning, their full functional significance remains unclear. Since both systems offer models of integration of new neuroblasts, there is immense interest in using neural stem cells to replace neurons lost in injury or disease. Though many questions remain unanswered, new insights appear daily about adult neurogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, and the fates of the progeny. We discuss here some of the central features of these advances, as well as speculate on future research directions.","Neuroactive steroids refer to steroids that are capable of regulating neuronal activities. Neuroactive steroids, synthesized either de novo in the nervous tissue or in the peripheral endocrine glands or as synthetic steroids, have exhibited numerous important modulatory effects on brain functions and brain diseases. At the cellular level, in addition to the effect on postsynaptic receptors, most neuroactive steroids, including pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, progesterone, allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone and estradiol, have modulatory effects on the release of multiple neurotransmitters like glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-HT. Many of these effects occur in the brain regions involved in learning and memory, emotion, motivation, motor and cognition. Moreover, the effects are rather complicated, maybe depending on many factors such as types of neuroactive steroids, brain regions and presynaptic functional states. The mechanisms are also complicated. Many of them involve rapid non-genomic effects on presynaptic receptors and ion channels like sigma-1 receptor, alpha(1) receptor, nicotine receptor, D1 receptor, NMDA receptor, GABA(A) receptor and L-type Ca(2+) channels. These effects have made neuroactive steroids important regulators of synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and constitute the major basis for many important actions of neuroactive steroids on brain functions and brain diseases.","In mammalian brain, the somatostatin (SRIF: somatotropin release-inhibiting factor) family is composed of two peptides: SRIF and cortistatin (CST), which interact with five different receptor subtypes, sst(1-5). This review summarizes the properties of these receptors, the involvement of somatostatinergic systems in Alzheimer's disease (SRIF/acetylcholine (Ach), SRIF/amyloid beta peptides, and SRIF/tau interactions) and their role in cognition from early studies using cysteamine as an SRIF depleting substance to the use of subtype selective analogues and knockout mice, and modulation of synaptic plasticity. The current SRIF story illustrates how cognition and emotion are intimately integrated in brain function.","Findings derived from neuroimaging of the structural and functional organization of the human brain have led to the widely supported hypothesis that neuronal networks of temporally coordinated brain activity across different regional brain structures underpin cognitive function. Failure of integration within a network leads to cognitive dysfunction. The current discussion on Alzheimer's disease (AD) argues that it presents in part a disconnection syndrome. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and electroencephalography demonstrate that synchronicity of brain activity is altered in AD and correlates with cognitive deficits. Moreover, recent advances in diffusion tensor imaging have made it possible to track axonal projections across the brain, revealing substantial regional impairment in fiber-tract integrity in AD. Accumulating evidence points towards a network breakdown reflecting disconnection at both the structural and functional system level. The exact relationship among these multiple mechanistic variables and their contribution to cognitive alterations and ultimately decline is yet unknown. Focused research efforts aimed at the integration of both function and structure hold great promise not only in improving our understanding of cognition but also of its characteristic progressive metamorphosis in complex chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.","The cell cycle is a delicately manipulated process essential for the development, differentiation, proliferation and death of cells. Inappropriate activation of cell cycle regulators is implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including both acute damage and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Cell cycle activation induces the dividing astrocytes and microglia to activate and proliferate in association with glial scar formation and inflammatory factor production, which play crucial roles in the development of pathology in CNS diseases. On the other hand, in terminally differentiated neurons, aberrant re-entry into the cell cycle triggers neuronal death instead of proliferation, which may be a common pathway shared by some acquired and neurodegenerative disorders, even though multiple pathways of the cell cycle machinery are involved in distinct neuronal demise in specific pathological circumstances. In this paper, we first provide a concise description of the roles of cell cycle in neural development. We then focus on how neural cell cycle dysregulation is related to CNS diseases. Neuronal apoptosis is often detected in acute injury to the CNS such as stroke and trauma, which are usually related to the blockade of the cell cycle at the G1-S phase. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Niemann-Pick disease type C, however, some populations of neurons complete DNA synthesis but the cell cycle is arrested at the G2/M transition. This review summarizes advances in findings implicating cell cycle machinery in neuronal death in CNS diseases.","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be capable of providing significant benefits for several neuropathologies. It is highly effective in reducing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and in alleviating chronic pain. Recently, also Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression have been treated by DBS with encouraging results. However, despite these clinical achievements, the precise action mechanisms of DBS still need to be fully characterized. For this reason, several animal models of DBS have been developed, bringing new insights on the effects of this treatment at molecular and cellular level, and providing new evidence on its physiological and behavioral consequences. In parallel, physiological and imaging studies in patients have contributed to better understanding DBS impact on the function of brain circuits. Here we review the clinical data and experimental work in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo (mostly arisen from studies on DBS of the subthalamic nucleus) in the treatment of PD, which led to the actual knowledge of DBS mechanisms, from molecular to complex behavioral levels.","Oscillatory brain activities have been traditionally studied in the context of how oscillations at a single frequency recorded from a single area could reveal functional insights. Recent advances in methodology used in signal analysis have revealed that cross-frequency coupling, within or between functional related areas, is more informative in determining the possible roles played by brain oscillations. In this review, we begin by describing the cellular basis of oscillatory field potentials and its theorized as well as demonstrated role in brain function. The recent development of mathematical tools that allow the investigation of cross-frequency and cross-area oscillation coupling will be presented and discussed in the context of recent advances in oscillation research based on animal data. Particularly, some pitfalls and caveats of methods currently available are discussed. Data generated from the application of examined techniques are integrated back into the theoretical framework regarding the functional role of brain oscillations. We suggest that the coupling of oscillatory activities at different frequencies between brain regions is crucial for understanding the brain from a functional ensemble perspective. Effort should be directed to elucidate how cross-frequency and area coupling are modulated and controlled. To achieve this, only the correct application of analytical tools may shed light on the intricacies of information representation, generation, binding, encoding, storage and retrieval in the brain.","A key objective of neuroscience research is to understand the processes leading to mature neural circuitries in the central nervous system (CNS) that enable the control of different behaviours. During development, network-constitutive neurons undergo dramatic rearrangements, involving their intrinsic properties, such as the blend of ion channels governing their firing activity, and their synaptic interactions. The spinal cord is no exception to this rule; in fact, in the ventral horn the maturation of motor networks into functional circuits is a complex process where several mechanisms cooperate to achieve the development of motor control. Elucidating such a process is crucial in identifying neurons more vulnerable to degenerative or traumatic diseases or in developing new strategies aimed at rebuilding damaged tissue. The focus of this review is on recent advances in understanding the spatio-temporal expression of the glycinergic/GABAergic system and on the contribution of this system to early network function and to motor pattern transformation along with spinal maturation. During antenatal development, the operation of mammalian spinal networks strongly depends on the activity of glycinergic/GABAergic neurons, whose action is often excitatory until shortly before birth when locomotor networks acquire the ability to generate alternating motor commands between flexor and extensor motor neurons. At this late stage of prenatal development, GABA-mediated excitation is replaced by synaptic inhibition mediated by glycine and/or GABA. At this stage of spinal maturation, the large majority of GABAergic neurons are located in the dorsal horn. We propose that elucidating the role of inhibitory systems in development will improve our knowledge on the processes regulating spinal cord maturation.","Relapse to old, unhealthy eating habits is a major problem in human dietary treatments. The mechanisms underlying this relapse are unknown. Surprisingly, until recently this clinical problem has not been systematically studied in animal models. Here, we review results from recent studies in which a reinstatement model (commonly used to study relapse to abused drugs) was employed to characterize the effect of pharmacological agents on relapse to food seeking induced by either food priming (non-contingent exposure to small amounts of food), cues previously associated with food, or injections of the pharmacological stressor yohimbine. We also address methodological issues related to the use of the reinstatement model to study relapse to food seeking, similarities and differences in mechanisms underlying reinstatement of food seeking versus drug seeking, and the degree to which the reinstatement procedure provides a suitable model for studying relapse in humans. We conclude by discussing implications for medication development and future research. We offer three tentative conclusions: (1)The neuronal mechanisms of food-priming- and cue-induced reinstatement are likely different from those of reinstatement induced by the pharmacological stressor yohimbine. (2)The neuronal mechanisms of reinstatement of food seeking are possibly different from those of ongoing food-reinforced operant responding. (3)The neuronal mechanisms underlying reinstatement of food seeking overlap to some degree with those of reinstatement of drug seeking.","Analysis of the interplay between cell proliferation and death has been greatly advantaged by the development of CNS slice preparations. In slices, interactions between neurons and neurons and the glial cells are fundamentally preserved in a fashion close to the in vivo situation. In parallel, these preparations offer the possibility of an easy experimental manipulation. Two main types of slices are currently in use: the acute slices, which are short living preparations where the major functions of the intact brain (including neurogenesis) are maintained, and the organotypic cultures, where the maturation and plasticity of neuronal circuitries in relation to naturally occurring neuronal death and/or experimental insults can be followed over several weeks in vitro. We will discuss here the main advantages/disadvantages linked to the use of CNS slices for histological analysis of neuronal proliferation and death, as well as the main findings obtained in the most popular types of preparations, i.e. the cortical, hippocampal, cerebellar and retinal slices.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Death due to respiratory failure occurs typically 2-5 years after disease onset. The pathogenic mechanism that underlies ALS remains largely unknown, but is known to include both genetic and environmental factors. At the cellular level, pathological changes in motor neuron connections and loss of neuromuscular contacts precede motor neuron degeneration and clinical symptoms. Several lines of recent evidence support the challenging hypothesis that aberrant expression or function of axon guidance proteins such as Semaphorins, Ephrins, Netrins and Slits, normally involved in sculpting and maintaining motor neuron circuits, may induce such pathological changes in motor neuron circuitry and contribute to the pathogenic mechanism involved in ALS. In the present review, we discuss the emerging roles of axon guidance proteins in the pathogenesis of ALS. First, we summarize our current understanding of the role of axon guidance proteins during the formation of motor neuron circuits. Subsequently, we present several lines of evidence showing an association between aberrant axon guidance protein function or expression and ALS. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of axon guidance proteins in understanding and treating the changes in motor neuron connectivity that underlie this debilitating disease.","Nanotechnology employs engineered materials or devices that interact with biological systems at a molecular level and could revolutionize the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) by stimulating, responding to and interacting with target sites to induce physiological responses while minimizing side-effects. Conventional drug delivery systems do not provide adequate cyto-architecture restoration and connection patterns that are essential for functional recovery in NDs, due to limitations posed by the restrictive blood-brain barrier. This review article provides a concise incursion into the current and future applications of nano-enabled drug delivery systems for the treatment of NDs, in particular Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and explores the application of nanotechnology in clinical neuroscience to develop innovative therapeutic modalities for the treatment of NDs.","Depression is a family of complex and multifactorial illnesses that are characterized by disruptions in the functioning of a number of physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral processes. Of these, sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm abnormalities constitute the most prevalent signs of depressive illness. Difficulty in falling asleep, decreases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency, early morning awakenings, and rapid eye movement sleep alterations are all commonly seen in depressed patients. Advances or delays in the phase of circadian rhythms have been documented in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The disturbances in the amplitude and rhythm of melatonin secretion that occur in patients with depression resemble those seen in subjects with chronobiological disorders. The finding that insomnia and circadian rhythm abnormalities are prominent features in depression suggests that a close link exists between melatonin secretion disturbance and depressed mood. This inference has been further strengthened by the finding that agomelatine, a recently introduced melatonergic agent with a novel mechanism of action, has beneficial effects in patients with MDD, bipolar disorder or SAD. Among agomelatine's characteristics are a rapid onset of action and a pronounced effectiveness for improving sleep efficiency and correcting circadian rhythm abnormalities. Disruptions in melatonin secretion or availability may be the common factor, which underlies depressive disorder and its prominent signs and symptoms such as sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities.","Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a critical regulator of tissue homeostasis and emerging evidence is focused on the role of apoptosis mechanisms in the central nervous system. Generally, apoptosis is necessary to prevent cancerous growths. However, excessive apoptosis in post-mitotic cells such as neurons leads to neurodegeneration. Chronic stress, which can precipitate depression, has been shown to increase the susceptibility of certain populations of neurons to cell death while antidepressant treatment, in general, shows the ability to oppose these effects and promote neuroprotection. Here, we discuss the major players in cell death pathways, the physiological implications of chronic stress and depression, chronic stress models in animals which result in cell death and the different classes of antidepressants and mood stabilizers that have been shown to prevent cell death. We discuss the cellular effects of antidepressants and possible modes of action in preventing apoptosis. Investigations on the role of apoptosis in mediating the molecular, physiological and behavioural effects of antidepressants may help gain a better mechanistic insight into drug action and allow refinement of current therapeutics in order to target these pathways in a specific manner.","Alterations in the epigenetic modulation of gene expression have been implicated in several developmental disorders, cancer, and recently, in a variety of mental retardation and complex psychiatric disorders. A great deal of effort is now being focused on why the nervous system may be susceptible to shifts in activity of epigenetic modifiers. The answer may simply be that the mammalian nervous system must first produce the most complex degree of developmental patterning in biology and hardwire cells functionally in place postnatally, while still allowing for significant plasticity in order for the brain to respond to a rapidly changing environment. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two major epigenetic modifications that contribute to the stability of gene expression states. Perturbing DNA methylation, or disrupting the downstream response to DNA methylation - methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) - by genetic or pharmacological means, has revealed a critical requirement for epigenetic regulation in brain development, learning, and mature nervous system stability, and has identified the first distinct gene sets that are epigenetically regulated within the nervous system. Epigenetically modifying chromatin structure in response to different stimuli appears to be an ideal mechanism to generate continuous cellular diversity and coordinate shifts in gene expression at successive stages of brain development - all the way from deciding which kind of a neuron to generate, through to how many synapses a neuron can support. Here, we review the evidence supporting a role for DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in nervous system development and mature function, and present a basis from which to understand how the clinical use of HDAC inhibitors may impact nervous system function.","Estimated prevalence of childhood and adolescent depression varies from 0.4% to 3% at the 0-12 age range and 3.3% to 12.4% at the 13-18 age range. Despite similarities in the clinical picture of major depression in children, adolescents, and adults, there are notable differences in the neurobiological correlates and treatment response of depressed patients in these different age cohorts. In contrast to adults, most depressed children fail to respond to antidepressants. The main aim of this paper is to review several studies which attempt to develop and examine genetic animal models for childhood depression, in order to enable a search for new, unique treatment approaches for depressed children. Two different ""depressive-like"" rat strains were studied: Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and their controls, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; and the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) strain and their controls, Wistar rats. The results suggest that prepubertal FSL and WKY rats exhibit different styles of depressive behavior, one co-morbid with ""anxiety-like"" behavior (WKY), and one that is not (FSL). These two profiles may model clinical characteristics that resemble two subgroups of depressed children. However, in general the data on the WKY rats would seem most consistent with a classic childhood depressive profile. The FSL profile may possibly be related to chronic stress, and its role as a potential model of childhood depression requires further support. These two different putative genetic animal models of childhood depression can help in the attempts to understand the neurobiological basis and to predict successful treatment strategies for different patterns of childhood psychopathology.","Glial cells, myelin and the interstitium are the structures of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) mainly affected by vitamin B(12) (cobalamin, Cbl) deficiency. Most of the response to the damage caused by Cbl deficiency seems to come from astrocytes and microglia, and is manifested as an increase in the number of cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, the presence of ultrastructural signs of activation, and changes in cytokine and growth factor production and secretion. Myelin damage particularly affects the lamellae, which are disorganized by edema, as is the interstitium. Surprisingly, rat Schwann cells (myelin-forming cells of the peripheral nervous system) are fully activated but the few oligodendrocytes (myelin-forming cells of the CNS) are scarcely activated. The presence of intramyelin and interstitial edema raises questions about the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. The results obtained in the CNS of Cbl-deficient rats indicate that cytokine and growth factor imbalance is a key point in the pathogenesis of Cbl-deficient neuropathy. In the rat, Cbl deficiency increases the spinal cord (SC) synthesis and CSF levels of myelinotoxic cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and soluble (s) CD40:sCD40 ligand dyad) and a myelinotoxic growth factor (nerve growth factor), but decreases SC synthesis and CSF levels of a myelinotrophic cytokine (interleukin-6) and a myelinotrophic growth factor (epidermal growth factor, EGF). The in vivo administration of IL-6 or EGF, or agents antagonizing the excess myelinotoxic agent, is as effective as Cbl in repairing or preventing Cbl-deficiency-induced CNS lesions. An imbalance in TNF-alpha and EGF levels has also been found in the CSF and serum of patients with severe Cbl deficiency.","For over 30 years, scientists have been investigating the phenomenon of pain suppression upon exposure to unconditioned or conditioned stressful stimuli, commonly known as stress-induced analgesia. These studies have revealed that individual sensitivity to stress-induced analgesia can vary greatly and that this sensitivity is coupled to many different phenotypes including the degree of opioid sensitivity and startle response. Furthermore, stress-induced analgesia is influenced by age, gender, and prior experience to stressful, painful, or other environmental stimuli. Stress-induced analgesia is mediated by activation of the descending inhibitory pain pathway. Pharmacological and neurochemical studies have demonstrated involvement of a large number of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. In particular, there are key roles for the endogenous opioid, monoamine, cannabinoid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate systems. The study of stress-induced analgesia has enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of pain and stress and can be a useful approach for uncovering new therapeutic targets for the treatment of pain and stress-related disorders.","Oxytocin (Oxt) is a nonapeptide hormone best known for its role in lactation and parturition. Since 1906 when its uterine-contracting properties were described until 50 years later when its sequence was elucidated, research has focused on its peripheral roles in reproduction. Only over the past several decades have researchers focused on what functions Oxt might have in the brain, the subject of this review. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei are the neurons of origin for the Oxt released from the posterior pituitary. Smaller cells in various parts of the brain, as well as release from magnocellular dendrites, provide the Oxt responsible for modulating various behaviors at its only identified receptor. Although Oxt is implicated in a variety of ""non-social"" behaviors, such as learning, anxiety, feeding and pain perception, it is Oxt's roles in various social behaviors that have come to the fore recently. Oxt is important for social memory and attachment, sexual and maternal behavior, and aggression. Recent work implicates Oxt in human bonding and trust as well. Human disorders characterized by aberrant social interactions, such as autism and schizophrenia, may also involve Oxt expression. Many, if not most, of Oxt's functions, from social interactions (affiliation, aggression) and sexual behavior to eventual parturition, lactation and maternal behavior, may be viewed as specifically facilitating species propagation.","The development of a new generation of hand prostheses that can ideally approximate the human 'physiological' performance in terms of movement dexterity and sensory feedback for amputees still poses many open research challenges. The most promising approaches aim at establishing a direct connection with either the central or the peripheral human nervous system by means of invasive or non-invasive neural interfaces. This paper starts from the assumption that a major contribution to derive functional and technical specifications for such interfaces, and even for the whole prosthetic system, can stem from in-depth analysis of the nervous system reorganization following limb amputation. Neuroplasticity can be modulated by the use of hand prostheses both in the acute phase and in the long-term. We hereby critically review the literature concerning neuroplastic phenomena in amputees, in terms of changes at different CNS levels, particularly for their implications on the development of bidirectional neural interfaces for cybernetic hand prostheses. Our analysis of the literature demonstrates that: (1) the level of CNS reorganization could be used as a parameter of the effectiveness achieved by the prosthetic device and its interfaces, in restoring the hand physiological functionality, (2) the prosthetic system could be seen as a neurorehabilitation tool, as it could induce reduction in aberrant plasticity and promote 'good' plasticity and (3) new generations of 'natural' interfaces can be developed by fully exploiting neuroplastic phenomena to restore neural connections originally governing the lost limb and linking them to the prosthetic system.","Nerve membranes consist of an approximately equal mixture of lipids and proteins. The propagation of nerve pulses is usually described with the ionic hypothesis, also known as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. This model assumes that proteins alone enable nerves to conduct signals due to the ability of various ion channel proteins to transport selectively sodium and potassium ions. While the ionic hypothesis describes electrical aspects of the action potential, it does not provide a theoretical framework for understanding other experimentally observed phenomena associated with nerve pulse propagation. This fact has led to a revised view of the action potential based on the laws of thermodynamics and the assumption that membrane lipids play a fundamental role in the propagation of nerve pulses. In general terms, we describe how pulses propagating in nerve membranes resemble propagating sound waves. We explain how the language of thermodynamics enables us to account for a number of phenomena not addressed by the ionic hypothesis. These include a thermodynamic explanation of the effect of anesthetics, the induction of action potentials by local nerve cooling, the physical expansion of nerves during pulse propagation, reversible heat production and the absence of net heat release during the action potential. We describe how these measurable features of a propagating nerve pulse, as well as the observed voltage change that accompanies an action potential, represent different aspects of a single phenomenon that can be predicted and explained by thermodynamics. We suggest that the proteins and lipids of the nerve membrane naturally constitute a single ensemble with thermodynamic properties appropriate for the description of a broad range of phenomena associated with a propagating nerve pulse.","Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered a paradigm of degenerative diseases of the nervous system characterized by motor impairment (parkinsonism) due to malfunction and loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, PD is a systemic disease of the nervous system with variegated clinical symptoms appearing before parkinsonism and due to the involvement of selected nuclei of the medulla oblongata, pons, autonomic nervous system and olfactory structures, among others. Furthermore, recent clinical data have shown modifications in behavior, personality changes and cognitive impairment leading to dementia. Lewy pathology, hallmark of PD, in the cerebral cortex does not correlate with cognitive impairment. However, recent studies have shown abnormal mitochondria content and function, and increased oxidative stress and oxidative responses in the cerebral cortex in PD. Furthermore, several key PD-related proteins are oxidatively damaged, including alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, superoxide dismutases, parkin, DJ1, UCHL1 and enzymes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism. DNA and RNA are also targets of oxidative damage. Furthermore, abnormal phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and tau occurs at the cortical synapses. Finally, abnormal cortical metabolism has been revealed with neuroimaging methods. These data demonstrate early involvement of the cerebral cortex in PD due to the convergence of multiple metabolic defects. Lewy pathology is a relative late event, geared to isolate unremoved damaged protein, with little significance on cortical neurological deficits.","Identification of novel neurohormones that play important roles in the regulation of pituitary function is essential for the progress of neurobiology. The decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary factor responsible for the hypothalamic control of gonadotropin secretion. Gonadal sex steroids and inhibin inhibit gonadotropin secretion via feedback from the gonads, but a neuropeptide inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion was, until recently, unknown in vertebrates. In 2000, a novel hypothalamic dodecapeptide that inhibits gonadotropin release was identified in quail and termed gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH). This was the first demonstration of a hypothalamic neuropeptide inhibiting gonadotropin release in any vertebrate. GnIH acts on the pituitary and GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus via a novel G protein-coupled receptor for GnIH to inhibit gonadal development and maintenance by decreasing gonadotropin release and synthesis. GnIH neurons express the melatonin receptor and melatonin stimulates the expression of GnIH. Because GnIH exists and functions in several avian species, GnIH is considered to be a new key neurohormone controlling avian reproduction. From a broader perspective, subsequently the presence of GnIH homologous peptides has been demonstrated in other vertebrates. Mammalian GnIH homologous peptides also act to inhibit reproduction by decreasing gonadotropin release in several mammalian species. Thus, the discovery of GnIH has opened the door to a new research field in reproductive neurobiology. This review summarizes the advances made in our understanding of the biosynthesis, mode of action and functional significance of GnIH, a newly discovered key neurohormone, and its homologous peptides.","Clinical trials report that the class of drugs known as statins may be neuroprotective in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and further trials are currently underway to test whether these drugs are also beneficial in multiple sclerosis and acute stroke treatment. Since statins are well tolerated and have relatively few side effects, they may be considered as viable drugs to ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism of their neuroprotective effects is only partly understood. In this article, we review the current data on the neuroprotective effects of statins and their underlying mechanisms. In the first section, we detail the mechanisms by which statins affect cellular signalling. The primary action of statins is to inhibit cellular cholesterol synthesis. However, the cholesterol synthesis pathway also has several by-products, the non-sterol isoprenoids that are also important in cellular functioning. Furthermore, reduced cholesterol levels may deplete the cholesterol-rich membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which in turn could affect cellular signalling. In the second section, we summarize how the effects on signalling translate into general neuroprotective effects through peripheral systems. Statins improve blood-flow, reduce coagulation, modulate the immune system and reduce oxidative damage. The final section deals with the effects of statins on the central nervous system, particularly during Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis.","In the developing brain, cell migration is a crucial process for structural organization, and is therefore highly regulated to allow the correct formation of complex networks, wiring neurons, and glia. In the early postnatal brain, late developmental processes such as the production and migration of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitors still occur. Although the brain is completely formed and structured few weeks after birth, it maintains a degree of plasticity throughout life, including axonal remodeling, synaptogenesis, but also neural cell birth, migration and integration. The subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus are the two main neurogenic niches in the adult brain. Neural stem cells reside in these structures and produce progenitors that migrate toward their ultimate location: the olfactory bulb and granular cell layer of the DG respectively. The aim of this review is to synthesize the increasing information concerning the organization, regulation and function of cell migration in a mature brain. In a normal brain, proteins involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions together with secreted proteins acting as chemoattractant or chemorepellant play key roles in the regulation of neural progenitor cell migration. In addition, recent data suggest that gliomas arise from the transformation of neural stem cells or progenitor cells and that glioma cell infiltration recapitulates key aspects of glial progenitor migration. Thus, we will consider glioma migration in the context of progenitor migration. Finally, many observations show that brain lesions and neurological diseases trigger neural stem/progenitor cell activation and migration toward altered structures. The factors involved in such cell migration/recruitment are just beginning to be understood. Inflammation which has long been considered as thoroughly disastrous for brain repair is now known to produce some positive effects on stem/progenitor cell recruitment via the regulation of growth factor signaling and the secretion of a number of chemoattractant cytokines. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. One of these strategies could consist in increasing the mobilization of endogenous progenitor cells that could replace lost cells and improve functional recovery.","Despite huge improvements in neurobiological approaches for investigating the functional properties of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, many difficulties are still encountered when focusing on the human brain. Electrophysiological studies aimed at performing direct determinations on human nervous tissue are limited by neurosurgery and also by pathophysiological conditions prevailing before and after the resective operation. The electrophysiological study of receptors and channels becomes difficult also in animal models when the cells are not accessible and/or the experiments last many hours, during which the examined nervous tissue usually becomes unhealthy. To increase the possibility of doing optimal electrophysiological recordings, addressed to investigate the functional properties of receptors and channels, more than two decades ago, foreign mRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes to heterologously express the receptors; and about a decade ago cell membranes were injected into the oocytes to directly transplant the native receptors. While the first approach needs complex procedures for mRNA isolation, the membrane preparations are simpler to obtain and the embedded receptors are transplanted in their own membrane, with their own glycosylation and together with any ancillary proteins they may have. Using injections of membranes isolated from fresh nervous tissues several issues have already been addressed and many questions can be answered in the near future. Strikingly, with this approach it has been possible to ""resuscitate"" receptors and ion channels from tissues kept frozen for many years. This review focuses on recently obtained information and on some new lines of biological research using receptor microtransplantation into oocytes.","Dysfunction of the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)) may play a role in the genesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we review the pharmacological, post-mortem, positron emission tomography (PET), and genetic evidence in support of this statement. We also touch briefly on two MDD-associated phenotypes, cognitive impairment and somatic pain. The results of pharmacological challenge studies with 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists are indicative of blunted endocrine responses in depressed patients. Lithium, valproate, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other treatment, such as electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT), all increase post-synaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor signaling through either direct or indirect effects. Reduced somatodendritic and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor numbers or affinity have been reported in some post-mortem studies of suicide victims, a result consistent with well-replicated PET analyses demonstrating reduced 5-HT(1A) receptor binding potential in diverse regions such as the dorsal raphe, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala and hippocampus. 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout (KO) mice display increased anxiety-related behavior, which, unlike in their wild-type counterparts, cannot be rescued with antidepressant drug (AD) treatment. In humans, the G allele of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5-HT(1A) receptor gene (HTR1A; rs6295), which abrogates a transcription factor binding site for deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (Deaf-1) and Hes5, has been reported to be over-represented in MDD cases. Conversely, the C allele has been associated with better response to AD drugs. We raise the possibility that 5-HT(1A) receptor dysfunction represents one potential mechanism underpinning MDD and other stress-related disorders.","The relatively random spiking times of individual neurons are a source of noise in the brain. We show that in a finite-sized cortical attractor network, this can be an advantage, for it leads to probabilistic behavior that is advantageous in decision-making, by preventing deadlock, and is important in signal detectability. We show how computations can be performed through stochastic dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping across barriers in the energy landscape describing the flow of the dynamics in attractor networks. The results obtained in neurophysiological studies of decision-making and signal detectability are modelled by the stochastical neurodynamics of integrate-and-fire networks of neurons with probabilistic neuronal spiking. We describe how these stochastic neurodynamical effects can be analyzed, and their importance in many aspects of brain function, including decision-making, memory recall, short-term memory, and attention.","Periventricular white matter damage (PWMD) also known as periventricular white matter injury, is one of the major causes of neurological impairment in premature newborns. The etiology of white matter injury is multifaceted with hypoxia-ischemia being an important underlying factor. The developing oligodendrocytes are susceptible to damage resulting in myelination deficits. Excess release of glutamate, free radical production, release of cytokines and iron accumulation are factors thought to mediate damage to the developing white matter. Recent studies have also suggested a role for vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of PWMD. Although the role of microglial cells in the development of PWMD is still debatable, our recent investigations have shed some light on their involvement in the pathogenesis of PWMD. Challenges for the future include in-depth investigation of crosstalk between microglia and immature oligodendrocytes as well as other glial cells and vascular endothelial cells.","Since the concept of fetal origins of adult diseases was introduced in 1980s, the development of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in normal and abnormal patterns has attracted attention. Recent studies have shown the importance of the fetal RAS in both prenatal and postnatal development. This review focuses on the functional development of the fetal brain RAS, and ontogeny of local brain RAS components in utero. The central RAS plays an important role in the control of fetal cardiovascular responses, body fluid balance, and neuroendocrine regulation. Recent progress has been made in demonstrating that altered fetal RAS development as a consequence of environmental insults may impact on ""programming"" of hypertension later in life. Given that the central RAS is of equal importance to the peripheral RAS in cardiovascular regulation, studies on the fetal brain RAS development in normal and abnormal patterns could shed light on ""programming"" mechanisms of adult cardiovascular diseases in fetal origins.","Peptide and protein (P/P) drugs have been identified as showing great promises for the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. A major challenge in this regard, however, is the delivery of P/P drugs over the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Intense research over the last 25 years has enabled a better understanding of the cellular and molecular transport mechanisms at the BBB, and several strategies for enhanced P/P drug delivery over the BBB have been developed and tested in preclinical and clinical-experimental research. Among them, technology-based approaches (comprising functionalized nanocarriers and liposomes) and pharmacological strategies (such as the use of carrier systems and chimeric peptide technology) appear to be the most promising ones. This review combines a comprehensive overview on the current understanding of the transport mechanisms at the BBB with promising selected strategies published so far that can be applied to facilitate enhanced P/P drug delivery over the BBB.","When an image is presented to one eye and a very different image is presented to the corresponding location of the other eye, the two images compete for conscious representations, such that only one image is visible at a time while the other is suppressed. Called binocular rivalry, this phenomenon and its deviants have been extensively exploited to study the mechanism and neural correlates of consciousness. In this paper, we propose a framework - the unconscious binding hypothesis - to distinguish unconscious processing from conscious processing. According to this framework, the unconscious mind not only encodes individual features but also temporally binds distributed features to give rise to cortical representations; unlike conscious binding, however, unconscious binding is fragile. Under this framework, we review evidence from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies and come to two important conclusions. First, processing of invisible features depends on the ""level"" of the features as defined by their neural mechanisms. For low-level simple features, prolonged exposure to visual patterns (e.g. tilt) and simple translational motion can alter the appearance of subsequent visible features (i.e. adaptation). For invisible high-level features, complex spiral motion cannot produce adaptation, nor can objects/words enhance subsequent processing of related stimuli (i.e. priming). Yet images of tools can activate the dorsal pathway. Second, processing of invisible features has functional significance. Although invisible central cues cannot orient attention, invisible erotic pictures in the periphery can nevertheless guide attention, likely through emotional arousal; reciprocally, the processing of invisible information can be modulated by attention.","The inflammatory process has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies indicate that inflammation is not merely a bystander in neurodegeneration but a powerful pathogenetic force in the disease process. Increased production of amyloid-beta peptide species can activate the innate immunity system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and evoke Alzheimer's pathology. We will focus on the role of innate immunity system of brain in the initiation and the propagation of inflammatory process in AD. We examine here in detail the significance of amyloid-beta oligomers and fibrils as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the activation of a wide array of PRRs in glial cells and neurons, such as Toll-like, NOD-like, formyl peptide, RAGE and scavenger receptors along with complement and pentraxin systems. We also characterize the signaling pathways triggered by different PRRs in evoking inflammatory responses. In addition, we will discuss whether AD pathology could be the outcome of chronic activation of the innate immunity defence in the brain of AD patients.","The development of chronic pain involves increased sensitivity of peripheral nociceptors and elevated neuronal activity in many regions of the central nervous system. Much of these changes are caused by the amplification of nociceptive signals resulting from the modulation and altered expression of specific ion channels and receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. Understanding the processes by which these ion channels and receptors are regulated and how these mechanisms malfunction may lead to new treatments for chronic pain. Here we review the contribution of the Ca2+-permeable acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC(Ca)) in the development and persistence of chronic pain, and the potential underlying mechanisms. Accumulating evidence suggests that ASIC(Ca) represents an attractive new target for developing effective therapies for chronic pain.","Several models of dystonia have emerged from clinical studies providing a comprehensive explanation for the pathophysiology of this movement disorder. However, several points remain unclear notably concerning the specific role of brainstem, basal ganglia nuclei and premotor cortex. We review data collected in sub-human primate to see whether they might provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dystonia. As in human patients, lesions of the putamen induce dystonia, as well as pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system. In addition, primate studies revealed that lesions in brain stem areas involved in the control of muscular tone and GABAergic manipulations in various basal ganglia nuclei or thalamus also lead to dystonia. Moreover, there is a dramatic disruption in the processing of proprioceptive information with abnormal large receptive fields in the basal ganglia, thalamus, primary somesthetic cortex and premotor cortex of dystonic monkeys. These data highlight the idea that dystonia is associated with aberrant sensory representations interfering with motor control. Considering that the supplementary motor area (SMAp) is the target of basal ganglia projections within the motor loop, we propose a model of dystonia in which abnormal excitability, associated with alteration in sensory receptive fields within the SMAp, leads to an abnormal synchronization between primary motor cortex columns. Such a phenomenon might account for the co-contractions of antagonist muscles favored by action and the abnormal postures observed in dystonia.","The development of the central nervous system (CNS) starts from neural stem cells (NSCs). During this process, NSCs are specified in space- and time-related fashions, becoming spatially heterogeneous and generating a progressively restricted repertoire of cell types: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The processes of neurodevelopment are determined reciprocally by intrinsic and external factors which interface to program and re-program the profiling of fate-determination gene expression. Multiple signaling pathways act in a dynamic web mode to determine the fate of NSCs through modulating the activity of a distinct set of transcription factors which in turn trigger the transcription of neural fate-determination genes. Accumulating evidence reveals that during CNS development, multiple epigenetic factors regulate the activities of extracellular signaling and corresponding transcription factors in a coordinative manner, leading to the formation of a system with sophisticated structure and magic functions. This review aims to introduce recent advances in the epigenetic background of neural cell fate determination.","In this review, we integrate recent human and animal studies from the viewpoint of chronic pain. First, we briefly review the impact of chronic pain on society and address current pitfalls of its definition and clinical management. Second, we examine pain mechanisms via nociceptive information transmission cephalad and its impact and interaction with the cortex. Third, we present recent discoveries on the active role of the cortex in chronic pain, with findings indicating that the human cortex continuously reorganizes as it lives in chronic pain. We also introduce data emphasizing that distinct chronic pain conditions impact on the cortex in unique patterns. Fourth, animal studies regarding nociceptive transmission, recent evidence for supraspinal reorganization during pain, the necessity of descending modulation for maintenance of neuropathic behavior, and the impact of cortical manipulations on neuropathic pain is also reviewed. We further expound on the notion that chronic pain can be reformulated within the context of learning and memory, and demonstrate the relevance of the idea in the design of novel pharmacotherapies. Lastly, we integrate the human and animal data into a unified working model outlining the mechanism by which acute pain transitions into a chronic state. It incorporates knowledge of underlying brain structures and their reorganization, and also includes specific variations as a function of pain persistence and injury type, thereby providing mechanistic descriptions of several unique chronic pain conditions within a single model.","Nanotechnology, which deals with features as small as a 1 billionth of a meter, began to enter into mainstream physical sciences and engineering some 20 years ago. Recent applications of nanoscience include the use of nanoscale materials in electronics, catalysis, and biomedical research. Among these applications, strong interest has been shown to biological processes such as blood coagulation control and multimodal bioimaging, which has brought about a new and exciting research field called nanobiotechnology. Biotechnology, which itself also dates back approximately 30 years, involves the manipulation of macroscopic biological systems such as cells and mice in order to understand why and how molecular level mechanisms affect specific biological functions, e.g., the role of APP (amyloid precursor protein) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aims (1) to introduce key concepts and materials from nanotechnology to a non-physical sciences community; (2) to introduce several state-of-the-art examples of current nanotechnology that were either constructed for use in biological systems or that can, in time, be utilized for biomedical research; (3) to provide recent excerpts in nanotoxicology and multifunctional nanoparticle systems (MFNPSs); and (4) to propose areas in neuroscience that may benefit from research at the interface of neurobiologically important systems and nanostructured materials.","It is just over a decade since the discovery of the first human epilepsy associated ion channel gene mutation. Since then mutations in at least 25 different genes have been described, although the strength of the evidence for these genes having a pathogenic role in epilepsy varies. These discoveries are allowing us to gradually begin to unravel the molecular basis of this complex disease. In the epilepsies, virtually all the established genes code for ion channel subunits. This has led to the concept that the idiopathic epilepsies are a family of channelopathies. This review first introduces the epilepsy syndromes linked to mutations in the various genes. Next it collates the genetic and functional analysis of these genes. This part of the review is divided into voltage-gated channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl(-) and HCN), ligand-gated channels (nicotinic acetylcholine and GABA(A) receptors) and miscellaneous proteins. In some cases significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular and cellular deficits caused by mutations. However, the link between molecular deficit and clinical phenotype is still unknown. Piecing together this puzzle should allow us to understand the underlying pathology of epilepsy ultimately providing novel therapeutic strategies to complete the clinic-bench-clinic cycle.","In neurons, as in other excitable cells, mitochondria extrude Ca(2+) ions from their matrix in exchange with cytosolic Na(+) ions. This exchange is mediated by a specific transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX(mito)). The stoichiometry of NCX(mito)-operated Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange has been the subject of a long controversy, but evidence of an electrogenic 3 Na(+)/1 Ca(2+) exchange is increasing. Although the molecular identity of NCX(mito) is still undetermined, data obtained in our laboratory suggest that besides the long-sought and as yet unfound mitochondrial-specific NCX, the three isoforms of plasmamembrane NCX can contribute to NCX(mito) in neurons and astrocytes. NCX(mito) has a role in controlling neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis and neuronal bioenergetics. Indeed, by cycling the Ca(2+) ions captured by mitochondria back to the cytosol, NCX(mito) determines a shoulder in neuronal [Ca(2+)](c) responses to neurotransmitters and depolarizing stimuli which may then outlast stimulus duration. This persistent NCX(mito)-dependent Ca(2+) release has a role in post-tetanic potentiation, a form of short-term synaptic plasticity. By controlling [Ca(2+)](m) NCX(mito) regulates the activity of the Ca(2+)-sensitive enzymes pyruvate-, alpha-ketoglutarate- and isocitrate-dehydrogenases and affects the activity of the respiratory chain. Convincing experimental evidence suggests that supraphysiological activation of NCX(mito) contributes to neuronal cell death in the ischemic brain and, in epileptic neurons coping with seizure-induced ion overload, reduces the ability to reestablish normal ionic homeostasis. These data suggest that NCX(mito) could represent an important target for the development of new neurological drugs.","Understanding the coordination of multiple parts in a complex system such as the brain is a fundamental challenge. We present a theoretical model of cortical coordination dynamics that shows how brain areas may cooperate (integration) and at the same time retain their functional specificity (segregation). This model expresses a range of desirable properties that the brain is known to exhibit, including self-organization, multi-functionality, metastability and switching. Empirically, the model motivates a thorough investigation of collective phase relationships among brain oscillations in neurophysiological data. The most serious obstacle to interpreting coupled oscillations as genuine evidence of inter-areal coordination in the brain stems from volume conduction of electrical fields. Spurious coupling due to volume conduction gives rise to zero-lag (inphase) and antiphase synchronization whose magnitude and persistence obscure the subtle expression of real synchrony. Through forward modeling and the help of a novel colorimetric method, we show how true synchronization can be deciphered from continuous EEG patterns. Developing empirical efforts along the lines of continuous EEG analysis constitutes a major response to the challenge of understanding how different brain areas work together. Key predictions of cortical coordination dynamics can now be tested thereby revealing the essential modus operandi of the intact living brain.","Involuntary movements, or dyskinesia, represent a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease ultimately experienced by the vast majority of patients. This article does not review the increased understanding of dyskinesia pathophysiology we have seen during the past few years but, instead, specifically focuses upon the very first molecular events thought to be responsible for the establishment of dyskinesia and generally grouped under the term of ""priming"". Priming is classically defined as the process by which the brain becomes sensitized such that administration of a dopaminergic therapy modifies the response to subsequent dopaminergic treatments. In this way, over time, with repeated treatment, the chance of dopaminergic stimulation eliciting dyskinesia is increased and once dyskinesia has been established, the severity of dyskinesia increases. In this opinion review, however, we aim at strongly opposing the common view of priming. We propose, and hopefully will demonstrate, that priming does not exist per se but is the direct and intrinsic consequence of the loss of dopamine innervation of the striatum (and other target structures), meaning that the first injections of dopaminergic drugs only exacerbate those mechanisms (sensitization) but do not induce them. Chronicity and pulsatility of subsequent dopaminergic treatment only exacerbates the likelihood of developing dyskinesia.","Dysfunction of the gastrointestinal neuromuscular apparatus (including interstitial cells of Cajal) is presumed to underlie a heterogeneous group of disorders collectively termed gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMDs). There is increasing experimental and clinical evidence that some GINMDs are immune-mediated, with cell-mediated dysfunction relatively well studied. Humoral (antibody)-mediated autoimmunity is associated with several well-established acquired neuromuscular diseases and is now implicated in an increasing number of less well-characterised disorders, particularly of the central nervous system. The role of autoimmunity in GINMDs has been less studied. Whilst most work has focused on the presence of antibodies directed to nuclear antigens, particularly in the context of secondary disorders such as paraneoplastic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, the possibility that 'functional' anti-neuronal antibodies directed to membrane-bound ion channels may cause disease (channelopathy) is now also being realised. The evidence for humoral autoimmunity as an etiologic factor in primary (idiopathic) and secondary GINMDs is systematically presented using the original paradigms previously applied to established autoimmune neuromuscular disorders. The presence of anti-enteric neuronal antibodies, although repeatedly demonstrated, still requires the identification of specific neuronal autoantigens and validated evidence of pathogenicity.","Classically, the olfactory and vomeronasal pathways are thought to run in parallel non-overlapping axes in the forebrain subserving different functions. The olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia project to the main and accessory olfactory bulbs (primary projections), which in turn project to different areas of the telencephalon in a non-topographic fashion (secondary projections) and so on (tertiary projections). New data indicate that projections arising from the main and accessory olfactory bulbs converge widely in the rostral basal telencephalon. In contrast, in the vomeronasal system, cloning two classes of vomeronasal receptors (V1R and V2R) has led to the distinction of two anatomically and functionally independent pathways that reach some common, but also some different, targets in the amygdala. Tertiary projections from the olfactory and vomeronasal amygdalae are directed to the ventral striatum, which thus becomes a site for processing and potential convergence of chemosensory stimuli. Functional data indicate that the olfactory and vomeronasal systems are able to detect and process volatiles (presumptive olfactory cues) as well as pheromones in both epithelia and bulbs. Collectively, these data indicate that the anatomical and functional distinction between the olfactory and vomeronasal systems should be re-evaluated. Specifically, the recipient cortex should be reorganized to include olfactory, vomeronasal (convergent and V1R and V2R specific areas) and mixed (olfactory and vomeronasal) chemosensory cortices. This new perspective could help to unravel olfactory and vomeronasal interactions in behavioral paradigms.","Neurons have long held the spotlight as the central players of the nervous system, but we must remember that we have equal numbers of astrocytes and neurons in the brain. Are these cells only filling up the space and passively nurturing the neurons, or do they also contribute to information transfer and processing? After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.","Epigenetics and epigenomic medicine encompass a new science of brain and behavior that are already providing unique insights into the mechanisms underlying brain development, evolution, neuronal and network plasticity and homeostasis, senescence, the etiology of diverse neurological diseases and neural regenerative processes. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome repositioning, higher order chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNAs, and RNA and DNA editing. RNA is centrally involved in directing these processes, implying that the transcriptional state of the cell is the primary determinant of epigenetic memory. This transcriptional state can be modified not only by internal and external cues affecting gene expression and post-transcriptional processing, but also by RNA and DNA editing through activity-dependent intracellular transport and modulation of RNAs and RNA regulatory supercomplexes, and through trans-neuronal and systemic trafficking of functional RNA subclasses. These integrated processes promote dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture and the genomic landscape to modulate functional gene and neural networks with complex temporal and spatial trajectories. Epigenetics represents the long sought after molecular interface mediating gene-environmental interactions during critical periods throughout the lifecycle. The discipline of environmental epigenomics has begun to identify combinatorial profiles of environmental stressors modulating the latency, initiation and progression of specific neurological disorders, and more selective disease biomarkers and graded molecular responses to emerging therapeutic interventions. Pharmacoepigenomic therapies will promote accelerated recovery of impaired and seemingly irrevocably lost cognitive, behavioral, sensorimotor functions through epigenetic reprogramming of endogenous regional neural stem cell fate decisions, targeted tissue remodeling and restoration of neural network integrity, plasticity and connectivity.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2010 Jan 11;90(1):69.,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) leads to dramatic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. However, mechanisms involved in promoting and counteracting cerebral vasodilator responses are unclear. Here we review the development and current status of this important field of research especially with respect to the role of perivascular nerves and nitric oxide (NO). It appears that neurotransmitters released from the sensory and the parasympathetic nerves associated with cerebral arteries, and NO released from perivascular nerves and/or parenchyma, promote cerebral hyperemia during CSD. However, the relative contributions of each of these factors vary according to species studied. Related to CSD, axonal and reflex responses involving trigeminal afferents on the pial surface lead to increased blood flow and inflammation of the overlying dura mater. Counteracting the cerebral vascular dilation is the production and release of constrictor prostaglandins, at least in some species, and other possibly yet unknown agents from the vascular wall. The cerebral blood flow response in healthy human cortex has not been determined, and thus it is unclear whether the cerebral oligemia associated with migraines represents the normal physiological response to a CSD-like event or represents a pathological response. In addition to promoting cerebral hyperemia, NO produced during CSD appears to initiate signaling events which lead to protection of the brain against subsequent ischemic insults. In summary, the cerebrovascular response to CSD involves multiple dilator and constrictor factors produced and released by diverse cells within the neurovascular unit, with the contribution of each of these factors varying according to the species examined.","Developing neuronal networks evolve continuously, requiring that neurons modulate both their intrinsic properties and their responses to incoming synaptic signals. Emerging evidence supports roles for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in this neuronal plasticity. HCN channels seem particularly suited for fine-tuning neuronal properties and responses because of their remarkably large and variable repertoire of functions, enabling integration of a wide range of cellular signals. Here, we discuss the involvement of HCN channels in cortical and hippocampal network maturation, and consider potential roles of developmental HCN channel dysregulation in brain disorders such as epilepsy.","Electrical recordings from the surface of the skull have a wide range of rhythmic components. A major task of analysis of this EEG is to determine their source and functional significance. The hippocampal ""theta rhythm"" has been extensively studied in rats and its rhythmicity has recently been shown to be functionally significant, per se. Here, we use relevant aspects of the hippocampal literature to provide perspective on one of the most studied human EEG rhythms: frontal-midline theta. We review its electrographic features, localization, prevalence, age distribution, behavioural modulation (particularly in relation to working memory, spatial navigation, episodic memory, internalised attention and meditation), relationship to personality, drug interactions, neurochemical relationships, and coherence with rhythmic activity at other sites. We conclude that FM-theta, like hippocampal theta, appears to play a role in (or at least occur during) processing of memory and emotion. It is correlated with working memory and/or sustained attention; but this does not entail a role in function since clear behavioural correlates of hippocampal theta have been demonstrated that are not sensitive to hippocampal damage. FM-theta is increased by anxiolytic drug action and personality-related reductions in anxiety, whereas hippocampal theta is decreased by anxiolytic drugs. In animals, frontal theta and hippocampal theta can be phase-locked or independent, depending on behavioural state. So, the cognitive functions of FM-theta, and their relationship to hippocampal theta, are unclear and definitive evidence for functional involvement in cognitive or emotional processing is lacking. One possible solution to this problem is analysis of FM-theta in animals-provided homology can be determined. The issues of sporadicity and low incidence of FM-theta also need to be addressed in the future. Changes in functional connectivity, indicated by changes in coherence, are also a largely untapped resource. We suggest that the most hopeful path to assessing the functions of FM-theta will be through the use of drugs, and the variation of their effects depending on baseline levels of FM-theta. Finally, we review some theories of theta function. Despite the apparent richness of the current data, we conclude that it is difficult (and may ultimately be impossible) to formulate a theory that attributes a specific cognitive function to FM-theta. However, the theories share some general computational assumptions and these should be a useful guide to future work and, ultimately, a definite theory of the function or functions of FM-theta.","Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is widely recognized as a potent survival factor for dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway that degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). In animal models of PD, GDNF delivery to the striatum or the substantia nigra protects dopaminergic neurons against subsequent toxin-induced injury and rescues previously damaged neurons, promoting recovery of the motor function. Thus, GDNF was proposed as a potential therapy to PD aimed at slowing down, halting or reversing neurodegeneration, an issue addressed in previous reviews. However, the use of GDNF as a therapeutic agent for PD is hampered by the difficulty in delivering it to the brain. Another potential strategy is to stimulate the endogenous expression of GDNF, but in order to do that we need to understand how GDNF expression is regulated. The aim of this review is to do a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art on the control of endogenous GDNF expression in the nervous system, focusing mainly on the nigrostriatal pathway. We address the control of GDNF expression during development, in the adult brain and after injury, and how damaged neurons signal glial cells to up-regulate GDNF. Pharmacological agents or natural molecules that increase GDNF expression and show neuroprotective activity in animal models of PD are reviewed. We also provide an integrated overview of the signalling pathways linking receptors for these molecules to the induction of GDNF gene, which might also become targets for neuroprotective therapies in PD.","Insights into the biological basis for mammalian taste quality coding began with electrophysiological recordings from ""taste"" nerves and this technique continues to produce essential information today. Chorda tympani (geniculate ganglion) neurons, which are particularly involved in taste quality discrimination, are specialists or generalists. Specialists respond to stimuli characterized by a single taste quality as defined by behavioral cross-generalization in conditioned taste tests. Generalists respond to electrolytes that elicit multiple aversive qualities. Na(+)-salt (N) specialists in rodents and sweet-stimulus (S) specialists in multiple orders of mammals are well characterized. Specialists are associated with species' nutritional needs and their activation is known to be malleable by internal physiological conditions and contaminated external caloric sources. S specialists, associated with the heterodimeric G-protein coupled receptor T1R, and N specialists, associated with the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, are consistent with labeled line coding from taste bud to afferent neuron. Yet, S-specialist neurons and behavior are less specific than T1R2-3 in encompassing glutamate and E generalist neurons are much less specific than a candidate, PDK TRP channel, sour receptor in encompassing salts and bitter stimuli. Specialist labeled lines for nutrients and generalist patterns for aversive electrolytes may be transmitting taste information to the brain side by side. However, specific roles of generalists in taste quality coding may be resolved by selecting stimuli and stimulus levels found in natural situations. T2Rs, participating in reflexes via the glossopharynygeal nerve, became highly diversified in mammalian phylogenesis as they evolved to deal with dangerous substances within specific environmental niches. Establishing the information afferent neurons traffic to the brain about natural taste stimuli imbedded in dynamic complex mixtures will ultimately ""crack taste codes.""","The basal ganglia as a whole are broadly responsible for sensorimotor coordination, including response selection and initiation. However, it has become increasingly clear that regions of the basal ganglia are functionally delineated along corticostriatal lines, and that a modular conception of the respective functions of various nuclei is useful. Here we examine the specific role of the caudate nucleus, and in particular, how this differs from that of the putamen. This review considers converging evidence from multiple domains including anatomical studies of corticostriatal circuitry, neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers, patient studies of performance deficits on a variety of cognitive tests, and animal studies of behavioural control. We conclude that the caudate nucleus contributes to behaviour through the excitation of correct action schemas and the selection of appropriate sub-goals based on an evaluation of action-outcomes; both processes fundamental to successful goal-directed action. This is in contrast to the putamen, which appears to subserve cognitive functions more limited to stimulus-response, or habit, learning. This modular conception of the striatum is consistent with hierarchical models of cortico-striatal function through which adaptive behaviour towards significant goals can be identified (motivation; ventral striatum), planned (cognition; caudate) and implemented (sensorimotor coordination; putamen) effectively.","The orbitofrontal cortex represents the reward or affective value of primary reinforcers including taste, touch, texture, and face expression. It learns to associate other stimuli with these to produce representations of the expected reward value for visual, auditory, and abstract stimuli including monetary reward value. The orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the goals for action. The learning process is stimulus-reinforcer association learning. Negative reward prediction error neurons are related to this affective learning. Activations in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with the subjective emotional experience of affective stimuli, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotion-related learning, emotional behaviour, and subjective affective state. With an origin from beyond the orbitofrontal cortex, top-down attention to affect modulates orbitofrontal cortex representations, and attention to intensity modulates representations in earlier cortical areas of the physical properties of stimuli. Top-down word-level cognitive inputs can bias affective representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, providing a mechanism for cognition to influence emotion. Whereas the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of reward or affective value on a continuous scale, areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex such as the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 are involved in binary decision-making when a choice must be made. For this decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of each specific reward in a common currency.","One of the proposed functions of sleep is to replenish energy stores in the brain that have been depleted during wakefulness. Benington and Heller formulated a version of the energy hypothesis of sleep in terms of the metabolites adenosine and glycogen. They postulated that during wakefulness, adenosine increases and astrocytic glycogen decreases reflecting the increased energetic demand of wakefulness. We review recent studies on adenosine and glycogen stimulated by this hypothesis. We also discuss other evidence that wakefulness is an energetic challenge to the brain including the unfolded protein response, the electron transport chain, NPAS2, AMP-activated protein kinase, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, production of reactive oxygen species and uncoupling proteins. We believe the available evidence supports the notion that wakefulness is an energetic challenge to the brain, and that sleep restores energy balance in the brain, although the mechanisms by which this is accomplished are considerably more complex than envisaged by Benington and Heller.","In the past several years, we postulated that the loss of Wnt signaling was implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since then, our lab and other groups have confirmed the involvement of the Wnt signaling in some aspects of AD. So far, we have demonstrated that activation of Wnt signaling protects neurons against neurotoxic injuries, including both amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils and Abeta oligomers by using either lithium, an inhibitor of the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), or different Wnt ligands. Also, we have found that several molecules which activate well known neurotransmitter systems and other signaling system, are able by crosstalk to activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in order to protect neurons against both Abeta fibrils or Abeta oligomers. In particular, the activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling was able to protect postsynaptic regions and dendritic spines against Abeta oligomers. Furthermore Wnt signaling ligands also affect stem cells, and they are also involved in cell fate decision during neurogenesis and embryonic development as well as in adult stem cells differentiation in the nervous system. The Wnt signaling plays a key role modulating their cell differentiation or proliferation states. Altogether, these findings in both stem cell biology and neuroprotection, may introduce new approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including drug screening and therapies against neurodegenerative diseases which activates the Wnt signaling pathway.","The amino acid gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory transmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) where it can be released by neurons and by glial cells. Neuronal GABAergic signaling is well characterized: the mechanisms of GABA release, the receptors it targets and the functional consequences of their activation have been extensively studied. In contrast, the corresponding features of glial GABAergic signaling have attracted less attention. In this review, we first discuss evidence from the literature for GABA accumulation, production and release by glial cells. We then review the results of recent experiments that point toward functional roles of GABA as a ""gliotransmitter"".","A constant pattern through the development of cellular life is that not only cells but also subcellular components such as proteins, either being enzymes, receptors, signaling or structural proteins, strictly cooperate. Discerning how protein cooperation originated and propagates over evolutionary time, how proteins work together to a shared outcome far beyond mere interaction, thus represents a theoretical and experimental challenge for evolutionary, molecular, and computational biology, and a timely fruition also for biotechnology. In this review, we describe some basic principles sustaining not only cellular but especially protein cooperative behavior, with particular emphasis on neurobiological systems. We illustrate experimental results and numerical models substantiating that bench research, as well as computer analysis, indeed concurs in recognizing the natural propensity of proteins to cooperate. At the cellular level, we exemplify network connectivity in the thalamus, hippocampus and basal ganglia. At the protein level, we depict numerical models about the receptosome, the protein machinery connecting neurotransmitters or growth factors to specific, unique downstream effector proteins. We primarily focus on the purinergic P2/P1 receptor systems for extracellular purine and pyrimidine nucleotides/nucleosides. By spanning concepts such as single-molecule biology to membrane computing, we seek to stimulate a scientific debate on the implications of protein cooperation in neurobiological systems.","This is the second in a series of canonical reviews on invertebrate muscle. We cover here thin and thick filament structure, the molecular basis of force generation and its regulation, and two special properties of some invertebrate muscle, catch and asynchronous muscle. Invertebrate thin filaments resemble vertebrate thin filaments, although helix structure and tropomyosin arrangement show small differences. Invertebrate thick filaments, alternatively, are very different from vertebrate striated thick filaments and show great variation within invertebrates. Part of this diversity stems from variation in paramyosin content, which is greatly increased in very large diameter invertebrate thick filaments. Other of it arises from relatively small changes in filament backbone structure, which results in filaments with grossly similar myosin head placements (rotating crowns of heads every 14.5 nm) but large changes in detail (distances between heads in azimuthal registration varying from three to thousands of crowns). The lever arm basis of force generation is common to both vertebrates and invertebrates, and in some invertebrates this process is understood on the near atomic level. Invertebrate actomyosin is both thin (tropomyosin:troponin) and thick (primarily via direct Ca(++) binding to myosin) filament regulated, and most invertebrate muscles are dually regulated. These mechanisms are well understood on the molecular level, but the behavioral utility of dual regulation is less so. The phosphorylation state of the thick filament associated giant protein, twitchin, has been recently shown to be the molecular basis of catch. The molecular basis of the stretch activation underlying asynchronous muscle activity, however, remains unresolved.","Since the initial description by Wall [Wall, P.D., 1967. The laminar organization of dorsal horn and effects of descending impulses. J. Neurophysiol. 188, 403-423] of tonic descending inhibitory control of dorsal horn neurons, several studies have aimed to characterize the role of various brain centers in the control of nociceptive input to the spinal cord. The role of brainstem centers in pain inhibition has been well documented over the past four decades. Lesion to peripheral nerves results in hypersensitivity to mild tactile or cold stimuli (allodynia) and exaggerated response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia), both considered as cardinal signs of neuropathic pain. The increased interest in animal models for peripheral neuropathy has raised several questions concerning the rostral conduction of the neuropathic manifestations and the role of supraspinal centers, especially brainstem, in the inhibitory control or in the abnormal contribution to the maintenance and facilitation of neuropathic-like behavior. This review aims to summarize the data on the ascending and descending modulation of neuropathic manifestations and discusses the recent experimental data on the role of supraspinal centers in the control of neuropathic pain. In particular, the review emphasizes the importance of the reciprocal interconnections between the analgesic areas of the brainstem and the pain-related areas of the forebrain. The latter includes the cerebral limbic areas, the prefrontal cortex, the intralaminar thalamus and the hypothalamus and play a critical role in the control of pain considered as part of an integrated behavior related to emotions and various homeostatic regulations. We finally speculate that neuropathic pain, like extrapyramidal motor syndromes, reflects a disorder in the processing of somatosensory information.","Although drugs of abuse have different acute mechanisms of action, their brain pathways of reward exhibit common functional effects upon both acute and chronic administration. Long known for its analgesic effect, the opioid beta-endorphin is now shown to induce euphoria, and to have rewarding and reinforcing properties. In this review, we will summarize the present neurobiological and behavioral evidences that support involvement of beta-endorphin in drug-induced reward and reinforcement. Currently, evidence supports a prominent role for beta-endorphin in the reward pathways of cocaine and alcohol. The existing information indicating the importance of beta-endorphin neurotransmission in mediating the reward pathways of nicotine and THC, is thus far circumstantial. The studies described herein employed diverse techniques, such as biochemical measurements of beta-endorphin in various brain sites and plasma, and behavioral measurements, conducted following elimination (via administration of anti-beta-endorphin antibodies or using mutant mice) or augmentation (by intracerebral administration) of beta-endorphin. We suggest that the reward pathways for different addictive drugs converge to a common pathway in which beta-endorphin is a modulating element. Beta-endorphin is involved also with distress. However, reviewing the data collected so far implies a discrete role, beyond that of a stress response, for beta-endorphin in mediating the substance of abuse reward pathway. This may occur via interacting with the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and also by its interesting effects on learning and memory. The functional meaning of beta-endorphin in the process of drug-seeking behavior is discussed.","Much of the permanent damage that occurs in response to nervous system damage (trauma, infection, ischemia, etc.) is mediated by endogenous secondary processes that can contribute to cell death and tissue damage (excitotoxicity, oxidative damage and inflammation). For humans to evolve mechanisms to minimize secondary pathophysiological events following CNS injuries, selection must occur for individuals who survive such insults. Two major factors limit the selection for beneficial responses to CNS insults: for many CNS disease states the principal risk factor is advanced, post-reproductive age and virtually all severe CNS traumas are fatal in the absence of modern medical intervention. An alternative hypothesis for the persistence of apparently maladaptive responses to CNS damage is that the secondary exacerbation of damage is the result of unavoidable evolutionary constraints. That is, the nervous system could not function under normal conditions if the mechanisms that caused secondary damage (e.g., excitotoxicity) in response to injury were decreased or eliminated. However, some vertebrate species normally inhabit environments (e.g., hypoxia in underground burrows) that could potentially damage their nervous systems. Yet, neuroprotective mechanisms have evolved in these animals indicating that natural selection can occur for traits that protect animals from nervous system damage. Many of the secondary processes and regeneration-inhibitory factors that exacerbate injuries likely persist because they have been adaptive over evolutionary time in the healthy nervous system. Therefore, it remains important that researchers consider the role of the processes in the healthy or developing nervous system to understand how they become dysregulated following injury.","Since the discovery of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in 1987, extensive research has been conducted analyzing the APP-derived beta-amyloid (Abeta) which is found in massive quantities in senile plaques of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Numerous studies over the last two decades have demonstrated the neurotoxic properties of Abeta. However, it is still unclear whether Abeta neurotoxicity is an initial cause or rather a late event in the pathophysiology of AD. The understanding of preclinical AD-related pathophysiological mechanisms is of significant interest in the identification of potential pharmacological targets. In this context another APP-derived cleavage product, the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD), has sparked considerable research interest over the last 7 years. Different AICD levels as a result of gamma-secretase activity may contribute to early pathophysiological mechanisms in AD. However, the relevance of AICD is being discussed highly controversially amongst AD researchers. This review summarizes recent findings in terms of the origin of AICD by regulated intramembrane proteolysis; its structure, binding factors, and post-translational modifications; and its putative role in gene transcription, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal dynamics.","Several exciting approaches for restorative therapy in Parkinson's disease have emerged over the past two decades. This review initially describes experimental and clinical data regarding growth factor administration. We focus on glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), particularly its role in neuroprotection and in regeneration in Parkinson's disease. Thereafter, we discuss the challenges currently facing cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease and briefly consider the possibility to continue testing intrastriatal transplantation of fetal dopaminergic progenitors clinically. We also give a more detailed overview of the developmental biology of dopaminergic neurons and the potential of certain stem cells, i.e. neural and embryonic stem cells, to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Finally, we discuss adult neurogenesis as a potential tool for restoring lost dopamine neurons in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease was first described in 1817 by James Parkinson. It is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, affecting the nigrostriatal pathways involved in the control of movement. Since the introduction of L-DOPA as a therapy in the mid-1960s, clinical management of the symptoms has progressed, but, at present, it remains impossible to stop the disease progression or to restore lost functions. A better understanding of neurodegeneration and of midbrain neuronal development has allowed the development of new pharmaceutical compounds with neuroprotective properties and has shown the potential of neurone replacement therapies in Parkinson's disease. Even though major obstacles remain before these can be transferred to the clinic, the progress made in the last 10 years brings hope of improved therapies for Parkinson's disease. In this paper we review the current knowledge of Parkinson's disease including its etiology, some of the current symptomatic therapeutic modalities, and recent progress in neuroprotective and cell replacement therapies.","Acupuncture has been accepted to effectively treat chronic pain by inserting needles into the specific ""acupuncture points"" (acupoints) on the patient's body. During the last decades, our understanding of how the brain processes acupuncture analgesia has undergone considerable development. Acupuncture analgesia is manifested only when the intricate feeling (soreness, numbness, heaviness and distension) of acupuncture in patients occurs following acupuncture manipulation. Manual acupuncture (MA) is the insertion of an acupuncture needle into acupoint followed by the twisting of the needle up and down by hand. In MA, all types of afferent fibers (Abeta, Adelta and C) are activated. In electrical acupuncture (EA), a stimulating current via the inserted needle is delivered to acupoints. Electrical current intense enough to excite Abeta- and part of Adelta-fibers can induce an analgesic effect. Acupuncture signals ascend mainly through the spinal ventrolateral funiculus to the brain. Many brain nuclei composing a complicated network are involved in processing acupuncture analgesia, including the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), periaqueductal grey (PAG), locus coeruleus, arcuate nucleus (Arc), preoptic area, nucleus submedius, habenular nucleus, accumbens nucleus, caudate nucleus, septal area, amygdale, etc. Acupuncture analgesia is essentially a manifestation of integrative processes at different levels in the CNS between afferent impulses from pain regions and impulses from acupoints. In the last decade, profound studies on neural mechanisms underlying acupuncture analgesia predominately focus on cellular and molecular substrate and functional brain imaging and have developed rapidly. Diverse signal molecules contribute to mediating acupuncture analgesia, such as opioid peptides (mu-, delta- and kappa-receptors), glutamate (NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors), 5-hydroxytryptamine, and cholecystokinin octapeptide. Among these, the opioid peptides and their receptors in Arc-PAG-NRM-spinal dorsal horn pathway play a pivotal role in mediating acupuncture analgesia. The release of opioid peptides evoked by electroacupuncture is frequency-dependent. EA at 2 and 100Hz produces release of enkephalin and dynorphin in the spinal cord, respectively. CCK-8 antagonizes acupuncture analgesia. The individual differences of acupuncture analgesia are associated with inherited genetic factors and the density of CCK receptors. The brain regions associated with acupuncture analgesia identified in animal experiments were confirmed and further explored in the human brain by means of functional imaging. EA analgesia is likely associated with its counter-regulation to spinal glial activation. PTX-sesntive Gi/o protein- and MAP kinase-mediated signal pathways as well as the downstream events NF-kappaB, c-fos and c-jun play important roles in EA analgesia.","Retinoids are important signals in brain development. They regulate gene transcription by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and, as was discovered recently, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Traditional ligands of PPAR are best known for their functions in lipid metabolism and inflammation. RAR and PPAR are ligand-activated transcription factors, which share members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family as heterodimeric partners. Both signal transduction pathways have recently been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Since inflammatory processes contribute to various neurodegenerative diseases, the anti-inflammatory activity of retinoids and PPARgamma agonists recommends them as potential therapeutic targets. In addition, genetic linkage studies, transgenic mouse models and experiments with vitamin A deprivation provide evidence that retinoic acid signaling is directly involved in physiology and pathology of motoneurons, of the basal ganglia and of cognitive functions. The activation of PPAR/RXR and RAR/RXR transcription factors has therefore been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in disorders of the central nervous system.",Comment in Chin Med J (Engl). 2014;127(17):3134.,"At least some neurotrophins may be powerful modulators of synapses, thereby influencing short- and long-term synaptic efficiency. BDNF acts at central synapses in pain pathways both at spinal and supraspinal levels. Neuronal synthesis, subcellular storage/co-storage and release of BDNF at these synapses have been characterized on anatomical and physiological grounds, in parallel with trkB (the high affinity BDNF receptor) distribution. Histological and functional evidence has been provided, mainly from studies on acute slices and intact animals, that BDNF modulates fast excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic/glycinergic) signals, as well as slow peptidergic neurotrasmission in spinal cord. Recent studies have unraveled some of the neuronal circuitries and mechanisms involved, highlighting the key role of synaptic glomeruli in lamina II as the main sites for such a modulation.","There has been an abundance of literature devoted to the involvement of noradrenaline in basic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep processes since the subject was first investigated in 1964. Nowadays, the great majority of studies highlight the need for silence in the locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons as a condition for the occurrence and maintenance of REM sleep. However, throughout the successive years of work on this topic, few researchers have consistently claimed that some amount of noradrenaline is essential for the appearance of this sleep stage. In the first part of this review, each of the papers published in this field is analyzed. Then, in the discussion, arguments supporting the requirement for a given level of noradrenaline for REM sleep occurrence are presented. This second part also examines, based on waking noradrenergic influences on higher integrated brain processes, the major consequences of noradrenergic neuron silence during REM sleep for mental functioning.","This review article discusses recent progress on the use of teratocarcinoma-derived Ntera2/D1 neuron-like cells (NT2N cells, also called hNT cells) as graft source for cell transplantation in stroke. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of NT2N cells in stroke therapy. Phase I and II clinical trials have shown the cells' feasibility, safety and tolerability profiles in stroke patients. Despite these novel features of NT2N cells, the transplantation regimen remains to be optimized. Moreover, determining the mechanisms underlying the grafts' beneficial effects, specifically demonstrating functional synaptic connections between host brain and NT2N cell grafts, warrants further examination. The major limiting factor for initiating a large clinical trial is the cells' highly potent proliferative property due to their cancerous origin, thereby raising the concern that these cells may revert to a neoplastic state over time after transplantation. To this end, we explored a proof-of-concept ""retroviral"" strategy to further establish the post-mitotic status of NT2N cells by transfecting these cells with the transcription factor Nurr1, in addition to the standard treatment with retinoic acid and mitotic inhibitors. This new cell line NT2N.Nurr1 displays an expedited neuronal commitment and secretes a high level of the neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and when transplanted into the rodent stroke brain expressed neuronal phenotype and reduced behavioral impairments which are comparable, if not more robust, than those produced by NT2N cells. Such highly potent neuronal lineage commitment and neurotrophic factor secretory function of NT2.Nurr1 cells make them an appealing graft source for transplantation therapy.","The acute neuronal degeneration in the ischemic core upon stroke is followed by a second wave of cell demise in the ischemic penumbra and neuroanatomically connected sites. This temporally delayed deleterious event of programmed cell death ('secondary degeneration') often exceeds the initial damage of stroke and, thus, contributes pivotally to significant losses in neurological functions. In fact, it is the injured neurons in these regions around the ischemic core zone that neuropharmacological prevention is targeting to preserve. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have focussed on neuroprotective interventions with caspase inhibitors, but it remains ambiguous whether diminishing or even silencing these aspartate-specific cysteine proteases are in sum beneficial for the clinical outcome. It is often ignored that caspase inhibitors are able to antagonize calpain and cathepsins, thereby protecting the cytoskeleton from damage. Moreover, there is a point of no return, beyond which interfering with caspases cannot rescue the cell, but spoil the obligate and necessary suicide program such that the cellular environment suffers from by-products of necrosis and secondary inflammation. Here we discuss novel alternative strategies to abrogate the death cascade at the level of the genomic response (transcription factors, NF-kappaB, CREB, ICER, HIF), of mitochondrial effectors (cytochrome c, Bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2), and of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). IAPs are the only known endogenous proteins that inhibit specifically and with high affinity the activity of both initiator and effector caspases. Based on compelling biochemical evidence, we argue that patronizing the neuronal endogenous anti-apoptotic machinery could be superior to the pharmacological inhibition of caspases at various levels, with regard to specificity, side effects, and the 'therapeutic window of opportunity'.","In this short review, neurochemical targets are identified where nicotine, and possibly ethanol, may interact to prevent the occurrence of Parkinson's disease. These are (a) the nicotinic acetycholine receptors present in the nigrostriatal area or on the surface of microglia, (b) monoamine oxidases and (c) inducible nitric oxide synthase. If such induced changes can be verified in clinical studies, this may help in the design of new therapeutic drugs which may be of relevance to diminish the incidence and perhaps the progression of the debilitating condition of Parkinson's disease.","The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the main intracellular pathway for regulated protein turnover. This system is of vital importance for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential for neuronal functioning. It is therefore not surprising that impairment of this system is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including neurological disorders, which are pathologically characterized by the presence of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates. A direct correlation between intact neuronal functioning and the UPS is exemplified by a range of transgenic mouse models wherein mutations in components of the UPS lead to a neurodegenerative or neurological phenotype. These models have been proven useful in determining the role of the UPS in the nervous system in health and disease. Furthermore, recently developed in vivo models harboring reporter systems to measure UPS activity could also substantially contribute to understanding the effect of neurodegeneration on UPS function. The role of the UPS in neurodegeneration in vivo is reviewed by discussing the currently available murine models showing a neurological phenotype induced by genetic manipulation of the UPS.","As a principal neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau has been recognized to play major roles in promoting microtubule assembly and stabilizing the microtubules and to maintain the normal morphology of the neurons. Recent studies suggest that tau, upon alternative mRNA splicing and multiple posttranslational modifications, may participate in the regulations of intracellular signal transduction, development and viability of the neurons. Furthermore, tau gene mutations, aberrant mRNA splicing and abnormal posttranslational modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation, have also been found in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as tauopathies. Therefore, changes in expression of the tau gene, alternative splicing of its mRNA and its posttranslational modification can modulate the normal architecture and functions of neurons as well as in a situation of tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the latest developments and perspectives in our understanding about the roles of tau, especially hyperphosphorylation, in the development, degeneration and protection of neurons.","Given that erythropoietin (EPO) is no longer believed to have exclusive biological activity in the hematopoietic system, EPO is now considered to have applicability in a variety of nervous system disorders that can overlap with vascular disease, metabolic impairments, and immune system function. As a result, EPO may offer efficacy for a broad number of disorders that involve Alzheimer's disease, cardiac insufficiency, stroke, trauma, and diabetic complications. During a number of clinical conditions, EPO is robust and can prevent metabolic compromise, neuronal and vascular degeneration, and inflammatory cell activation. Yet, use of EPO is not without its considerations especially in light of frequent concerns that may compromise clinical care. Recent work has elucidated a number of novel cellular pathways governed by EPO that can open new avenues to avert deleterious effects of this agent and offer previously unrecognized perspectives for therapeutic strategies. Obtaining greater insight into the role of EPO in the nervous system and elucidating its unique cellular pathways may provide greater cellular viability not only in the nervous system but also throughout the body.","The great repertoire of movements in higher order mammals comes courtesy of the corticospinal tract (CST) which is able to initiate precise movement of the entire musculature of the axial and limb muscle groups. It forms the longest axonal trajectory in the mammalian central nervous system and its axons must navigate the entire length of the central nervous system--from its origins in the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex down through the cerebral peduncles and brainstem and along the entire length of the spinal cord. This period of navigation is incredibly complex, and relies upon the coordinated regulation of a collection of molecular guidance cues - coming from all of the known major families of guidance cues - the ephrins, slits, Netrins and Semaphorins - that work together to steer the growing axonal tips through the brain and spinal cord. As such a long tract, the CST forms an excellent experimental model to investigate the nature of molecular cues that sequentially guide axons through the central nervous system. Using the rodent as a model system, this review discusses each step of axonal guidance through the major brain regions--starting from the decision to grow ventrally out of the cortical plate to the eventual activity-dependent refinement of circuitry in the spinal grey matter. In recent years, the identification of these guidance cues and their proposed mode of action is beginning to give us a picture at a molecular level of how the CST is guided so accurately over such a long distance.","Given the array of biological changes induced by stressors, it is not surprising that these experiences may provoke a variety of illnesses. Among others things, stressors promote functional changes of neuropeptide and classical neurotransmitter systems. The peptidergic changes, for instance, include alterations of corticotropin releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin, and bombesin-like peptides at specific brain sites. Similarly some of the neurotransmitter systems influenced by stressors include GABAergic and monoamine functioning. Variations of these processes may limit neurogenesis (and dysregulation of growth factors such as BDNF) and influence cellular viability (through NFkappaB and MAP kinase pathways). As well, stressors activate the inflammatory immune system, notably the release of signaling molecules (cytokines), which may provoke many of the same neuropeptide (and other neurotransmitter) changes. By virtue of their actions on neuronal functioning, inflammatory processes may influence stress-related illness, such as depression, and may be a common denominator for the comorbidity that exists between depression and neurological conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as cardiovascular-related pathology. The present report provides an overview of biological endophenotypes associated with stressors that are thought to be related to major depressive disorder and related comorbid conditions. The view is taken that synergy between stressors and inflammatory factors may promote pathological outcomes through their actions on neuropeptides and several neurotransmitters. As well, stressful events may result in the sensitization of neurochemical and cytokine processes, so that later re-exposure to these stimuli may promote rapid and exaggerated responses that favor illness recurrence.","Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral midbrain (i.e. mesodiencephalic dopamine, mdDA, neurons) are essential for the control of diverse cognitive and motor behaviors and are associated with multiple psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Three anatomically and functionally distinct subgroups of mdDA neurons have been identified (A8-A10) which give rise to prominent forebrain projections (i.e. the mesostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways). The development of mdDA neurons is a complex, multi-step process. It includes early developmental events such as cell fate specification, differentiation and migration, and later events including neurite growth, guidance and pruning, and synapse formation. Significant progress has been made in defining the early events involved in mdDA neuron development [see Smits, S.M., Burbach, J.P., Smidt, M.P., 2006. Developmental origin and fate of meso-diencephalic dopamine neurons. Prog. Neurobiol. 78, 1-16.]. Although later stages of mdDA neuron development are less well understood, recent studies have begun to identify cellular and molecular signals thought to be involved in establishing mdDA neuronal connectivity. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of the ontogeny and anatomy of mdDA axon pathways, to highlight recent progress in defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation and remodeling of mdDA circuits, and to discuss the significance of this progress for understanding and treating situations of perturbed connectivity in the mdDA system.","Gain-of-function mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene are implicated in progressive motor neuron death and paralysis in one form of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At present, transgenic expression of 12 human SOD1 mutations driven by the endogenous promoter is disease-causative and uniformly lethal in mice and rats, despite tremendous biochemical and biophysical variation between the mutants tested. This contrasts with the subclinical motor neuron disease phenotypes of wild-type SOD1 transgenic and knockout mice. Molecular mechanisms such as glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, axonal transport blockade, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and apoptosis triggered by mutant SOD1 catalysed oxidative reactions and/or protein misfolding are proposed to drive ALS pathogenesis. Around 100 genetic cross-breeding experiments with transgenic mutant SOD1 mice have been performed to verify these mechanisms in vivo. Furthermore, mounting evidence from mice with cell restrictive, repressible or chimeric expression of mutant SOD1 transgenes and bone marrow transplants supports non-neuronal origins of neuroprotection in ALS. Transgenic mutant SOD1 rodents have also provided the benchmark preclinical tool for evaluation of over 150 potential therapeutic anti-oxidant, anti-aggregation, anti-glutamatergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic pharmacological agents. Recent promising findings from gene and antisense therapies, cell replacement and combinatorial drug approaches in transgenic mutant SOD1 rodents are also emerging, but await successful translation in patients. This review summarises the wealth of known genetic and therapeutic modifiers in rodent models with SOD1 mutations and discusses these in the wider context of ALS pathoetiology and treatment.","Nitric oxide (NO), a diffusible molecule acting as an intercellular and intracellular messenger in many tissues, plays multiple roles in the nervous system. In addition to regulating proliferation, survival and differentiation of neurons, NO is also involved in synaptic activity, neural plasticity and memory formation. Long-lasting effects of NO, a simple and unstable molecule, occur through regulation of transcription factors and modulation of gene expression. cAMP-response-element-binding (CREB) protein is an important transcription factor that regulates the expression of several genes involved in survival and neuroprotection as well as in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Nitric oxide promotes survival and differentiation of neural cells, both activating through cGMP signaling CREB phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional activity and promoting S-nitrosylation of nuclear proteins that favor CREB binding to its promoters on target genes. Among oncogenic transcription factors, N-Myc is important in neurogenesis and in regulating proliferation of neural-derived tumor cells, such as neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas. Nitric oxide negatively regulates the proliferation of neuronal precursors, as well as the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, by downregulating N-Myc expression through cGMP signaling. Other oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-fos and c-jun, zinc-finger transcription factors, such as egr-1, and NF-kappaB are regulated by NO signaling in cGMP-dependent way or through nitrosative conformational changes. The present survey of how NO signaling influences neural cells through regulation of transcription factors allows us to predict that better knowledge of these interactions will provide a better understanding of the physiological role of NO in the nervous system in order to conceive novel therapies for neural-derived tumors.","It is widely accepted that the complexity and adaptability of neuronal communication, which is necessary for integrative and higher functions of the brain, is amply represented by plastic changes occurring at synaptic level. Therefore, long-term modifications of synaptic efficacy between neurons have been considered the cellular basis of learning and memory. Accordingly, there is a plethora of experimental evidence supporting this contention. Indeed, synaptic modifications in the hippocampus, the cerebral and cerebellar cortices regulate composite neuronal functions such those related to cognition, awareness, memory storage, and motion. In recent years, the concept that enduring changes of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic potentials [long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)] are not limited to the hippocampus and cortices but occur also in other brain areas has emerged. For instance, plasticity at different excitatory pathways has been clearly demonstrated in the basal ganglia. Here we present an overview of the experimental data regarding synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia and highlight how results reported in the literature are often contradictory, especially when compared to those obtained in the hippocampal area. In trying to propose possible explanations to some of these contradictions, we present a holistic approach that re-interprets the basal ganglia synaptic plasticity in terms of expression of physiological and pathological phenomena and therapeutic effects of drugs.","Nicotine can both activate and desensitize/inactivate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). An ongoing controversy in the field is to what extent the behavioral effects of nicotine result from activation of nAChRs, and to what extent receptor desensitization is involved in these behavioral processes. Recent electrophysiological studies have shown that both nAChR activation and desensitization contribute to the effects of nicotine in the brain, and these experiments have provided cellular mechanisms that could underlie the contribution of both these processes to nicotine-mediated behaviors. For instance, desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to the salience of environmental cues associated with smoking behavior and activation and desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to both primary and conditioned drug reward. Similarly, studies of the antidepressant-like effects of nicotinic agents have revealed a balance between activation and desensitization of nAChRs. This review will examine the evidence for the contribution of these two very different consequences of nicotine administration to behaviors related to nicotine addiction, including processes related to drug reinforcement and affective modulation. We conclude that there are effects of nAChR activation and desensitization on drug reinforcement and affective behavior, and that both processes are important in the behavioral consequences of nicotine in tobacco smoking.","Neuroprotection is increasingly considered as a promising therapy for preventing and treating temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The development of chronic TLE, also termed as epileptogenesis, is a dynamic process. An initial precipitating injury (IPI) such as the status epilepticus (SE) leads to neurodegeneration, abnormal reorganization of the brain circuitry and a significant loss of functional inhibition. All of these changes likely contribute to the development of chronic epilepsy, characterized by spontaneous recurrent motor seizures (SRMS) and learning and memory deficits. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current state of knowledge pertaining to neuroprotection in epileptic conditions, and to highlight the efficacy of distinct neuroprotective strategies for preventing or treating chronic TLE. Although the administration of certain conventional and new generation anti-epileptic drugs is effective for primary neuroprotection such as reduced neurodegeneration after acute seizures or the SE, their competence for preventing the development of chronic epilepsy after an IPI is either unknown or not promising. On the other hand, alternative strategies such as the ketogenic diet therapy, administration of distinct neurotrophic factors, hormones or antioxidants seem useful for preventing and treating chronic TLE. However, long-term studies on the efficacy of these approaches introduced at different time-points after the SE or an IPI are lacking. Additionally, grafting of fetal hippocampal cells at early time-points after an IPI holds considerable promise for preventing TLE, though issues regarding availability of donor cells, ethical concerns, timing of grafting after SE, and durability of graft-mediated seizure suppression need to be resolved for further advances with this approach. Overall, from the studies performed so far, there is consensus that neuroprotective strategies need to be employed as quickly as possible after the onset of the SE or an IPI for considerable beneficial effects. Nevertheless, ideal strategies that are capable of facilitating repair and functional recovery of the brain after an IPI and preventing the evolution of IPI into chronic epilepsy are still hard to pin down.","Our perception of a visual scene changes rapidly in time, even when the scene itself does not. It is increasingly clear that understanding how the visual percept changes in time is crucial to understanding how we see. We are still far from fully understanding the temporal changes in the visual percept and the neural mechanisms that underlie it. But recently, many disparate lines of evidence are beginning to converge to produce a complex but fuzzy picture of visual temporal dynamics. It is clear, largely from psychophysical studies in humans, that one can get the 'gist' of complex visual scenes within about 150ms after the stimulus onset, even when the stimulus itself is presented as briefly as 10 ms or so. It generally takes longer processing, if not longer stimulus presentation, to identify individual objects. It may take even longer for a fuller semantic understanding, or awareness, of the scene to emerge and be encoded in short-term memory. Microelectrode recording studies in monkeys, along with neuroimaging studies mostly in humans, have elucidated many important temporal dynamic phenomena at the level of individual neurons and neuronal populations. Many of the temporal changes at the perceptual and the neural levels can be captured by the multifaceted and somewhat ambiguous concept of coarse-to-fine processing, although it is clear that not all temporal changes can be characterized this way. A more comprehensive, albeit unproven, alternative framework for understanding visual temporal dynamics is to view it as a sequential, Bayesian decision-making process. At each step, the visual system infers the likely nature visual scene by jointly evaluating the available processed image information and prior knowledge about the scene, including prior inferences. Whether the processing proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion depends largely on whether the underlying computations are hierarchical or not. Characterizing these inferential steps from the computational, perceptual and neural standpoints will be a key part of future work in this emerging field.","Acute traumatic and ischemic events in the central nervous system (CNS) invariably result in activation of microglial cells as local representatives of the immune system. It is still under debate whether activated microglia promote neuronal survival, or whether they exacerbate the original extent of neuronal damage. Protagonists of the view that microglial cells cause secondary damage have proposed that inhibition of microglial activation by immunosuppression is beneficial after acute CNS damage. It is the aim of this review to analyse the effects of immunosuppressants on isolated microglial cells and neurons, and to scrutinize the effects of immunosuppression in different in vivo models of acute CNS trauma or ischemia. It is found that the immunosuppressants cytosine-arabinoside, different steroids, cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline all have direct inhibitory effects on microglial cells. These effects are mainly exerted by inhibiting microglial proliferation or microglial secretion of neurotoxic substances such as proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. Furthermore, immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia results in improved structure preservation and, mostly, in enhanced function. However, all investigated immunosuppressants also have direct effects on neurons, and some immunosuppressants affect other glial cells such as astrocytes. In summary, it is safe to conclude that immunosuppression after acute CNS trauma or ischemia is neuroprotective. Furthermore, circumferential evidence indicates that microglial activation after traumatic or ischemic CNS damage is not beneficial to adjacent neurons in the immediate aftermath of such acute lesions. Further experiments with more specific agents or genetic approaches that specifically inhibit microglial cells are needed in order to fully answer the question of whether microglial activation is ""good or bad"".","Current therapies for epilepsy are largely symptomatic and do not affect the underlying mechanisms of disease progression, i.e. epileptogenesis. Given the large percentage of pharmacoresistant chronic epilepsies, novel approaches are needed to understand and modify the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Although different types of brain injury (e.g. status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, stroke) can trigger epileptogenesis, astrogliosis appears to be a homotypic response and hallmark of epilepsy. Indeed, recent findings indicate that epilepsy might be a disease of astrocyte dysfunction. This review focuses on the inhibitory neuromodulator and endogenous anticonvulsant adenosine, which is largely regulated by astrocytes and its key metabolic enzyme adenosine kinase (ADK). Recent findings support the ""ADK hypothesis of epileptogenesis"": (i) Mouse models of epileptogenesis suggest a sequence of events leading from initial downregulation of ADK and elevation of ambient adenosine as an acute protective response, to changes in astrocytic adenosine receptor expression, to astrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy (i.e. astrogliosis), to consequential overexpression of ADK, reduced adenosine and - finally - to spontaneous focal seizure activity restricted to regions of astrogliotic overexpression of ADK. (ii) Transgenic mice overexpressing ADK display increased sensitivity to brain injury and seizures. (iii) Inhibition of ADK prevents seizures in a mouse model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. (iv) Intrahippocampal implants of stem cells engineered to lack ADK prevent epileptogenesis. Thus, ADK emerges both as a diagnostic marker to predict, as well as a prime therapeutic target to prevent, epileptogenesis.","Natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial, brain and C-type NPs, are a family of structurally related but genetically distinct peptides. These peptides, along with their receptors (NPRs), are long known to be involved in the regulation of various physiological functions, such as diuresis, natriuresis, and blood flow. Recently, abundant evidence shows that NPs and NPRs are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting possible roles of NPs in modulating physiological functions of the CNS. This review starts with a brief summary of relevant background information, such as molecular structures of NPs and NPRs and general intracellular mechanisms after activation of NPRs. We then provide a detailed description of the expression profiles of NPs and NPRs in the CNS and an in-depth discussion of how NPs are involved in neural development, neurotransmitter release, synaptic transmission and neuroprotection through activation of NPRs.","When making intertemporal decisions, i.e., decisions between outcomes occurring at different instants in time, humans and animals prefer rewards with short-term availability over rewards that become available in the long run. Discounted utility theory (DUT) is an influential normative model for intertemporal decisions that attempts to capture preference over time. It prescribes which is the best decision to take with respect to consistent, coherent and optimal choice. Over the last few decades, DUT's descriptive validity has been critically challenged. Empirical studies found systematic violations of several of DUT's assumptions, including time-consistency of preferences, stationarity, constant discounting and utility maximisation. To account for these anomalies, alternative models have been devised in various academic disciplines, including economics, psychology, biology, philosophy, and most lately, cognitive neuroscience. This article reviews the most recent literature on the behavioural and neural processes underlying intertemporal choices, and elucidates to which extent these findings can be used to explain violations of DUT's assumptions. In the first three sections, DUT is introduced, and behavioural anomalies are discussed. The fourth part focuses on the neuroscience of intertemporal choice, including its functional neuroanatomy, attempts to find a discounted value signal in the brain, and recent efforts to identify neural mechanisms producing time-inconsistencies. In the last section, the computational literature on neural learning mechanisms is reviewed. Then, a new, biologically plausible computational model of intertemporal choice is proposed that is able to explain many of the behavioural anomalies. The implications of these results help to understand why humans and animals frequently decide irrationally and to their long-term economic disadvantage, and which neural mechanisms underly such decisions.","Synaptic adhesion molecules are known to participate in various steps of synapse development including initial contacts between dendrites and axons, formation of early synapses, and their maturation and plastic changes. Notably, a significant subset of synaptic adhesion molecules associates with synaptic scaffolding proteins, suggesting that they may act in concert to couple trans-synaptic adhesion to molecular organization of synaptic proteins. Here, we describe an emerging group of synaptic adhesion molecules that directly interact with the abundant postsynaptic scaffold PSD-95, which include neuroligins, NGLs, SALMs, and ADAM22, and discuss how these proteins and PSD-95 act together to regulate synaptic development. PSD-95 may be one of the central organizers of synaptic adhesion that recruits diverse proteins to sites of synaptic adhesion, promotes trans-synaptic signaling, and couples neuronal activity with changes in synaptic adhesion.","Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids, which are enriched in the brain, are important for multiple aspects of neuronal development and function including neurite outgrowth, signal transduction and membrane fluidity. Recent studies show that PUFA are capable of improving hippocampal long-term potentiation, learning ability of aged rats, and cognitive function of humans with memory deficits, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. There have been several reports studying physiological roles of G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) in the pancreas, but no studies have focused on the function of GPR40 in the brain. As GPR40 was recently identified in neurons throughout the brain, it is probable that certain PUFA may act, as endogenous ligands, on GPR40 at their cell surface. However, the effects of PUFA upon neuronal functions are still not clearly understood. Here, although circumferential, a combination of in vitro and in vivo data is introduced to consider the effects of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids on brain functions. GPR40 was found in the newborn neurons of the normal and postischemic hippocampi of adult macaque monkeys, while the positive effects of PUFA upon Ca(2+) mobilization and cognitive functions were demonstrated in both GPR40 gene-transfected PC12 cells and human subjects with memory deficits. The purpose of this review is to propose a putative link among PUFA, GPR40, and hippocampal newborn neurons by discussing whether PUFA can improve memory functions through GPR40 activation of adult-born neurons. At present, little is known about PUFA requirements that make possible neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. However, the idea that 'PUFA-GPR40 interaction might be crucial for adult neurogenesis and/or memory' should be examined in detail using various experimental paradigms.","Chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) have been traditionally defined as small (10-14kDa) secreted leukocyte chemoattractants. However, chemokines and their cognate receptors are constitutively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) where immune activities are under stringent control. Why and how the CNS uses the chemokine system to carry out its complex physiological functions has intrigued neurobiologists. Here, we focus on chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 that have been widely characterized in peripheral tissues and delineate their main functions in the CNS. Extensive evidence supports CXCL12 as a key regulator for early development of the CNS. CXCR4 signaling is required for the migration of neuronal precursors, axon guidance/pathfinding and maintenance of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). In the mature CNS, CXCL12 modulates neurotransmission, neurotoxicity and neuroglial interactions. Thus, chemokines represent an inherent system that helps establish and maintain CNS homeostasis. In addition, growing evidence implicates altered expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in the pathogenesis of CNS disorders such as HIV-associated encephalopathy, brain tumor, stroke and multiple sclerosis (MS), making them the plausible targets for future pharmacological intervention.","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) mediates several classic physiologies including body water and electrolyte homeostasis, blood pressure, cyclicity of reproductive hormones and sexual behaviors, and the regulation of pituitary gland hormones. These functions appear to be mediated by the angiotensin II (AngII)/AT(1) receptor subtype system. More recently, the angiotensin IV (AngIV)/AT(4) receptor subtype system has been implicated in cognitive processing, cerebroprotection, local blood flow, stress, anxiety and depression. There is accumulating evidence to suggest an inhibitory influence by AngII acting at the AT(1) subtype, and a facilitory role by AngIV acting at the AT(4) subtype, on neuronal firing rate, long-term potentiation, associative and spatial learning, and memory. This review initially describes the biochemical pathways that permit synthesis and degradation of active angiotensin peptides and three receptor subtypes (AT(1), AT(2) and AT(4)) thus far characterized. There is vigorous debate concerning the identity of the most recently discovered receptor subtype, AT(4). Descriptions of classic and novel physiologies and behaviors controlled by the RAS are presented. This review concludes with a consideration of the emerging therapeutic applications suggested by these newly discovered functions of the RAS.","There is a current debate whether the human brain possesses a shared representation for various types of magnitude such as numerical quantities, physical size, or loudness. Here, we critically review evidence from chronometric, neuroimaging, developmental and comparative fields, and supplement it with a meta-analysis of the neuroimaging data. Together, based on such an integrative overview, we discuss limitations inherent in each approach, and the possibility whether shared, or distinct magnitude representation, or both representations exist.","Urocortin is a member of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family of peptides. In the brain, its potent suppression of food intake is mediated by CRH receptors (CRHR). Urocortin also participates in the regulation of anxiety, learning, memory, and body temperature, and it shows neuroprotection. This review will summarize the location of urocortin-producing neurons and their projections, the pharmacological evidence of its actions in the CNS, and information acquired from knockout mice. Urocortin interacts with leptin, neuropeptide Y, orexin, and corticotropin in the brain. Also produced by the GI tract, heart, and immune cells, urocortin has blood concentrations ranging from 13 to 152 pg/ml. Blood-borne urocortin stimulates the cerebral endothelial cells composing the blood-brain barrier and crosses the blood-brain barrier by a unique transport system. Overall, urocortin acts on a broad neuronal substrate as a neuromodulator important for basic survival.","The article specifies several important aspects related to the sense of smell in vertebrates. The idea that odors exert effects in the human brain though being not consciously perceived is introduced. Functional aspects related to cross-modal sensory interaction between olfaction and vision are highlighted. In particular, studies making use of electrophysiological methods providing high temporal resolution reveal an early processing stage around 300 ms and a later stage around 700 ms after stimulus onset. The early stage has been associated with subconscious olfactory information processing, whereas the later stage most likely reflects conscious odor perception. Specific interactions are described between olfaction and language and between olfaction and face processing in correlation with both stages of olfactory information processing. A consciously perceived odor can negatively affect language and face processing if these stimuli are presented and associated simultaneously, whereas simultaneous subconscious odor processing has the potential to improve memory formation in other stimulus modalities. Strikingly, the subconscious effect seems not to depend on odor valence. Besides a better understanding of the sense of olfaction itself, these findings on cross-modal integration support the idea that neural representations exist for semantic contents (object meaning) independent from particular sensory modalities. These representations can be referred to as meta representations because the information they contain is derived from a great variety of sensory information integrated into a semantic representation of an object. It is suggested that such meta representations represent the basic units for cognition and that they provide inputs during dreaming.","Studies of human seizure disorders have revealed that susceptibility to seizures is greatly influenced by genetic factors. In addition to causing epilepsy, genetic factors can suppress seizures and epileptogenesis. Examination of seizure-suppressor genes is challenging in humans. However, such genes are readily identified and analyzed in a Drosophila animal model of epilepsy. In this article, the epilepsy phenotype of Drosophila seizure-sensitive mutants is reviewed. A novel class of genes called seizure-suppressors is described. Mutations defining suppressors revert the ""epilepsy"" phenotype of neurological mutants. We conclude this review with particular discussion of a seizure-suppressor gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I (top1). Mutations of top1 are especially effective at reverting the seizure-sensitive phenotype of Drosophila epilepsy mutants. In addition, an unexpected class of anti-epileptic drugs has been identified. These are DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors such as camptothecin and its derivatives; several candidates are comparable or perhaps better than traditional anti-epileptic drugs such as valproate at reducing seizures in Drosophila drug-feeding experiments.","Vasopressin (Avp) is mainly synthesized in the magnocellular cells of the hypothalamic supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) whose axons project to the posterior pituitary. Avp is then released into the blood stream upon appropriate stimulation (e.g., hemorrhage or dehydration) to act at the kidneys and blood vessels. The brain also contains several populations of smaller, parvocellular neurons whose projections remain within the brain. These populations are located within the PVN, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), medial amygdala (MeA) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Since the 1950s, research examining the roles of Avp in the brain and periphery has intensified. The development of specific agonists and antagonists for Avp receptors has allowed for a better elucidation of its contributions to physiology and behavior. Anatomical, pharmacological and transgenic, including ""knockout,"" animal studies have implicated Avp in the regulation of various social behaviors across species. Avp plays a prominent role in the regulation of aggression, generally of facilitating or promoting it. Affiliation and certain aspects of pair-bonding are also influenced by Avp. Memory, one of the first brain functions of Avp that was investigated, has been implicated especially strongly in social recognition. The roles of Avp in stress, anxiety, and depressive states are areas of active exploration. In this review, we concentrate on the scientific progress that has been made in understanding the role of Avp in regulating these and other behaviors across species. We also discuss the implications for human behavior.","Symptomatic medications, l-Dopa and dopaminergic agents, remain the only clinically pertinent pharmacological treatment proven effective and available for the large population of patients with Parkinson's disease. The challenge for the pharmaceutical industry is to develop disease-modifying drugs which could arrest, delay or at least oppose the progression of the specific pathogenic processes underlying Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this review, based on recent biological and genetic data to be validated with appropriate animal models, was to re-examine the putative neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease and discuss the development of new strategies with the ultimate goal of demonstrating neurocytoprotective activity in this neurodegenerative disease. Since guidelines for research on neurocytoprotective drugs remain to be written, innovation will be the key to success of future clinical trials. It is reasonable to expect that future advances in our understanding of the pathogenic processes of Parkinson's disease will open the way to new perspectives for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases.","Enzymatically derived NO and extracellular ATP are receiving greater attention due to their role as messengers in the CNS during different physiological and pathological processes. Ionotropic (P2XR) and metabotropic (P2YR) purinergic receptors mediate ATP effects and are present throughout the body. Particularly P2XR are crucial for brain plasticity mechanisms, and are involved in the pathogenesis of different CNS illnesses. NO does not have a specific receptor and its actions are directly dependent on the production on demand by different nitric oxide synthase isoforms. NO synthesizing enzymes are present virtually in all tissues, and NO influences multifarious physiological and pathological functions. Interestingly, various are the tissue and organs modulated by both ATP and NO, such as the immune, brain and vascular systems. Moreover, direct interactions between purinergic and nitrergic mechanisms outside the CNS are well documented, with several studies also indicating that ATP and NO do participate to the same CNS functions. In the past few years, further experimental evidence supported the physiological and pathological relevance of ATP and NO direct interactions in the CNS. The aim of the present review is to provide an account of the available information on the interplay between purinergic and nitrergic systems, focussing on the CNS. The already established relevance of ATP and NO in different pathological processes would predict that the knowledge of ATP/NO cross-talk mechanisms would support pharmacological approaches toward the development of novel ATP/NO combined pharmacological agents.","Obesity reflects an imbalance between energy uptake and expenditure that is mediated by behavior. Obesity is a growing epidemic and a major risk factor for neurobiological diseases like stroke, dementia, intracranial hypertension and sleep disorders. Conversely, obesity can also be induced by neurobiological disorders and drugs. The etiology of obesity is complex and includes biology, behavior and environment. Physicians are faced with the need to manage obesity while strategies for prevention and sustained weight reduction are limited. Present treatment options comprise lifestyle modification, diet, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. Considerable headway has been made into elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of obesogenic behavior. There is now a growing understanding of the metabolic, hormonal and behavioral circuitries that contribute to the complex and redundant system for energy balance. Changing the net balance of this system to prevent or reduce obesity requires multimodal and long-term interventions.",Brain hypoxia-ischemia is a relatively common and serious problem in neonates and in adults. Its consequences include long-term histological and behavioral changes and reduction in seizure threshold. Gap junction intercellular communication is pivotal in the spread of hypoxia-ischemia related injury and in mediating its long-term effects. This review provides a comprehensive and critical review of hypoxia-ischemia and hypoxia in the brain and the potential role of gap junctions in the spread of the neuronal injury induced by these insults. It also presents the effects of hypoxia-ischemia and of hypoxia on the state of gap junctions in vitro and in vivo. Understanding the mechanisms involved in gap junction-mediated neuronal injury due to hypoxia will lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.,"N-myristoylation is a co-translational, irreversible addition of a fatty acyl moiety to the amino terminus of many eukaryotic cellular proteins. These myristoylated proteins in the cell have diverse biological functions such as signal transduction, cellular transformation and oncogensis. Known myristoylated proteins [Src family kinases, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin (CaN)] are either protein kinases or a protein phosphatases which modulate various cellular metabolic processes. Myristoylation is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) and is recognized to be a widespread and functionally important modification of proteins. The main objective of this review is to focus on the potential role of NMT and CaN in epileptic brain and its involvement in neuronal apoptosis. The findings on the interaction of NMT and CaN with various signaling molecules in epileptic chickens adds to our understanding of the mechanism of CaN signaling in neuronal apoptosis. Understanding the regulation of NMT by specific inhibitors may help us to control the action of this enzyme on its specific substrates and may lead to improvements in the management of various neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, ischemia and epilepsy.","This review summarizes recent developments that have contributed to understand how adenosine receptors, particularly A2A receptors, modulate brain injury in various animal models of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and HIV-associated dementia. It is clear that extracellular adenosine acting at adenosine receptors influences the functional outcome in a broad spectrum of brain injuries, indicating that A2A Rs may modulate some general cellular processes to affect neuronal cells death. Pharmacological, neurochemical and molecular/genetic approaches to the complex actions of A2A receptors in different cellular elements suggest that A2A receptor activation can be detrimental or protective after brain insults, depending on the nature of brain injury and associated pathological conditions. An interesting concept that emerges from these studies is A2A R's ability to fine tune neuronal and glial functions to produce neuroprotective effects. While the data presented here clearly highlight the complexity of using adenosinergic agents therapeutically in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders and point out many areas for further inquiry, they also confirm that adenosine receptor ligands, particularly A2A receptor ligands, have many promising characteristics that encourage the pursuit of their therapeutic potential.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2007.10.002 PMCID: PMC2147722 PMID: 17997007  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"The progression and outcome of stroke is affected by the intricate relationship between the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). TNFalpha crosses the intact BBB by a receptor-mediated transport system that is upregulated by CNS trauma and inflammation. In this review, we discuss intracellular trafficking and transcytosis of TNFalpha, regulation of TNFalpha transport after stroke, and the effects of TNFalpha on stroke preconditioning. TNFalpha can activate cytoprotective pathways by pretreatment or persistent exposure to low doses. This explains the paradoxical observation that transport of this proinflammatory cytokine improves the survival and function of hypoxic cells and of mice with stroke. The dual effects of TNFalpha may be related to differential regulation of TNFalpha trafficking downstream to TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors. As we better understand how peripheral TNFalpha affects its own transport and modulates neuroregeneration, we may be in a better position to pharmacologically manipulate its regulatory transport system to treat stroke.","Identifying factors that may increase the risk of stroke and assessing if treatment of such conditions may lower that risk are important in the management of cerebrovascular disease. Tobacco smoking, poor diet, hypertension and hyperlipidemia remain the major risk factors, and treatment of these conditions has been shown to significantly reduce stroke. In recent years, research has shown that stem cells from a variety of sources can be used as a tool to study and prevent the events that lead to stroke. In this regard, a population of adult stem cells, called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), have been identified in peripheral blood and may play an important role in tissue vascularization and endothelium homeostasis in the adult. Most of the studies on EPCs have been carried out on patients with cardiovascular diseases; however, there is emerging evidence which suggests that the introduction or mobilization of EPCs can restore tissue vascularization even after cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), such as ischemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. In this review, we discuss the present level of knowledge about the characteristics of EPCs, their possible therapeutic role in CVD and how they could alter clinical practice in the future.","Physiological brain aging is characterized by a loss of synaptic contacts and neuronal apoptosis that provokes age-dependent decline of sensory processing, motor performance, and cognitive function. Neural redundancy and plastic remodelling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modern neurophysiological techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index normal and abnormal brain aging to facilitate non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies. The present review provides a perspective of these issues by assaying different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results with functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, with applications at the individual level also suggested. Integrated approaches utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost and non-invasive evaluation of at-risk populations. Practical implications of the methods are emphasized.","Adenosine A2A receptors have a unique cellular and regional distribution in the basal ganglia, being particularly concentrated in areas richly innervated by dopamine such as the caudate-putamen and the globus pallidus. Adenosine A2A receptors are selectively located on striatopallidal neurons and are capable of forming functional heteromeric complexes with dopamine D2 and metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 receptors. Based on the unique cellular and regional distribution of this receptor and in line with data showing that A2A receptor antagonists improve motor symptoms in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and in initial clinical trials, A2A receptor antagonists have emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target to improve the motor deficits that characterize PD. Experimental data have also shown that A2A receptor antagonists do not induce neuroplasticity phenomena that complicate long-term dopaminergic treatments. The present review provides an updated summary of results reported in the literature concerning the biochemical characteristics and basal ganglia distribution of A2A receptors. We subsequently aim to examine the effects of adenosine A2A antagonists in rodent and primate models of PD and of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Finally, concluding remarks are made on post-mortem human brains and on the translation of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in the treatment of PD.","Many of our current hopes of finding better ways to treat Parkinson's disease or to stop its progression rely on studies of adenosine A2A receptors in the brain. Yet any drug targeting central receptors will also potentially affect receptors in other sites. Furthermore, several fundamental aspects of adenosine receptor biology must be taken into account. For these reasons the ""Targeting adenosine A2A receptors in Parkinson's disease and other CNS disorders"" meeting in Boston included selected aspects of the general biology of adenosine A2A receptor signaling. Some of the presentations from this part of the meeting are summarized in this first chapter. As will be apparent to the reader, these different parts do not form an integrated whole, but they do indicate areas the organizers felt might illuminate remaining questions regarding the roles of adenosine A2A receptors. The contributors to this part of the meeting have summarized some of the key questions below.","Adenosine A2A receptors are highly enriched in the basal ganglia system. They are predominantly expressed in enkephalin-expressing GABAergic striatopallidal neurons and therefore are highly relevant to the function of the indirect efferent pathway of the basal ganglia system. In these GABAergic enkephalinergic neurons, the A2A receptor tightly interacts structurally and functionally with the dopamine D2 receptor. Both by forming receptor heteromers and by targeting common intracellular signaling cascades, A2A and D2 receptors exhibit reciprocal antagonistic interactions that are central to the function of the indirect pathway and hence to basal ganglia control of movement, motor learning, motivation and reward. Consequently, this A2A/D2 receptors antagonistic interaction is also central to basal ganglia dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. However, recent evidence demonstrates that, in addition to this post-synaptic site of action, striatal A2A receptors are also expressed and have physiological relevance on pre-synaptic glutamatergic terminals of the cortico-limbic-striatal and thalamo-striatal pathways, where they form heteromeric receptor complexes with adenosine A1 receptors. Therefore, A2A receptors play an important fine-tuning role, boosting the efficiency of glutamatergic information flow in the indirect pathway by exerting control, either pre- and/or post-synaptically, over other key modulators of glutamatergic synapses, including D2 receptors, group I metabotropic mGlu5 glutamate receptors and cannabinoid CB1 receptors, and by triggering the cAMP-protein kinase A signaling cascade.","Adenosine A2A receptors localized in the dorsal striatum are considered as a new target for the development of antiparkinsonian drugs. Co-administration of A2A receptor antagonists has shown a significant improvement of the effects of l-DOPA. The present review emphasizes the possible application of A2A receptor antagonists in pathological conditions other than parkinsonism, including drug addiction, sleep disorders and pain. In addition to the dorsal striatum, the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) contains a high density of A2A receptors, which presynaptically and postsynaptically regulate glutamatergic transmission in the cortical glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens. It is currently believed that molecular adaptations of the cortico-accumbens glutamatergic synapses are involved in compulsive drug seeking and relapse. Here we review recent experimental evidence suggesting that A2A antagonists could become new therapeutic agents for drug addiction. Morphological and functional studies have identified lower levels of A2A receptors in brain areas other than the striatum, such as the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, where adenosine plays an important role in sleep regulation. Although initially believed to be mostly dependent on A1 receptors, here we review recent studies that demonstrate that the somnogenic effects of adenosine are largely mediated by hypothalamic A2A receptors. A2A)receptor antagonists could therefore be considered as a possible treatment for narcolepsy and other sleep-related disorders. Finally, nociception is another adenosine-regulated neural function previously thought to mostly involve A1 receptors. Although there is some conflicting literature on the effects of agonists and antagonists, which may partly be due to the lack of selectivity of available drugs, the studies in A2A receptor knockout mice suggest that A2A receptor antagonists might have some therapeutic potential in pain states, in particular where high intensity stimuli are prevalent.","The ways in which gene transcription is investigated have undergone radical change since the turn of the millennium. Piece-meal approaches focussed upon model genes have increasingly been complemented by genome-wide approaches that allow interrogation of multiple cohorts of genes or even entire genomes. This sea change has been founded upon the increasing availability of whole genome sequences and the attendant evolution of microarray based discovery platforms. Collectively, these approaches are being used to build a global and dynamic perspective of transcription factor occupancy, co-factor recruitment and epigenetic signature. As yet, few of these approaches have been applied to the study of neuronal gene transcription, but this is set to change. Here, I review these key developments and point to their potential application to the study of transcriptional and epigenetic changes in neurons in health and disease.",DOI: 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2007.07.003 PMID: 17706859  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"While selective neuronal death has been an influential theme in Huntington's disease (HD), there is now a preponderance of evidence that significant neuronal dysfunction precedes frank neuronal death. The best evidence for neuronal dysfunction is the observation that gene expression is altered in HD brain, suggesting that transcriptional dysregulation is a central mechanism. Studies of altered gene expression began with careful observations of postmortem human HD brain and subsequently were accelerated by the development of transgenic mouse models. The application of DNA microarray technology has spurred tremendous progress with respect to the altered transcriptional processes that occur in HD, through gene expression studies of both transgenic mouse models as well as cellular models of HD. Gene expression profiles are remarkably comparable across these models, bolstering the idea that transcriptional signatures reflect an essential feature of disease pathogenesis. Finally, gene expression studies have been applied to human HD, thus not only validating the approach of using model systems, but also solidifying the idea that altered transcription is a key mechanism in HD pathogenesis. In the future, gene expression profiling will be used as a readout in clinical trials aimed at correcting transcriptional dysregulation in Huntington's disease.","Transcriptional dysregulation in Huntington's disease (HD) is a well documented and broadly studied phenomenon. Its basis appears to be in huntingtin's aberrant protein-protein interactions with a variety of transcription factors. The development of therapeutics targeting altered transcription, however, faces serious challenges. No single transcriptional regulator has emerged as a primary actor in HD. The levels of literally hundreds of RNA transcripts are altered in affected cells and it is uncertain which are most relevant. The protein-protein interactions of mutant huntingtin with transcriptional factors do not constitute conventional and easy targets for drug molecules. Nevertheless, potential therapeutic advances, targeting transcriptional deregulation in HD, have been made in recent years. In this chapter we review current progress in this area of therapeutic development. We also discuss possible drug discovery strategies targeting altered transcriptional pathways.","There are nine genetic neurodegenerative diseases caused by a similar genetic defect, a CAG DNA triplet-repeat expansion in the disease gene's open reading frame resulting in a polyglutamine expansion in the disease proteins. Despite the commonality of polyglutamine expansion, each of the polyglutamine diseases manifest as unique diseases, with some similarities, but important differences. These differences suggest that the context of the polyglutamine expansion is important to the mechanism of pathology of the disease proteins. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly paramount to understand the normal functions of these polyglutamine disease proteins, which include huntingtin, the polyglutamine-expanded protein in Huntington's disease (HD). Transcriptional dysregulation is seen in HD. Here we discuss the role of normal huntingtin in transcriptional regulation and misregulation in Huntington's disease in relation to potentially analogous model systems, and to other polyglutamine disease proteins. Huntingtin has functional roles in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. One commonality of activity of polyglutamine disease proteins is at the level of protein dynamics and ability to import and export to and from the nucleus. Knowing the temporal location of huntingtin protein in response to signaling and neuronal communication could lead to valuable insights into an important trigger of HD pathology.","Extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) that confers neurotoxicity and modulates synaptic plasticity and memory function has been central to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Like many other misfolded proteins identified in neurodegenerative disorders, Abeta also accumulates inside the AD neurons. This intracellular Abeta affects a variety of cellular physiology from protein degradation, axonal transport, autophagy to apoptosis, further documenting the role of Abeta in AD. Therapeutics targeting intracellular Abeta could be effective treatment for AD.","New findings obtained during the past years, especially the discovery of mutations in the genes associated with brain iron metabolism, have provided key insights into the homeostatic mechanisms of brain iron metabolism and the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that misregulation in brain iron metabolism is one of the initial causes for neuronal death in some neurodegenerative disorders. The errors in brain iron metabolism found in these disorders have a multifactorial pathogenesis, including genetic and nongenetic factors. The disturbances of iron metabolism might occur at multiple levels, including iron uptake and release, storage, intracellular metabolism and regulation. It is the increased brain iron that triggers a cascade of deleterious events, leading to neuronal death in these diseases. In the article, the recent advances in studies on neurochemistry and neuropathophysiology of brain iron metabolism were reviewed.","Cerebral vascular system can be divided into two categories: the macrovessels and microvessels. The microvessels consist of arterioles, capillaries and venules. There are three basic components in the microvasculature: endothelial cells, basal lamina and end-feet of astrocytes. The basal lamina is situated between the endothelial cells and the end-feet of astrocytes, and connects these two layers together. Damage to the basal lamina causes the dismantlement of microvascular wall structures, which in turn results in increase of microvascular permeability, hemorrhagic transformation, brain edema and compromise of the microcirculation. The present article reviews microvascular changes during ischemic brain injury, with emphasis on basal lamina damage.","Axon degeneration is an active, tightly controlled and versatile process of axon segment self-destruction. Although not involving cell death, it resembles apoptosis in its logics. It involves three distinct steps: induction of competence in specific neurons, triggering of degeneration at defined axon segments of competent neurons, and rapid fragmentation and removal of the segments. The mechanisms that initiate degeneration are specific to individual settings, but the final pathway of pruning is shared; it involves microtubule disassembly, axon swellings, axon fragmentation, and removal of the remnants by locally recruited phagocytes. The tight regulatory properties of axon degeneration distinguish it from passive loss phenomena, and confer significance to processes that involve it. Axon degeneration has prominent roles in development, upon lesions and in disease. In development, it couples the progressive specification of neurons and circuits to the removal of defined axon branches. Competence might involve transcriptional switches, and local triggering can involve axon guidance molecules and synaptic activity patterns. Lesion-induced Wallerian degeneration is inhibited in the presence of Wld(S) fusion protein in neurons; it involves early local, and later, distal degeneration. It has recently become clear that like in other settings, axon degeneration in disease is a rapid and specific process, which should not be confused with a variety of disease-related pathologies. Elucidating the specific mechanisms that initiate axon degeneration should open up new avenues to investigate principles of circuit assembly and plasticity, to uncover mechanisms of disease progression, and to identify ways of protecting synapses and axons in disease.","Research on the regulation and function of ascending noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic systems has focused on the organization and function of individual systems. In contrast, evidence describing co-activation and interactions between multiple neuromodulatory systems has remained scarce. However, commonalities in the anatomical organization of these systems and overlapping evidence concerning the post-synaptic effects of neuromodulators strongly suggest that these systems are recruited in concert; they influence each other and simultaneously modulate their target circuits. Therefore, evidence on the regulatory and functional interactions between these systems is considered essential for revealing the role of neuromodulators. This postulate extends to contemporary neurobiological hypotheses of major neuropsychiatric disorders. These hypotheses have focused largely on aberrations in the integrity or regulation of individual ascending modulatory systems, with little regard for the likely possibility that dysregulation in multiple ascending neuromodulatory systems and their interactions contribute essentially to the symptoms of these disorders. This review will paradigmatically focus on neuromodulator interactions in the PFC and be further constrained by an additional focus on their role in cognitive functions. Recent evidence indicates that individual neuromodulators, in addition to their general state-setting or gating functions, encode specific cognitive operations, further substantiating the importance of research concerning the parallel recruitment of neuromodulator systems and interactions between these systems.","The year 2006 marks the centenary of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine awarded to Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Camilo Golgi, ""in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system"". Their discoveries are keys to understanding the present neuroscience, for instance, the discovery of dendritic spines. Cajal discovered dendritic spines in 1888 with the Golgi method, although other contemporary scientists thought that they were silver precipitates. Dendritic spines were demonstrated definitively as real structures by Cajal with the Methylene Blue in 1896. Many of the observations of Cajal and other contemporary scientists about dendritic spines are active fields of research of present neuroscience, for instance, their morphology, distribution, density, development and function. This article will deal with the main contributions of Cajal and other contemporary scientists about dendritic spines. We will analyse their contributions from the historical and present point of view. In addition, we will show high quality images of Cajal's original preparations and drawings related with this discovery.","The extracellular accumulation of glutamate and the excessive activation of glutamate receptors, in particular N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal cell death associated with chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Findings are reviewed indicating that the tridecaptide neurotensin (NT) via activation of NT receptor subtype 1 (NTS1) promotes and reinforces endogenous glutamate signalling in discrete brain regions. The increase of striatal, nigral and cortical glutamate outflow by NT and the enhancement of NMDA receptor function by a NTS1/NMDA interaction that involves the activation of protein kinase C may favour the depolarization of NTS1 containing neurons and the entry of calcium. These results strengthen the hypothesis that NT may be involved in the amplification of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in mesencephalic dopamine and cortical neurons. The mechanisms involved may include also antagonistic NTS1/D2 interactions in the cortico-striatal glutamate terminals and in the nigral DA cell bodies and dendrites as well as in the nigro-striatal DA terminals. The possible increase in NT levels in the basal ganglia under pathological conditions leading to the NTS1 enhancement of glutamate signalling may contribute to the neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons found in Parkinson's disease, especially in view of the high density of NTS1 receptors in these neurons. The use of selective NTS1 antagonists together with conventional drug treatments could provide a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of Parkinson's disease.","Here, we discuss the identity, heterogeneity and functions of radial glial cells mostly in the developing central nervous system (CNS). First, we define radial glial cells by morphological, cell biological and molecular criteria as true glial cells, akin to astroglia. We then describe the appearance of radial glial cells during neural development as a precursor intermediate between immature neuroepithelial cells and differentiating progeny. Then we review the diverse progeny arising in different lineages from radial glial cells as observed by clonal analyses and time-lapse imaging. This leads us to discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the lineage heterogeneity of radial glial cells - including their diversity in distinct regions of the CNS. We conclude by considering the possible mechanisms allowing neurogenic radial glial cells to persist into adulthood in various vertebrate classes ranging from fish to birds, while neurogenic glial cells become restricted to few small regions of the adult forebrain in mice and men.","A fundamental feature of neural development in vertebrates is that different cell types are generated in a precise temporal sequence, first neurons, followed by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The mechanisms underlying these remarkable changes in progenitor fate during development are not well understood, but are thought to include both changes in the intrinsic properties of neural progenitors and changes in their signaling environment. I discuss the mechanisms that control the specification of neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial fates, focusing on the mammalian telencephalon, one of the most extensively used models to study neural specification mechanisms in vertebrates. I first consider the multiple extracellular signals that have been implicated in neural fate specification. Their roles are often complex, with the same signals having different effects at different developmental stages, and different signaling pathways interacting extensively. The selection of a particular cell fate ultimately results from the integration of multiple signals. Signaling pathways regulate cell fates by modulating the expression and activity of numerous transcription factors in neural stem cells. I discuss how transcription factors also act in a combinatorial manner to determine progenitor fates, with individual factors promoting the generation of one or two cell types and repressing alternative fate(s). Finally, I discuss the many levels of regulation involved in preventing premature astrocyte differentiation during neurogenesis, and later on in controlling the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis.","During mammalian neurogenesis newly born neurons migrate radially along the extended bipolar process of cells termed radial glia. Our views of radial glia as a 'static' support/guide cell have changed over recent years. It is now clear that within the developing cortex, and possibly the entire central nervous system (CNS), radial glia actively divide, producing daughter cells that include both neurons and glia. A subset of forebrain radial glia may serve as the founders of adult forebrain neural stem cells and genetic disruption of normal radial glia function can result in tumorigenesis or congenital neurological disorders. Elucidating the cell intrinsic and environmental cues that regulate radial glia behaviour is therefore essential for a full understanding of mammalian CNS development and physiology. Here, we review those studies in which radial glia have been investigated in vitro following isolation from foetal tissues or differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. We discuss how these approaches, together with an ability to expand radial glia-like neural stem (NS) cell lines, may offer unique opportunities in basic and applied neurobiology.","Adult neurogenesis persists within restricted areas of the mammalian brain, giving rise prevalently to neuronal precursors that integrate inside the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. The source of this continuous cell production consists of neural stem cells which have been identified as elements of the astroglial lineage. This counterintuitive finding overlaps with the recent discovery that embryonic radial glia can themselves act as stem cells, capable of producing both neurons and glia during development. Although radial glia was thought to disappear early postnatally at the end of neurogenesis by transformation into parenchymal astrocytes, it has recently been demonstrated that some radial glial cells somehow persist within the adult forebrain subventricular zone, hidden among astrocytes of the glial tubes. This transformation occurs in parallel with overall morphological and molecular changes within the neurogenic site, whose specific steps, mechanisms, and outcomes are not yet fully understood. The modified radial glia appear to be neural progenitor cells belonging to the astroglial lineage (type B cells) assuring both stem cell self-renewal and production of a differentiated progeny in the adult subventricular zone, and also playing regulatory roles in stem cell niche maintenance.","The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger is a bi-directional electrogenic (3Na(+):1Ca(2+)) and voltage-sensitive ion transport mechanism, which is mainly responsible for Ca(2+)-extrusion. The Na(+)-gradient, required for normal mode operation, is created by the Na(+)-pump, which is also electrogenic (3Na(+):2K(+)) and voltage-sensitive. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger operational modes are very similar to those of the Na(+)-pump, except that the uncoupled flux (Na(+)-influx or -efflux?) is missing. The reversal potential of the exchanger is around -40 mV; therefore, during the upstroke of the AP it is probably transiently activated, leading to Ca(2+)-influx. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange is regulated by transported and non-transported external and internal cations, and shows ATP(i)-, pH- and temperature-dependence. The main problem in determining the role of Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange in excitation-secretion/contraction coupling is the lack of specific (mode-selective) blockers. During recent years, evidence has been accumulated for co-localisation of the Na(+)-pump, and the Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger and their possible functional interaction in the ""restricted"" or ""fuzzy space."" In cardiac failure, the Na(+)-pump is down-regulated, while the exchanger is up-regulated. If the exchanger is working in normal mode (Ca(2+)-extrusion) during most of the cardiac cycle, upregulation of the exchanger may result in SR Ca(2+)-store depletion and further impairment in contractility. If so, a normal mode selective Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange inhibitor would be useful therapy for decompensation, and unlike CGs would not increase internal Na(+). In peripheral sympathetic nerves, pre-synaptic alpha(2)-receptors may regulate not only the VSCCs but possibly the reverse Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange as well.","Considering the multi-etiological character of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the current pharmacological approaches using drugs oriented towards a single molecular target possess limited ability to modify the course of the disease and thus, offer a partial benefit to the patient. In line with this concept, novel strategies include the use of a cocktail of several drugs and/or the development of a single molecule, possessing two or more active neuroprotective-neurorescue moieties that simultaneously manipulate multiple targets involved in AD pathology. A consistent observation in AD is a dysregulation of metal ions (Fe(2+), Cu(2+) and Zn(2+)) homeostasis and consequential induction of oxidative stress, associated with beta-amyloid aggregation and neurite plaque formation. In particular, iron has been demonstrated to modulate the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor holo-protein expression by a pathway similar to that of ferritin L-and H-mRNA translation through iron-responsive elements in their 5'UTRs. This review will discuss two separate scenarios concerning multiple therapy targets in AD, sharing in common the implementation of iron chelation activity: (i) novel multimodal brain-permeable iron chelating drugs, possessing neuroprotective-neurorescue and amyloid precursor protein-processing regulatory activities; (ii) natural plant polyphenols (flavonoids), such as green tea epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin, reported to have access to the brain and to possess multifunctional activities, such as metal chelation-radical scavenging, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection.","During infancy and early childhood, children develop their ability to regulate their own emotions and behavior. This development of self-regulatory mechanisms has been considered to be the crucial link between genetic predisposition, early experience, and later adult functioning in society. This paper brings together the updated empirical findings related to the role of attention and the maturation of brain frontal areas in self-regulation. It reviews viewpoints and evidence of disciplines such as developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and neurobiology. It examines the causes of individual differences in self-regulation and the effects of those differences on the social and academic functioning of the individual. The consequences of failure in self-regulation are illustrated by focusing on the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including a detailed review of the animal models related to this disorder. Finally, some initial evidence suggesting the possibility of fostering self-regulation through training of attention is presented.","In mammals, an internal timekeeping mechanism located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) orchestrates a diverse array of neuroendocrine and physiological parameters to anticipate the cyclical environmental fluctuations that occur every solar day. Electrophysiological recording techniques have proved invaluable in shaping our understanding of how this endogenous clock becomes synchronized to salient environmental cues and appropriately coordinates the timing of a multitude of physiological rhythms in other areas of the brain and body. In this review we discuss the pioneering studies that have shaped our understanding of how this biological pacemaker functions, from input to output. Further, we highlight insights from new studies indicating that, more than just reflecting its oscillatory output, electrical activity within individual clock cells is a vital part of SCN clockwork itself.","Injuries to the peripheral nerves result in partial or total loss of motor, sensory and autonomic functions conveyed by the lesioned nerves to the denervated segments of the body, due to the interruption of axons continuity, degeneration of nerve fibers distal to the lesion and eventual death of axotomized neurons. Injuries to the peripheral nervous system may thus result in considerable disability. After axotomy, neuronal phenotype switches from a transmitter to a regenerative state, inducing the down- and up-regulation of numerous cellular components as well as the synthesis de novo of some molecules normally not expressed in adult neurons. These changes in gene expression activate and regulate the pathways responsible for neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by three neural mechanisms: the reinnervation of denervated targets by regeneration of injured axons, the reinnervation by collateral branching of undamaged axons, and the remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of specificity in target reinnervation; plasticity in human has, however, limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, such as neuropathic pain, hyperreflexia and dystonia. Recent research has uncovered that peripheral nerve injuries induce a concurrent cascade of events, at the systemic, cellular and molecular levels, initiated by the nerve injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem relay nuclei, thalamus and brain cortex. Mechanisms for these changes are ubiquitous in central substrates and include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory connections, atrophy and degeneration of normal substrates, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of somatosensory and motor maps. An important direction for ongoing research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, but are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying those positive adaptive changes that help to improve functional recovery but also diminishing undesirable consequences.","Histamine, a ubiquitous aminergic messenger throughout the body, also serves as a neurotransmitter in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In particular, the photoreceptors of adult arthropods use histamine, modulating its release to signal increases and decreases in light intensity. Strong evidence from various arthropod species indicates that histamine is synthesized and stored in photoreceptors, undergoes Ca-dependent release, inhibits postsynaptic interneurons by gating Cl channels, and is then recycled. In Drosophila, the synthetic enzyme, histidine decarboxylase, and the subunits of the histamine-gated chloride channel have been cloned. Possible histamine transporters at synaptic vesicles and for reuptake remain elusive. Indeed, the mechanisms that remove histamine from the synaptic cleft, and that help terminate histamine's action, are unexpectedly complex, their details remaining unresolved. A major pathway in Drosophila, and possibly other arthropod species, is by conjugation of histamine to beta-alanine to form carcinine in adjacent glia. This conjugate then returns to the photoreceptors where it is hydrolysed to liberate histamine, which is then loaded into synaptic vesicles. Evidence from other species suggests that direct reuptake of histamine into the photoreceptors may also occur. Light depolarizes the photoreceptors, causing histamine release and postsynaptic inhibition; dimming hyperpolarizes the photoreceptors, causing a decrease in histamine release and an ""off"" response in the postsynaptic cell. Further pursuit of histamine's action at these highly specialized synapses should lead to an understanding of how they signal minute changes in presynaptic membrane potential, how they reliably extract signals from noise, and how they adapt to a wide range of presynaptic membrane potentials.","As a group, Semaphorins are expressed in most tissues and this distribution varies considerably with age. Semaphorins are dynamically expressed during embryonic development and their expression is often associated with growing axons. This expression decreases with maturity and several observations support the idea that in adult brain the expression of secreted Semaphorins is sensitive to electrical activity and experience. The functional role of Semaphorins in guiding axonal projections is well established and more recent evidence points to additional roles in the development, function and reorganization of synaptic complexes. Semaphorins exert the majority of their effects by binding to cognate receptor proteins through their extracellular domains. A common theme is that Semaphorin-triggered signalling induces the rearrangement of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Mutations in Semaphorin genes are linked to several human diseases associated with neurological changes, but their actual influence in the pathogenesis of these diseases remains to be demonstrated. In addition, Semaphorins and their receptors are likely to mediate cross-talk between neurons and other cell types, including in pathological situations where their influence can be damaging or favourable depending on the context. We discuss how the manipulation of Semaphorin function might be crucial for future clinical studies.","Marsupials are a diverse group of mammals that occupy a large range of habitats and have evolved a wide array of unique adaptations. Although they are as diverse as placental mammals, our understanding of marsupial brain organization is more limited. Like placental mammals, marsupials have striking similarities in neocortical organization, such as a constellation of cortical fields including S1, S2, V1, V2, and A1, that are functionally, architectonically, and connectionally distinct. In this review, we describe the general lifestyle and morphological characteristics of all marsupials and the organization of somatosensory, motor, visual, and auditory cortex. For each sensory system, we compare the functional organization and the corticocortical and thalamocortical connections of the neocortex across species. Differences between placental and marsupial species are discussed and the theories on neocortical evolution that have been derived from studying marsupials, particularly the idea of a sensorimotor amalgam, are evaluated. Overall, marsupials inhabit a variety of niches and assume many different lifestyles. For example, marsupials occupy terrestrial, arboreal, burrowing, and aquatic environments; some animals are highly social while others are solitary; different species are carnivorous, herbivorous, or omnivorous. For each of these adaptations, marsupials have evolved an array of morphological, behavioral, and cortical specializations that are strikingly similar to those observed in placental mammals occupying similar habitats, which indicate that there are constraints imposed on evolving nervous systems that result in recurrent solutions to similar environmental challenges.","Enormous progress has been made in our understanding of adaptive plasticity in the central auditory system. Experiments on a range of species demonstrate that, in adults, the animal must attend to (i.e., respond to) a stimulus in order for plasticity to be induced, and the plasticity that is induced is specific for the acoustic feature to which the animal has attended. The requirement that an adult animal must attend to a stimulus in order for adaptive plasticity to occur suggests an essential role of neuromodulatory systems in gating plasticity in adults. Indeed, neuromodulators, particularly acetylcholine (ACh), that are associated with the processes of attention, have been shown to enable adaptive plasticity in adults. In juvenile animals, attention may facilitate plasticity, but it is not always required: during sensitive periods, mere exposure of an animal to an atypical auditory environment can result in large functional changes in certain auditory circuits. Thus, in both the developing and mature auditory systems substantial experience-dependent plasticity can occur, but the conditions under which it occurs are far more stringent in adults. We review experimental results that demonstrate experience-dependent plasticity in the central auditory representations of sound frequency, level and temporal sequence, as well as in the representations of binaural localization cues in both developing and adult animals.","The master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus in the brain regulates circadian rhythms in mammals. Similar circadian oscillators have been found in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, intestine and retina. Life span has been previously linked independently to both circadian rhythms and caloric restriction (CR). The mechanisms by which CR attenuates ageing and extends life span are virtually unknown. It has recently been found that the alphaMUPA mice, transgenic mice that exhibit spontaneously reduced eating and live longer compared to their FVB/N wild-type control mice, show high amplitude, appropriately reset circadian rhythms. These pronounced rhythms were found both in clock gene expression in the liver and clock-controlled output systems, such as feeding time and body temperature. Furthermore, it was previously shown that CR could reset the central biological clock in the SCN. As the circadian clock in the SCN controls many physiological and biochemical systems, we suggest that appropriately reset peripheral rhythms could constitute an important mediator of longevity in calorically restricted animals. Thus, we suggest that three parameters, i.e., caloric restriction, circadian rhythms and life span, are interconnected. This surmise is novel, and we provide evidence to support it. Furthermore, we discuss other feeding regimens and their effects on circadian rhythms and/or life span.","The lineages of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes have been popular areas of research in the last decade. The source of these cells in the mature CNS is relevant to the study of the cellular response to CNS injury. A significant amount of evidence exists to suggest that resident precursor cells proliferate and differentiate into mature glial cells that facilitate tissue repair and recovery. Additionally, the re-entry of mature astrocytes into the cell cycle can also contribute to the pool of new astrocytes that are observed following CNS injury. In order to better understand the glial response to injury in the adult CNS we must revisit the astrocyte-oligodendrocyte relationship. Specifically, we argue that there is a common glial precursor cell from which astrocytes and oligodendrocytes differentiate and that the microenvironment surrounding the injury determines the fate of the stimulated precursor cell. Ideally, better understanding the origin of new glial cells in the injured CNS will facilitate the development of therapeutics targeted to alter the glial response in a beneficial way.","Recent developments in the functional anatomy and physiology of the fish olfactory system reveal three parallel pathways from the sensory epithelium, via the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon. There are three morphological types of sensory neurones spread in a seemingly overlapping arrangement in the olfactory epithelium. The axons of each type of sensory neurones converge to a specific region of the olfactory bulb and connect to separate sets of relay neurones. The axons of these relay neurones leave in three bundles to the telencephalon. Each bundle conveys specific information that elicits sets of characteristic behaviour in response to odours involved in essential life processes in the fish. One pathway is tuned to social cues, another to sex pheromones, and the third to food odours.","Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal disorder whereby genes on chromosome 21 are present in three copies. This gene copy imbalance is thought to be responsible for a number of debilitating conditions experienced by individuals with DS. Amongst these is a reduced cerebellar volume, or cerebellar hypoplasia, which is believed to contribute to the perturbation of fine motor control. Mouse models of DS (such as Ts65Dn, Ts1Cje, Tc1) exhibit a cerebellar phenotype similar to that of individuals with DS and which primarily manifests as a disruption of the density of the granule cell layer. Dissecting which of the three-copy genes are responsible for this phenotype (the primary gene dosage effect) has been a task undertaken by researchers working with various segmental trisomies and transgenic mice. It is generally agreed that, when expressed, three-copy genes of trisomic mice are expressed at around 1.5 times that of the same genes in euploid (wild-type) mice. However, amongst these studies there does not appear to be a consensus on the nature and extent of differential expression of two-copy genes in trisomic mice-the secondary dosage effect. Much of this variation may have to do with the stage of development investigated and the nature and complexity of the tissue (i.e. whole brain versus the cerebellum). The recent discovery that trisomic granule cell precursors are less sensitive to sonic hedgehog-induced proliferation has opened up another avenue for the identification of three-copy genes responsible for the cerebellar phenotype. It is hoped that further investigation of this phenomenon, together with new mouse segmental trisomies and transgenics, will reveal the cause of the proliferation deficit and allow for potential treatment.","The study of the neural correlates of motor behaviour at the systems level has received increasing consideration in recent years. One emerging observation from this research is that neural regions typically associated with cognitive operations may also be recruited during the performance of motor tasks. This apparent convergence between action and cognition - domains that have most often been studied in isolation - becomes especially apparent when examining new complex motor skills such as those involving sequencing or coordination, and when taking into account external (environment-related) factors such as feedback availability and internal (performer-related) factors such as pathology. Neurally, overlap between action and cognition is prominent in frontal lobe areas linked to response selection and monitoring. Complex motor tasks are particularly suited to reveal the crucial link between action and cognition and the generic brain areas at the interface between these domains.","The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein that plays major roles in the regulation of several important cellular functions, especially in the nervous system, where it is involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The secreted extracellular domain of APP, sAPPalpha, acts as a growth factor for many types of cells and promotes neuritogenesis in post-mitotic neurons. Alternative proteolytic processing of APP releases potentially neurotoxic species, including the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide that is centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reinforcing this biochemical link to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, APP is also genetically linked to AD. In this review, we discuss the biological functions of APP in the context of tissue morphogenesis and restructuring, where APP appears to play significant roles both as a contact receptor and as a diffusible factor. Structural investigation of APP, which is necessary for a deeper understanding of its roles at a molecular level, has also been advancing rapidly. We summarize recent progress in the determination of the structure of isolated APP fragments and of the conformations of full-length sAPPalpha, in both monomeric and dimeric states. The potential role of APP dimerization for the regulation of its biological functions is also discussed.","The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans joins the menagerie of behavioral model systems next to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the marine snail Aplysia californica and the mouse. In contrast to Aplysia, which contains 20,000 neurons having cell bodies of hundreds of microns in diameter, C. elegans harbors only 302 tiny neurons from which the cell lineage is completely described, as is the case for all the other somatic cells. As such, this nervous system appears at first sight incommensurable with those of higher organisms, although genome-wide comparison of predicted C. elegans genes with their counterparts in vertebrates revealed many parallels. Together with its short lifespan and ease of cultivation, suitability for high-throughput genetic screenings and genome-wide RNA interference approaches, access to an advanced genetic toolkit and cell-ablation techniques, it seems that this tiny transparent organism of only 1mm in length has nothing to hide. Recently, highly exciting developments have occurred within the field of neuropeptidergic signaling in C. elegans, not only because of the availability of a sequenced genome since 1998, but especially because of state of the art post genomic technologies, that allow for molecular characterization of the signaling molecules. Here, we will focus on endogenous, bioactive (neuro)peptides and mainly discuss biosynthesis, peptide sequence information, localization and G-protein coupled receptors of the three major peptide families in C. elegans.","Toosendanin (TSN) is a triterpenoid extracted from Melia toosendan Sieb et Zucc, which was used as a digestive tract-parasiticide and agricultural insecticide in ancient China. TSN was demonstrated to be a selective presynaptic blocker and an effective antibotulismic agent. By interfering with neurotransmitter release through an initial facilitation followed by a subsequent depression, TSN eventually blocks synaptic transmission at both the neuro-muscular junction and central synapses. Despite sharing some similar actions with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), TSN has a marked antibotulismic effect in vivo and in vitro. Studies suggest that the antibotulismic effect of TSN is achieved by preventing BoNT from approaching its enzymatic substrate, the SNARE protein. It is also found that TSN can induce differentiation and apoptosis in several cell lines, and suppress proliferation of various human cancer cells. TSN inhibits various K(+)-channels, selectively facilitates Ca(2+)-influx via L-type Ca(2+) channels and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). The TSN-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase and overload could be responsible for the TSN-induced biphasic effect on transmitter release, cell differentiation, apoptosis as well as the cytoxicity of TSN.","Neurotrophic factors are essential contributors to the survival of peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) neurons, and demonstration of their reduced availability in diseased brains indicates that they play a role in various neurological disorders. This paper will concentrate on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the survival and activity of the neurons that die in Huntington's disease (HD) by reviewing the evidence indicating that it involves profound changes in BDNF levels and that attempts to restore these levels are therapeutically interesting. BDNF is a small dimeric protein that is widely expressed in adult mammalian brain and has been shown to promote the survival of all major neuronal types affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, cortical BDNF production is required for the correct activity of the corticostriatal synapse and the survival of the GABA-ergic medium-sized spiny striatal neurons that die in HD. We will highlight the available data concerning changes in BDNF levels in HD cells, mice and human postmortem samples, describe the molecular evidence underlying this alteration, and review the data concerning the impact of the experimental manipulation of BDNF levels on HD progression. Such studies have revealed a major loss of BDNF protein in the striatum of HD patients which may contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease. They have also opened up a molecular window into the underlying pathogenic mechanism and new therapeutic perspectives by raising the possibility that one of the mechanisms triggering the reduction in BDNF in HD may also affect the activity of many other neuronal proteins.","The aim of this review is to summarize and critically discuss the complex role played by adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) in Huntington's disease (HD). Since A(2A)Rs are mainly localized on the neurons, which degenerate early in HD, and given their ability to stimulate glutamate outflow and inflammatory gliosis, it was hypothesized that they could be involved in the pathogenesis of HD, and that A(2A)R antagonists could be neuroprotective. This was further sustained by the demonstration that A(2A)Rs and underlying signaling systems undergo profound changes in cellular and animal models of HD. More recently, however, the equation A(2A) receptor blockade=neuroprotection has appeared too simplistic. First, it is now definitely clear that, besides mediating 'bad' responses (for example, stimulation of glutamate outflow and excessive glial activation), A(2A)Rs also promote 'good' responses (such as trophic and antinflammatory effects). This implies that A(2A)R blockade results either in pro-toxic or neuroprotective effects according to the mechanisms involved in a given experimental model. Second, since HD is a chronically progressive disease, the multiple mechanisms involving A(2A)Rs may play different relative roles along the degenerative process. Such different mechanisms can be influenced by A(2A)R activation or blockade in different ways, even leading to opposite outcomes depending on the time of agonist/antagonist administration. The number, and the complexity, of the possible scenarios is further increased by the influence of mutant Huntingtin on both the expression and functions of A(2A)Rs, and by the strikingly different effects mediated by A(2A)Rs expressed by different cell populations within the brain.","Endocannabinoids are endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors, and comprise amides, esters and ethers of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the best-studied members of this class of lipid mediators, and it is now widely accepted that their in vivo concentration and biological activity are largely dependent on a ""metabolic control."" Therefore, the proteins that synthesize, transport and degrade endocannabinoids, and that together with the target receptors form the so-called ""endocannabinoid system,"" are the focus of intense research. This new system will be presented in this review, in order to put in a better perspective the impact of its modulation on Huntington's disease. In particular, the effect of agonists/antagonists of endocannabinoid receptors, or of inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism, will be discussed in the context of onset and progression of Huntington's disease, and will be compared with other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis. Also the plastic changes of endocannabinoids in multiple sclerosis will be reviewed, as a paradigm of their impact in neuroinflammatory disorders.","Many lines of evidence support a role for neuronal damage arising as a result of excessive activation of glutamate receptors by excitatory amino acids in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease. The N-methyl-d-aspartate subclass of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is more selective and effective than the other subclasses in mediating this damage. As well, neurons expressing high levels of NMDARs are lost early from the striatum of individuals affected with Huntington's disease (HD), and injection of NMDAR agonists into the striatum of rodents or non-human primates recapitulates the pattern of neuronal damage observed in HD. Altered NMDAR function has been reported in corticostriatal synapses in one mouse model of HD, and NMDAR-mediated current and/or toxicity have been found to be potentiated in striatal neurons from several HD mouse models as well as heterologous cells expressing the mutant huntingtin protein. Changes in NMDAR activity have been correlated with altered calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase activation. NMDAR stimulation is also closely linked to mitochondrial activity, as treatment with mitochondrial toxins has been demonstrated to produce striatal damage that can be reversed by the addition of NMDAR antagonists. Recent efforts have focused on the elucidation of molecular pathways linking huntingtin to NMDARs, as well as the mechanisms which underlie the enhancement of NMDAR activity by mutant huntingtin. Here, we review the literature to date and recent findings concerning the role of NMDARs in HD pathogenesis.","The corticostriatal pathway provides most of the excitatory glutamatergic input into the striatum and it plays an important role in the development of the phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD). This review summarizes results obtained from genetic HD mouse models concerning various alterations in this pathway. Evidence indicates that dysfunctions of striatal circuits and cortical neurons that make up the corticostriatal pathway occur during the development of the HD phenotype, well before there is significant neuronal cell loss. Morphological changes in the striatum are probably primed initially by alterations in the intrinsic functional properties of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons. Some of these alterations, including increased sensitivity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in subpopulations of neurons, might be constitutively present but ultimately require abnormalities in the corticostriatal inputs for the phenotype to be expressed. Dysfunctions of the corticostriatal pathway are complex and there are multiple changes as demonstrated by significant age-related transient and more chronic interactions with the disease state. There also is growing evidence for changes in cortical microcircuits that interact to induce dysfunctions of the corticostriatal pathway. The conclusions of this review emphasize, first, the general role of neuronal circuits in the expression of the HD phenotype and, second, that both cortical and striatal circuits must be included in attempts to establish a framework for more rational therapeutic strategies in HD. Finally, as changes in cortical and striatal circuitry are complex and in some cases biphasic, therapeutic interventions should be regionally specific and take into account the temporal progression of the phenotype.","Animal models are a promising method to approach the basic mechanisms of the neurobiological disturbances encountered in mental disorders. Depression is characterized by a decrease of REM sleep latency and an increase of rapid eye movement density. In schizophrenia, electrophysiological, tomographic, pharmacological and neurochemical activities are all encountered during REM sleep. Mental retardation and dementia are characterized by rather specific REM sleep disturbances. Identification of the genetic support for these abnormalities (endophenotypes) encountered during REM sleep could help to develop specific treatments.","Development represents a critical moment for shaping adult behavior and may set the stage to disease vulnerability later in life. There is now compelling evidence that stressful experiences during gestation or early in life can lead to enhanced susceptibility for mental illness. In this paper we review the data from experimental studies aimed at investigating behavioral, hormonal, functional and molecular consequences of exposure to stressful events during prenatal or early postnatal life that might contribute to later psychopathology. The use of the newest methodology in the field and the intensive efforts produced by researchers have opened the possibility to reveal the complex, finely tuned and previously unappreciated sets of molecular interactions between different factors that are critical for neurodevelopment thus leading to important discoveries regarding perinatal life. The major focus of our work has been to revise and discuss data from animal studies supporting the role of neuronal plasticity in the long-term effects produced by developmental adversities on brain function as well as the possible implications for disease vulnerability. We believe these studies might prove useful for the identification of novel targets for more effective pharmacological treatments of mental illnesses.","This article reviews neuroimaging studies of conscious and voluntary regulation of various emotional states (sexual arousal, sadness, negative emotion). The results of these studies show that metacognition and cognitive recontextualization selectively alters the way the brain processes and reacts to emotional stimuli. Neuroimaging studies of the effect of psychotherapy in patients suffering from diverse forms of psychopathology (obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, unipolar major depressive disorder, social phobia, spider phobia, borderline personality) are also examined. The results of these studies indicate that the mental functions and processes involved in diverse forms of psychotherapy exert a significant influence on brain activity. Neuroimaging investigations of the placebo effect in healthy individuals (placebo analgesia, psychostimulant expectation) and patients with Parkinson's disease or unipolar major depressive disorder are also reviewed. The results of these investigations demonstrate that beliefs and expectations can markedly modulate neurophysiological and neurochemical activity in brain regions involved in perception, movement, pain, and various aspects of emotion processing. Collectively, the findings of the neuroimaging studies reviewed here strongly support the view that the subjective nature and the intentional content (what they are ""about"" from a first-person perspective) of mental processes (e.g., thoughts, feelings, beliefs, volition) significantly influence the various levels of brain functioning (e.g., molecular, cellular, neural circuit) and brain plasticity. Furthermore, these findings indicate that mentalistic variables have to be seriously taken into account to reach a correct understanding of the neural bases of behavior in humans. An attempt is made to interpret the results of these neuroimaging studies with a new theoretical framework called the Psychoneural Translation Hypothesis.","Serotonin(1A)-receptors (5-HT(1A)-Rs) are important components of the 5-HT system in the brain. As somatodendritic autoreceptors they control the activity of 5-HT neurons, and, as postsynaptic receptors, the activity in terminal areas. Cocaine (COC), amphetamine (AMPH), methamphetamine (METH) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""Ecstasy"", MDMA) are psychostimulant drugs that can lead to addiction-related behavior in humans and in animals. At the neurochemical level, these psychostimulant drugs interact with monoamine transporters and increase extracellular 5-HT, dopamine and noradrenalin activity in the brain. The increase in 5-HT, which, in addition to dopamine, is a core mechanism of action for drug addiction, hyperactivates 5-HT(1A)-Rs. Here, we first review the role of the various 5-HT(1A)-R populations in spontaneous behavior to provide a background to elucidate the contribution of the 5-HT(1A)-Rs to the organization of psychostimulant-induced addiction behavior. The progress achieved in this field shows the fundamental contribution of brain 5-HT(1A)-Rs to virtually all behaviors associated with psychostimulant addiction. Importantly, the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A)-Rs can be dissociated and frequently act in opposite directions. We conclude that 5-HT(1A)-autoreceptors mainly facilitate psychostimulant addiction-related behaviors by a limitation of the 5-HT response in terminal areas. Postsynaptic 5-HT(1A)-Rs, in contrast, predominantly inhibit the expression of various addiction-related behaviors directly. In addition, they may also influence the local 5-HT response by feedback mechanisms. The reviewed findings do not only show a crucial role of 5-HT(1A)-Rs in the control of brain 5-HT activity and spontaneous behavior, but also their complex role in the regulation of the psychostimulant-induced 5-HT response and subsequent addiction-related behaviors.","The brain is unique among organs in many respects, including its mechanisms of lipid synthesis and energy production. The nervous system-specific metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which is synthesized from aspartate and acetyl-coenzyme A in neurons, appears to be a key link in these distinct biochemical features of CNS metabolism. During early postnatal central nervous system (CNS) development, the expression of lipogenic enzymes in oligodendrocytes, including the NAA-degrading enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA), is increased along with increased NAA production in neurons. NAA is transported from neurons to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes, where ASPA cleaves the acetate moiety for use in fatty acid and steroid synthesis. The fatty acids and steroids produced then go on to be used as building blocks for myelin lipid synthesis. Mutations in the gene for ASPA result in the fatal leukodystrophy Canavan disease, for which there is currently no effective treatment. Once postnatal myelination is completed, NAA may continue to be involved in myelin lipid turnover in adults, but it also appears to adopt other roles, including a bioenergetic role in neuronal mitochondria. NAA and ATP metabolism appear to be linked indirectly, whereby acetylation of aspartate may facilitate its removal from neuronal mitochondria, thus favoring conversion of glutamate to alpha ketoglutarate which can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle for energy production. In its role as a mechanism for enhancing mitochondrial energy production from glutamate, NAA is in a key position to act as a magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker for neuronal health, viability and number. Evidence suggests that NAA is a direct precursor for the enzymatic synthesis of the neuron specific dipeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate, the most concentrated neuropeptide in the human brain. Other proposed roles for NAA include neuronal osmoregulation and axon-glial signaling. We propose that NAA may also be involved in brain nitrogen balance. Further research will be required to more fully understand the biochemical functions served by NAA in CNS development and activity, and additional functions are likely to be discovered.","The brain takes a primary position in the organism. We present the novel view that the brain gives priority to controlling its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. It fulfils this tenet by orchestrating metabolism in the organism. The brain activates an energy-on-request system that directly couples cerebral supply with cerebral need. The request system is hierarchically organized among the cerebral hemispheres, the hypothalamus, and peripheral somatomotor, autonomic-visceromotor, and the neuroendocrine-secretomotor neurons. The system initiates allocative behavior (i.e. allocation of energy from body to brain), ingestive behavior (intake of energy from the immediate environment), or exploratory behavior (foraging in the distant environment). Cerebral projections coordinate all three behavioral strategies in such a way that the brain's energy supply is guaranteed continuously. In an ongoing learning process, the brain's request system adapts to various environmental conditions and stressful challenges. Disruption of a cerebral energy-request pathway is critical to the development of obesity: if the brain fails to receive sufficient energy from the peripheral body, it compensates for the undersupply by increasing energy intake from the immediate environment, leaving the body with a surplus. Obesity develops in the long term.","The mitochondrial flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is the main mediator of caspase-independent apoptosis-like programmed cell death. Upon pathological permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, AIF is translocated to the nucleus, where it participates in chromatin condensation and is associated to large-scale DNA fragmentation. Heavy down-regulation of AIF expression in mutant mice or reduced AIF expression achieved with small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides neuroprotection against acute neurodegenerative insults. Paradoxically, in addition to its pro-apoptotic function, AIF likely plays an anti-apoptotic role by regulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via its putative oxidoreductase and peroxide scavenging activities. In this review, we discuss accumulating evidence linking AIF to both acute and chronic neurodegenerative processes by emphasising mechanisms underlying the dual roles apparently played by AIF in these processes.","Parkinson's disease (PD) affects one in every 100 persons above the age of 65 years, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. PD is a disease of the central nervous system that leads to severe difficulties with body motions. The currently available therapies aim to improve the functional capacity of the patient for as long as possible; however they do not modify the progression of the neurodegenerative process. The need for newer and more effective agents is consequently receiving a great deal of attention and consequently being subjected to extensive research. This review concisely compiles the limitations of currently available therapies and the most recent research regarding neuroprotective agents, antioxidants, stem cell research, vaccines and various surgical techniques available and being developed for the management of PD.","Regulation of neuritic growth is crucial for neural development, adaptation and repair. The intrinsic growth potential of nerve cells is determined by the activity of specific molecular sets, which sense environmental signals and sustain structural extension of neurites. The expression and function of these molecules are dynamically regulated by multiple mechanisms, which adjust the actual growth properties of each neuron population at different ontogenetic stages or in specific conditions. The neuronal potential for axon elongation and regeneration are restricted at the end of development by the concurrent action of several factors associated with the final maturation of neurons and of the surrounding tissue. In the adult, neuronal growth properties can be significantly modulated by injury, but they are also continuously tuned in everyday life to sustain physiological plasticity. Strict regulation of structural remodelling and neuritic elongation is thought to be required to maintain specific patterns of connectivity in the highly complex mammalian CNS. Accordingly, procedures that neutralize such mechanisms effectively boost axon growth in both intact and injured nervous system. Even in these conditions, however, aberrant connections are only formed in the presence of unusual external stimuli or experience. Therefore, growth regulatory mechanisms play an essentially permissive role by setting the responsiveness of neural circuits to environmental stimuli. The latter exert an instructive action and determine the actual shape of newly formed connections. In the light of this notion, efficient therapeutic interventions in the injured CNS should combine targeted manipulations of growth control mechanisms with task-specific training and rehabilitation paradigms.","Postural control is integrated in all facets of motor commands. The role of cortico-subcortical pathways underlying postural control, including cerebellum and its afferents (climbing, mossy, and noradrenergic fibers), basal ganglia, motor thalamus, and parieto-frontal neocortex has been identified in animal models, notably through the brain lesion technique in rats and in mice with spontaneous and induced mutations. These studies are complemented by analyses of the factors underlying postural deficiencies in patients with cerebellar atrophy. With the gene deletion technique in mice, specific genes expressed in cerebellum encoding glutamate receptors (Grid2 and Grm1) and other molecules (Prkcc, Cntn6, Klf9, Syt4, and En2) have also been shown to affect postural control. In addition, transgenic mouse models of the synucleinopathies and of Huntington's disease cause deficiencies of motor coordination resembling those of patients with basal ganglia damage.","Adult neurogenesis has been identified in all vertebrate species examined thus far. However, an evolutionary trend towards a reduction in both the number of proliferation zones and the overall number of newborn cells has been revealed in more recent lineages of vertebrates, such as mammals. Adult neurogenesis, and in particular the characterization of adult neural stem cells in mammals has been the focus of intense research with the goal of developing new cell-based regenerative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord injury, and acute damage due to stroke. Conversely, most other vertebrate classes, which display widespread production of adult neurons, are not typically used as model systems in this context. A more profound understanding of the structural composition and the mechanisms that support proliferation zones in the mature brain have become critical for revealing how adult neural stem cells are maintained in these regions and how they regulate neurogenesis. In this review we argue that comprehensive analyses of adult neurogenesis in various vertebrate and invertebrate species will lead to a more complete understanding of the fundamental biology and evolution of adult neurogenesis and provide a better framework for testing hypotheses regarding the functional significance of this trait.","Despite antibiotic therapy and supportive intensive care, the morbidity and mortality of pneumococcal meningitis remain unacceptably high. During the last years, reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), and peroxynitrite, were found to be produced in large amounts during pneumococcal meningitis. Although most likely intended to fight the invasive pathogens, they seem to lead to substantial collateral damage instead. This is because ROS and RNS can exert a vast variety of toxic actions, e.g., through lipid peroxidation, DNA strand breakage followed by PARP activation and subsequent cellular energy depletion, production of inflammatory cytokines, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases. Animal models of pneumococcal meningitis have shown that these interactions contribute to massive meningeal inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, alterations of the cerebral autoregulation, neuronal cell death, and cochlear destruction. Thus, the production of ROS and RNS seems at least in part to be responsible for the poor outcome of patients with pneumococcal meningitis. In consequence, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite have been investigated as potential targets for adjunctive therapy in pneumococcal meningitis. Among the multiple agents tested, one promising drug is N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), which significantly reduced cerebral and cochlear complications in animal models of experimental pneumococcal meningitis.","Mitochondria are the primary generators of ATP and are important regulators of intracellular calcium homeostasis. These organelles are dynamically transported along lengthy neuronal processes, presumably for appropriate distribution to cellular regions of high metabolic demand and elevated intracellular calcium, such as synapses. The removal of damaged mitochondria that produce harmful reactive oxygen species and promote apoptosis is also thought to be mediated by transport of mitochondria to autophagosomes. Mitochondrial trafficking is therefore important for maintaining neuronal and mitochondrial health while cessation of movement may lead to neuronal and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial morphology is also dynamic and is remodeled during neuronal injury and disease. Recent studies reveal different manifestations and mechanisms of impaired mitochondrial movement and altered morphology in injured neurons. These are likely to cause varied courses toward neuronal degeneration and death. The goal of this review is to provide an appreciation of the full range of mitochondrial function, morphology and trafficking, and the critical role these parameters play in neuronal physiology and pathophysiology.","Microglia constitute the primary resident immune surveillance cell in the brain and are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and HIV-associated dementia. Measuring microglial activation in vivo in patients suffering from these diseases may help chart progression of neuroinflammation as well as assess efficacy of therapies designed to modulate neuroinflammation. Recent studies suggest that activated microglia in the CNS may be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing pharmacological ligands of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR (recently renamed as Translocator protein (18kDa)). Beginning with the molecular characterization of PBR and regulation in activated microglia, we examine the rationale behind using PBR ligands to image microglia with PET. Current evidence suggests these findings might be applied to the development of clinical assessments of microglial activation in neurological disorders.","Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has become a standard approach to the investigation of human brain functions. This review starts with a brief review of the human visual system and studies on visual motion detection mechanisms is followed by the presentation of MEG studies that have contributed to the field. Emphasis is placed on the fact that because the neural activities measured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differ substantially from those measured in MEG--fMRI data cannot be used directly to estimate MEG signal sources. The basic ideas behind the methods of signal processing and analyses generally used in MEG studies are described and theoretical considerations of the neural mechanisms determining MEG response latency and amplitude changes are discussed. Here, scalar fields theory is proposed to explain MEG responses to incoherent motions, and the ways in which detection of complex motions such as transparency, rotation and expansion can be explained by this theory are also presented. Relationships between human behavioral reaction time and MEG response latency suggest a new concept underlying the reasons why humans are late in detecting slow motion.","At early stages of differentiation neurons already contain many of the components necessary for synaptic transmission. However, in order to establish fully functional synapses, both the pre- and postsynaptic partners must undergo a process of maturation. At the presynaptic level, synaptic vesicles (SVs) must acquire the highly specialized complement of proteins, which make them competent for efficient neurotransmitter release. Although several of these proteins have been characterized and linked to precise functions in the regulation of the SV life cycle, a systematic and unifying view of the mechanisms underlying selective protein sorting during SV biogenesis remains elusive. Since SV components do not share common sorting motifs, their targeting to SVs likely relies on a complex network of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, as well as on post-translational modifications. Pleiomorphic carriers containing SV proteins travel and recycle along the axon in developing neurons. Nevertheless, SV components appear to eventually undertake separate trafficking routes including recycling through the neuronal endomembrane system and the plasmalemma. Importantly, SV biogenesis does not appear to be limited to a precise stage during neuronal differentiation, but it rather continues throughout the entire neuronal lifespan and within synapses. At nerve terminals, remodeling of the SV membrane results from the use of alternative exocytotic pathways and possible passage through as yet poorly characterized vacuolar/endosomal compartments. As a result of both processes, SVs with heterogeneous molecular make-up, and hence displaying variable competence for exocytosis, may be generated and coexist within the same nerve terminal.","Brain cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and involved in a number of biological functions such as membrane trafficking, signal transduction, myelin formation and synaptogenesis. Given these widespread activities and the knowledge that all brain cholesterol derives from local synthesis, it is not surprising that dysfunctions in cholesterol synthesis, storage, transport and removal may lead to human brain diseases. Some of these diseases emerge as a consequence of genetic defects in the enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis; in other cases, such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a link between cholesterol metabolism and the formation and deposition of amyloid-beta peptide. Emerging evidence indicates that changes in cholesterol synthesis may also occur in Huntington's disease, an inherited, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons of the brain. We here provide an overview of the involvement of cholesterol in normal brain function and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we consider the available clinical, biological and molecular evidence indicating a potential dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in Huntington's disease.","The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown. In addition, this terrible neurodegenerative disease will increase exponentially over the next two decades due to longer lifespan and an aging ""baby-boomer"" generation. All treatments currently approved for AD have moderate efficacy in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients, and no efficacy in halting progression of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need for new drug targets and delivery methods to slow or reverse the progression of AD. One molecule that has received much attention in its potential therapeutic role in AD is nerve growth factor (NGF). This review will demonstrate data from humans and animals which promote NGF as a potential therapeutic target by (1) outlining the hypothesis behind using NGF for the treatment of AD, (2) reviewing both the normal and AD altered signaling pathways and effects of NGF in the central nervous system (CNS), and (3) examining the results of NGF treatment obtained from animal models of AD and AD patients.","Memorizing new facts and events means that entering information produces specific physical changes within the brain. According to the commonly accepted view, traces of memory are stored through the structural modifications of synaptic connections, which result in changes of synaptic efficiency and, therefore, in formations of new patterns of neural activity (the hypothesis of synaptic plasticity). Most of the current knowledge on learning and initial stages of memory consolidation (""synaptic consolidation"") is based on this hypothesis. However, the hypothesis of synaptic plasticity faces a number of conceptual and experimental difficulties when it deals with potentially permanent consolidation of declarative memory (""system consolidation""). These difficulties are rooted in the major intrinsic self-contradiction of the hypothesis: stable declarative memory is unlikely to be based on such a non-stable foundation as synaptic plasticity. Memory that can last throughout an entire lifespan should be ""etched in stone."" The only ""stone-like"" molecules within living cells are DNA molecules. Therefore, I advocate an alternative, genomic hypothesis of memory, which suggests that acquired information is persistently stored within individual neurons through modifications of DNA, and that these modifications serve as the carriers of elementary memory traces.","The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are important regulators of physiological and pathological processes in the central and peripheral nervous system. In general, JNKs are considered as mediators of neuronal degeneration in response to stress and injury. However, recent data have provided substantial evidence that JNKs are also essential for physiological and regenerative signalling in neurons. This review summarizes the importance of JNKs for neurite formation and outgrowth, brain development, dendritic architecture and regeneration of nerve fibers after injury. We discuss putative mechanisms which control the bipartite actions of individual JNK isoforms for neuronal death and repair after nerve fiber injury with a particular focus on the role of the transcription factor c-Jun.","Norepinephrine is involved in intrinsic control of pain. Main sources of norepinephrine are sympathetic nerves peripherally and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei A1-A7 centrally. Peripheral norepinephrine has little influence on pain in healthy tissues, whereas in injured tissues it has variable effects, including aggravation of pain. Its peripheral pronociceptive effect has been associated with injury-induced expression of novel noradrenergic receptors, sprouting of sympathetic nerve fibers, and pronociceptive changes in the ionic channel properties of primary afferent nociceptors, while an interaction with the immune system may contribute in part to peripheral antinociception induced by norepinephrine. In the spinal cord, norepinephrine released from descending pathways suppresses pain by inhibitory action on alpha-2A-adrenoceptors on central terminals of primary afferent nociceptors (presynaptic inhibition), by direct alpha-2-adrenergic action on pain-relay neurons (postsynaptic inhibition), and by alpha-1-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of inhibitory interneurons. Additionally, alpha-2C-adrenoceptors on axon terminals of excitatory interneurons of the spinal dorsal horn possibly contribute to spinal control of pain. At supraspinal levels, the pain modulatory effect by norepinephrine and noradrenergic receptors has varied depending on many factors such as the supraspinal site, the type of the adrenoceptor, the duration of the pain and pathophysiological condition. While in baseline conditions the noradrenergic system may have little effect, sustained pain induces noradrenergic feedback inhibition of pain. Noradrenergic systems may also contribute to top-down control of pain, such as induced by a change in the behavioral state. Following injury or inflammation, the central as well as peripheral noradrenergic system is subject to various plastic changes that influence its antinociceptive efficacy.","Polysialic acid (PSA) is a linear homopolymer of alpha2-8-N acetylneuraminic acid whose major carrier in vertebrates is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). PSA serves as a potent negative regulator of cell interactions via its unusual biophysical properties. PSA on NCAM is developmentally regulated thus playing a prominent role in different forms of neural plasticity spanning from embryonic to adult nervous system, including axonal growth, outgrowth and fasciculation, cell migration, synaptic plasticity, activity-induced plasticity, neuronal-glial plasticity, embryonic and adult neurogenesis. The cellular distribution, developmental changes and possible function(s) of PSA-NCAM in the central nervous system of mammals here are reviewed, along with recent findings and theories about the relationships between NCAM protein and PSA as well as the role of different polysialyltransferases. Particular attention is focused on postnatal/adult neurogenesis, an issue which has been deeply investigated in the last decade as an example of persisting structural plasticity with potential implications for brain repair strategies. Adult neurogenic sites, although harbouring all subsequent steps of cell differentiation, from stem cell division to cell replacement, do not faithfully recapitulate development. After birth, they undergo morphological and molecular modifications allowing structural plasticity to adapt to the non-permissive environment of the mature nervous tissue, that are paralled by changes in the expression of PSA-NCAM. The use of PSA-NCAM as a marker for exploring differences in structural plasticity and neurogenesis among mammalian species is also discussed.","G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes are large gene families in every animal, sometimes making up to 1-2% of the animal's genome. Of all insect GPCRs, the neurohormone (neuropeptide, protein hormone, biogenic amine) GPCRs are especially important, because they, together with their ligands, occupy a high hierarchic position in the physiology of insects and steer crucial processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. In this paper, we give a review of our current knowledge on Drosophila melanogaster GPCRs and use this information to annotate the neurohormone GPCR genes present in the recently sequenced genome from the honey bee Apis mellifera. We found 35 neuropeptide receptor genes in the honey bee (44 in Drosophila) and two genes, coding for leucine-rich repeats-containing protein hormone GPCRs (4 in Drosophila). In addition, the honey bee has 19 biogenic amine receptor genes (21 in Drosophila). The larger numbers of neurohormone receptors in Drosophila are probably due to gene duplications that occurred during recent evolution of the fly. Our analyses also yielded the likely ligands for 40 of the 56 honey bee neurohormone GPCRs identified in this study. In addition, we made some interesting observations on neurohormone GPCR evolution and the evolution and co-evolution of their ligands. For neuropeptide and protein hormone GPCRs, there appears to be a general co-evolution between receptors and their ligands. This is in contrast to biogenic amine GPCRs, where evolutionarily unrelated GPCRs often bind to the same biogenic amine, suggesting frequent ligand exchanges (""ligand hops"") during GPCR evolution.","Mastery of a language is a capacity that distinguishes humans from other animals. Attempts to identify the brain functions that are necessary for the possession of linguistic skills began in the 19th century with the research of Broca and Wernicke. We trace the principal experimental developments since then, ranging from psychological studies of aphasic patients to non-invasive brain-imaging investigations. The development of theories concerning word recognition, reading aloud, fluent speech and understanding utterances are described. Possible brain regions involved in these abilities, identified by means of non-invasive imaging, are considered. We examine the various claims made by these researchers as to what their experiments show and in particular examine the validity of their theories. This conceptual analysis shows that in many cases the interpretation of experiments is confused and that the theories elaborated are not tenable. We seek to clarify what can be substantiated concerning the workings of the brain and the exercise of linguistic skills.","The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the critical mediator of the vertebrate stress response system, responding to environmental stressors by maintaining internal homeostasis and coupling the needs of the body to the wants of the mind. The HPA axis has numerous complex drivers and highly flexible operating characterisitics. Major drivers include two circadian drivers, two extra-hypothalamic networks controlling top-down (psychogenic) and bottom-up (systemic) threats, and two intra-hypothalamic networks coordinating behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine outflows. These various networks jointly and flexibly control HPA axis output of periodic (oscillatory) functions and a range of adventitious systemic or psychological threats, including predictable daily cycles of energy flow, actual metabolic deficits over many time scales, predicted metabolic deficits, and the state-dependent management of post-prandial responses to feeding. Evidence is provided that reparation of metabolic derangement by either food or glucocorticoids results in a metabolic signal that inhibits HPA activity. In short, the HPA axis is intimately involved in managing and remodeling peripheral energy fluxes, which appear to provide an unidentified metabolic inhibitory feedback signal to the HPA axis via glucocorticoids. In a complementary and perhaps a less appreciated role, adrenocortical hormones also act on brain to provide not only feedback, but feedforward control over the HPA axis itself and its various drivers, as well as coordinating behavioral and autonomic outflows, and mounting central incentive and memorial networks that are adaptive in both appetitive and aversive motivational modes. By centrally remodeling the phenotype, the HPA axis provides ballistic and predictive control over motor outflows relevant to the type of stressor. Evidence is examined concerning the global hypothesis that the HPA axis comprehensively induces integrative phenotypic plasticity, thus remodeling the body and its governor, the brain, to yoke the needs of the body to the wants of the mind. Adverse side effects of this yoking under conditions of glucocorticoid excess are discussed.","The trace amines are a structurally related group of amines and their isomers synthesized in mammalian brain and peripheral nervous tissues. They are closely associated metabolically with the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmitter systems in mammalian brain. Like dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin the trace amines have been implicated in a vast array of human disorders of affect and cognition. The trace amines are unique as they are present in trace concentrations, exhibit high rates of metabolism and are distributed heterogeneously in mammalian brain. While some are synthesized in their parent amine neurotransmitter systems, there is also evidence to suggest other trace amines may comprise their own independent neurotransmitter systems. A substantial body of evidence suggests that the trace amines may play very significant roles in the coordination of biogenic amine-based synaptic physiology. At high concentrations, they have well-characterized presynaptic ""amphetamine-like"" effects on catecholamine and indolamine release, reuptake and biosynthesis; at lower concentrations, they possess postsynaptic modulatory effects that potentiate the activity of other neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and serotonin. The trace amines also possess electrophysiological effects that are in opposition to these neurotransmitters, indicating to some researchers the existence of receptors specific for the trace amines. While binding sites or receptors for a few of the trace amines have been advanced, the absence of cloned receptor protein has impeded significant development of their detailed mechanistic roles in the coordination of catecholamine and indolamine synaptic physiology. The recent discovery and characterization of a family of mammalian G protein-coupled receptors responsive to trace amines such as beta-phenylethylamine, tyramine, and octopamine, including socially ingested psychotropic drugs such as amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide, have revitalized the field of scientific studies investigating trace amine synaptic physiology, and its association with major human disorders of affect and cognition.","Few things can be considered to be more important to a cell than its threshold for apoptotic cell death, which can be modulated up or down, but rarely in both directions, by a single enzyme. Therefore, it came as quite a surprise to find that one enzyme, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), has the perplexing capacity to either increase or decrease the apoptotic threshold. These apparently paradoxical effects now are known to be due to GSK3 oppositely regulating the two major apoptotic signaling pathways. GSK3 promotes cell death caused by the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but inhibits the death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Intrinsic apoptotic signaling, activated by cell damage, is promoted by GSK3 by facilitation of signals that cause disruption of mitochondria and by regulation of transcription factors that control the expression of anti- or pro-apoptotic proteins. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway entails extracellular ligands stimulating cell-surface death receptors that initiate apoptosis by activating caspase-8, and this early step in extrinsic apoptotic signaling is inhibited by GSK3. Thus, GSK3 modulates key steps in each of the two major pathways of apoptosis, but in opposite directions. Consequently, inhibitors of GSK3 provide protection from intrinsic apoptosis signaling but potentiate extrinsic apoptosis signaling. Studies of this eccentric ability of GSK3 to oppositely influence two types of apoptotic signaling have shed light on important regulatory mechanisms in apoptosis and provide the foundation for designing the rational use of GSK3 inhibitors for therapeutic interventions.","Although the dualistic concept is unpopular among neuroscientists involved in experimental studies of the brain, neurophysiological literature is full of covert dualistic statements on the possibility of understanding neural mechanisms of human consciousness. Particularly, the covert dualistic attitude is exhibited in the unwillingness to discuss neural mechanisms of consciousness, leaving the problem of consciousness to psychologists and philosophers. This covert dualism seems to be rooted in the main paradigm of neuroscience that suggests that cognitive functions, such as language production and comprehension, face recognition, declarative memory, emotions, etc., are performed by neural networks consisting of simple elements. I argue that neural networks of any complexity consisting of neurons whose function is limited to the generation of electrical potentials and the transmission of signals to other neurons are hardly capable of producing human mental activity, including consciousness. Based on results obtained in physiological, morphological, clinical, and genetic studies of cognitive functions (mainly linguistic ones), I advocate the hypothesis that the performance of cognitive functions is based on complex cooperative activity of ""complex"" neurons that are carriers of ""elementary cognition."" The uniqueness of human cognitive functions, which has a genetic basis, is determined by the specificity of genes expressed by these ""complex"" neurons. The main goal of the review is to show that the identification of the genes implicated in cognitive functions and the understanding of a functional role of their products is a possible way to overcome covert dualism in neuroscience.","Insulin is best known for its role in peripheral glucose homeostasis. Less studied, but not less important, is its role in the central nervous system. Insulin and its receptor are located in the central nervous system and are both implicated in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, over the past few years it has become evident that the effects of insulin, on neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, are mediated by a common signal transduction cascade, which has been identified as ""the PI3K route"". This route has turned out to be a major integrator of insulin signaling in the brain. A pronounced feature of this insulin-activated route is that it promotes survival by directly inactivating the pro-apoptotic machinery. Interestingly, it is this same route that is required for the induction of long-term potentiation and depression, basic processes underlying learning and memory. This leads to the hypothesis that the PI3K route forms a direct link between learning and memory and neuronal survival. The implications of this hypothesis are far reaching, since it provides an explanation why insulin has beneficial effects on learning and memory and how synaptic activity can prevent cellular degeneration. Applying this knowledge may provide novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.","Mitochondria are critical for cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production; however, recent studies suggest that these organelles fulfill a much broader range of tasks. For example, they are involved in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, intracellular pH and apoptosis, and are the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Various reactive molecules that originate from mitochondria, such as ROS, are critical in pathological events, such as ischemia, as well as in physiological events such as long-term potentiation, neuronal-vascular coupling and neuronal-glial interactions. Due to their key roles in the regulation of several cellular functions, the dysfunction of mitochondria may be critical in various brain disorders. There has been increasing interest in the development of tools that modulate mitochondrial function, and the refinement of techniques that allow for real time monitoring of mitochondria, particularly within their intact cellular environment. Innovative imaging techniques are especially powerful since they allow for mitochondrial visualization at high resolution, tracking of mitochondrial structures and optical real time monitoring of parameters of mitochondrial function. The techniques discussed include classic imaging techniques, such as rhodamine-123, the highly advanced semi-conductor nanoparticles (quantum dots), and wide field microscopy as well as high-resolution multiphoton imaging. We have highlighted the use of these techniques to study mitochondrial function in brain tissue and have included studies from our laboratories in which these techniques have been successfully applied.","The proteolytical processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to beta-amyloid peptides, which accumulate in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Different soluble or insoluble higher molecular weight forms of beta-amyloid peptides have been postulated to trigger a complex pathological cascade that may cause synaptic dysfunction, inflammatory processes, neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and finally the onset of the disease. The generation of beta-amyloid peptides requires the proteolytical cleavage of APP by an aspartyl protease named beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The expression and enzymatic activity of BACE1 are increased in brains of AD patients. Here we discuss the importance of a number of recently identified transcription factors as well as post-transcriptional modifications and activation of intracellular signaling molecules for the regulation of BACE1 expression in brain. Importantly, some of these factors are known to be involved in the inflammatory and chronic stress responses of the brain, which are compromised during aging. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that beneficial effects of non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs on the progression of AD are mediated--at least in part--by effects on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma response element present in the BACE1 promoter. The identification of the cell type-specific expression and activation of NF-kappaB, Sp1 and YY1 transcription factors may provide a basis to specifically interfere with BACE1 expression and, thereby, to lower the concentrations of beta-amyloid peptides, which may prevent neuronal cell loss and cognitive decline in AD patients.","The midbrain roof is a retinorecipient region referred to as the optic tectum in lower vertebrates, and the superior colliculus in mammals. The retinal fibers projecting to the tectum transmit visual information to tectal retinorecipient neurons. Periventricular neurons are a subtype of these neurons that have their somata in the deepest layer of the teleostean tectum and apical dendrites ramifying at more superficial layers consisting of retinal fibers. The retinotectal synapses between the retinal fibers and periventricular neurons are glutamatergic, and ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate the transmission in these synapses. This transmission involves long-term potentiation, and is modulated by hormone action. Visual information processed in the periventricular neurons is transmitted to adjacent tectal cells and target nuclei of periventricular neuron axonal branches, some of which relay the visual information to other brain areas controlling behavior. We demonstrated that periventricular neurons play a principal role in visual information processing in the teleostean optic tectum; the effects of tectal output on behavior is discussed also in the present review.","Until recently, memory consolidation and storage had been traditionally viewed as a permissive process derived from learning-activated molecular signaling cascades which include activations of the NMDA receptors, CaMKII, PKC, PKA and other kinases, new protein synthesis and CREB-mediated gene expression, and subsequent structural modifications at certain synapses. However, the time-scale of such a cascade is incompatible with the timescale of systems-level memory consolidation. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that synaptic proteins and structures are not stationary, but rather are highly dynamical and subjected to metabolic turnovers which would cause drift in synaptic efficacy and subsequently unstable neural circuits. Recent experiments using inducible gene- or protein-knockout techniques reveal that post-learning NMDA receptor and CaMKII reactivations are required for the systems-level consolidation of both hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent memories. Furthermore, the reactivations of the NMDA receptors are also necessary for the long-term storage of old memories in the neural circuits. Therefore, the NMDA receptor reactivation-mediated synaptic reentry reinforcement (SRR) process may represent the unifying cellular mechanism in linking the consolidation and storage of long-term memories from the molecular level to the systems-level.","A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) transmembrane proteins have metalloprotease, integrin-binding, intracellular signaling and cell adhesion activities. In contrast to other metalloproteases, ADAMs are particularly important for cleavage-dependent activation of proteins such as Notch, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), and can bind integrins. Not surprisingly, ADAMs have been shown or suggested to play important roles in the development of the nervous system, where they regulate proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival of various cells, as well as axonal growth and myelination. On the eleventh anniversary of the naming of this family of proteins, the relatively unknown ADAMs are emerging as potential therapeutic targets for neural repair. For example, over-expression of ADAM10, one of the alpha-secretases for APP, can prevent amyloid formation and hippocampal defects in an Alzheimer mouse model. Another example of this potential neural repair role is the finding that ADAM21 is uniquely associated with neurogenesis and growing axons of the adult brain. This comprehensive review will discuss the growing literature about the roles of ADAMs in the developing and adult nervous system, and their potential roles in neurological disorders. Most excitingly, the expanding understanding of their normal roles suggests that they can be manipulated to promote neural repair in the degenerating and injured adult nervous system.","Which aspects of language and cognitive processing take place irrespective of whether subjects focus their attention on incoming stimuli and are, in this sense, automatic? The Mismatch Negativity (MMN), a neurophysiological brain response recorded in the EEG and MEG, is elicited by attended and unattended stimuli alike. Recent studies investigating the cognitive processes underlying spoken language processing found that even under attentional withdrawal, MMN size and topography reflect the activation of memory traces for language elements in the human brain. Familiar sounds of one's native language elicit a larger MMN than unfamiliar sounds, and at the level of meaningful language units, words elicit a larger MMN than meaningless pseudowords. This suggests that the MMN reflects the activation of memory networks for language sounds and spoken words. Unattended word stimuli elicit an activation sequence starting in superior-temporal cortex and rapidly progressing to left-inferior-frontal lobe. The spatio-temporal patterns of cortical activation depend on lexical and semantic properties of word stems and affixes, thus indicating that the MMN can give clues about lexico-semantic information processing stored in long term memory. At the syntactic level, MMN size was found to reflect whether a word string conforms to abstract grammatical rules. This growing body of results suggests that lexical, semantic and syntactic information can be processed by the central nervous system outside the focus of attention in a largely automatic manner. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of generator activations underlying the MMN to speech may be an important tool for investigating the brain dynamics of spoken language processing and the activated distributed cortical circuits acting at long-term memory traces.","The main aim of the paper is to present an up-to-date computational theory of hippocampal function and the predictions it makes about the different subregions (dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1), and to examine behavioral and electrophysiological data that address the functions of the hippocampus and particularly its subregions. Based on the computational proposal that the dentate gyrus produces sparse representations by competitive learning and via the mossy fiber pathway forces new representations on the CA3 during learning (encoding), it has been shown behaviorally that the dentate gyrus supports spatial pattern separation during learning. Based on the computational proposal that CA3-CA3 autoassociative networks are important for episodic memory, it has been shown behaviorally that the CA3 supports spatial rapid one-trial learning, learning of arbitrary associations where space is a component, pattern completion, spatial short-term memory, and sequence learning by associations formed between successive items. The concept that the CA1 recodes information from CA3 and sets up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, is consistent with findings on consolidation. Behaviorally, the CA1 is implicated in processing temporal information as shown by investigations requiring temporal order pattern separation and associations across time; computationally this could involve temporal decay memory, and temporal sequence memory which might also require CA3. The perforant path input to DG is implicated in learning, to CA3 in retrieval from CA3, and to CA1 in retrieval after longer time intervals (""intermediate-term memory"").","Complex computations in the nervous system begin with electrical signals generated in single neurons. Such signals include action potentials mediated by the opening of voltage-dependent ion channels, and synaptic potentials arising from neurotransmitter receptor activation. The amplitude, waveform, and propagation of action potentials and synaptic potentials influence cellular signaling in profound ways, and are largely determined by activities of ion channels in the cell membrane. The location and properties of ion channels therefore play critical roles in shaping electrical signaling in the neuron, which is the foundation for more complex computations at network levels. This review summarizes what we know about the great diversity of K(+) channels found in neuronal dendrites, the subcellular compartment where synaptic signals integrate and where various forms of plasticity occur. Specifically, we discuss the molecular identity, the distribution, kinase modulation, biophysical properties, and functional roles of a variety of K(+) channels including voltage-gated, calcium-activated, and ligand-gated/G-protein coupled K(+) channels. One emerging theme from recent literature is the recognition that K(+) channels are powerful regulators of the function of dendrites. A second theme indicates that this K(+) channel regulation depends on their unique subcellular distribution. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of non-uniform distributions of ion channels are beginning to be understood in greater detail. An especially intriguing aspect of above mechanisms is that they are achieved through protein kinase phosphorylation and may thus be activity-dependent. In parts of this review, we choose to focus on CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rodent hippocampus and the K(+) channels in their dendrites. Being one of the best-characterized cell types in the nervous system, the CA1 pyramidal neuron has long been studied as a prototypic neuron from which general rules of neuronal computation and synaptic plasticity emerge. A great deal of what we know about dendritic K(+) channels comes from studies on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Where available, we also include up-to-date findings on dendritic K(+) channels in other cell types.","The transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) consists of a variety of dimers composed of members of the Jun and Fos families of proteins. However, it is the up-regulation of c-jun that is a particularly common event in the developing, adult as well as in injured nervous system that serves as a model of transcriptional control of brain function. In view of the long list of excellent in depth overviews on the different members of the Jun family and associated molecules, the primary focus of the current paper is to focus on c-Jun specifically and discuss the evidence on the involvement of this transcription factor in ischaemia and stroke, in seizures, during learning and memory, or following axonal injury and during successful regeneration. Functional studies employing in vivo strategies using gene deletion, targeted expression of dominant negative isoforms and pharmacological inhibitors all suggest a bipotential role of c-Jun, in mediating neurodegeneration and cell death, as well as in plasticity and repair. Phosphorylation of c-Jun, and the activation of its upstream kinases (Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) 1-3, JNK kinases (JNKK)) is required in many but not in all forms of these events, with only a partial overlap of the Jun-, JNK- or JNKK(n)-dependent functions. Moreover, a better understanding of the non-overlapping roles could considerably increase the potential of pharmacological agents to improve neurological outcome following trauma, neonatal encephalopathy and stroke, or neurodegenerative disease.","P2X(7) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, expressed as homo-oligomeric assemblies of individual subunits. They are widely distributed at immunocompetent cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and are believed to be primarily involved in host-defense reaction. However, a growing amount of evidence indicates that their signaling role in the brain is more widespread than previously anticipated. In this paper, we review the present knowledge on the structural and pharmacological features of the P2X(7) receptor, as well as its cell-type specific localization in the nervous system. Subsequently, the participation of P2X(7) receptors in distinct neuronal, astroglial and microglial functions are described. Finally, since they may play a prominent role in certain neurologic disorders, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury and sensory neuropathies, the pathological role and potential therapeutic exploitation of P2X(7) receptors are also discussed.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share several pathological mechanisms. The parallels between amyloid beta (Abeta) in AD and alpha-synuclein in PD have been discussed in several reports. However, studies of the last few years show that Abeta also shares several important characteristics with neuromelanin (NM), whose role in PD is emerging. First, both molecules accumulate with aging, the greatest risk factor for AD and PD. Second, in spite of their different structures, Abeta and NM have similar characteristics that could also lead to neuroprotection. Metals are required to catalyze their formation and they can bind large amounts of these metals, generating stable complexes and thus playing a protective role against metal toxicity. Moreover, they may be able to remove toxic species such as oligopeptides and excess cytosolic dopamine. Third, both Abeta and NM have been implicated in parallel aspects of the neuronal death that underlies AD and PD, respectively. For example, both molecules can activate microglia, inducing release of toxic factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO). A careful analysis of these parallel effects of Abeta and NM, including their seemingly paradoxical ability to participate in both cell death and protection, may lead to an improved understanding of the roles of these molecules in neurodegeneration and also provide insights into possible parallels in the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and PD.","Metazoans possess complicated multicellular structure among the multicellularities of eukaryotes. One evolutionary pressure that permits such complexity relates to the directed and precise informational transmission performed by numerous synapses in neuron system. Neurotransmitter inactivations play essential roles in the termination of synaptic transmission and are thus crucial for precise synaptic transmission. Here, we performed a genomic comparison among 11 eukaryotic organisms including five bilaterian species and six pan-unicellular eukaryotes to search for genes related to metazoan multicellular function. The result showed that the majority of genes related to neurotransmitter inactivation in the synaptic cleft endured high and stable selective pressure and were specifically present in bilaterians, whereas genes related to transmitter release and postsynaptic transmitter receptors did not show these properties. From these data we conclude that neurotransmitter inaction may play a critical role in the origin of the nerve system encountered in the early evolution of metazoan. In addition, we suggest that neurotransmitter inactivation probably participates in the formation or refinement of the synapse, following the concept of ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."" Further experimental evidence is needed to support the suggestion and to explain the importance of neurotransmitter inactivation to metazoan multicellular function.","Detailed pathophysiological findings of secondary damage phenomena after spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as the identification of inhibitory and neurotrophic proteins have yielded a plethora of experimental therapeutic approaches. Main targets are (i) to minimize secondary damage progression (neuroprotection), (ii) to foster axon conduction (neurorestoration) and (iii) to supply a permissive environment to promote axonal sprouting (neuroregenerative therapies). Pre-clinical studies have raised hope in functional recovery through the antagonism of growth inhibitors, application of growth factors, cell transplantation, and vaccination strategies. To date, even though based on successful pre-clinical animal studies, results of clinical trials are characterized by dampened effects attributable to difficulties in the study design (patient heterogeneity) and species differences. A combination of complementary therapeutic strategies might be considered pre-requisite for future synergistic approaches. Here, we line out pre-clinical interventions resulting in improved functional neurological outcome after spinal cord injury and track them on their intended way to bedside.","The receptor for activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) is an intracellular adaptor protein. Accumulating evidence attributes to this member of the tryptophan-aspartate (WD) repeat family the role of regulating several major nervous system pathways. Structurally, RACK1 is a seven-bladed-beta-propeller, interacting with diverse proteins having distinct structural folds. When bound to the IP3 receptor, RACK1 regulates intracellular Ca2+ levels, potentially contributing to processes such as learning, memory and synaptic plasticity. By binding to the NMDA receptor, it dictates neuronal excitation and sensitivity to ethanol. When bound to the stress-induced acetylcholinesterase variant AChE-R, RACK1 is implicated in stress responses and behavior, compatible with reports of RACK1 modulations in brain ageing and in various neurodegenerative diseases. This review sheds new light on both the virtues and the variety of neuronal RACK1 interactions and their physiological consequences.","Research over the last few years has demonstrated that the amygdaloid complex in amniotes shares basic developmental, hodological and neurochemical features. Furthermore, homolog territories of all main amygdaloid subdivisions have been recognized among amniotes, primarily highlighted by the common expression patterns for numerous developmental genes. With the achievement of new technical approaches, the study of the precise neuroanatomy of the telencephalon of the anuran amphibians has been possible, revealing that most of the structures present in amniotes are recognizable in these anamniotes. Thus, recent investigations have yielded enough results to support the notion that the organization of the anuran amygdaloid complex includes subdivisions with origin in ventral pallial and subpallial territories, a strong relationship with the vomeronasal and olfactory systems, abundant intra-amygdaloid connections, a main output center involved in the autonomic system, profuse amygdaloid fiber systems, and distinct chemoarchitecture. When all these new data about the development, connectivity and neurochemistry of the amygdaloid complex in anurans are taken into account, it becomes patent that a basic organization pattern is shared by both amniotic and anamniotic tetrapods.","Shortly after John Eccles completed his studies of synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine, he opened another chapter of neuroscience with his work on the cerebellum. From 1963 to 1967, Eccles and his colleagues in Canberra successfully dissected the complex neuronal circuitry in the cerebellar cortex. In the 1967 monograph, ""The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine"", he, in collaboration with Masao Ito and Janos Szentágothai, presented blue-print-like wiring diagrams of the cerebellar neuronal circuitry. These stimulated worldwide discussions and experimentation on the potential operational mechanisms of the circuitry and spurred theoreticians to develop relevant network models of the machinelike function of the cerebellum. In following decades, the neuronal machine concept of the cerebellum was strengthened by additional knowledge of the modular organization of its structure and memory mechanism, the latter in the form of synaptic plasticity, in particular, long-term depression. Moreover, several types of motor control were established as model systems representing learning mechanisms of the cerebellum. More recently, both the quantitative preciseness of cerebellar analyses and overall knowledge about the cerebellum have advanced considerably at the cellular and molecular levels of analysis. Cerebellar circuitry now includes Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells as additional unique elements. Other new revelations include the operation of the complex glomerulus structure, intricate signal transduction for synaptic plasticity, silent synapses, irregularity of spike discharges, temporal fidelity of synaptic activation, rhythm generators, a Golgi cell clock circuit, and sensory or motor representation by mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Furthermore, it has become evident that the cerebellum has cognitive functions, and probably also emotion, as well as better-known motor and autonomic functions. Further cerebellar research is required for full understanding of the cerebellum as a broad learning machine for neural control of these functions.","Since the early 20th century, it has been recognized that motoneurons must fire repetitive trains of action potentials to produce muscle contraction. In 1932, Sir John Eccles, together with Hebbel Hoff, found that action potential spike trains in motor axons were produced by ""rhythmic centres"", which were within the motoneurons themselves. Two decades later, Eccles attended a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium in NY, USA entitled ""The Neuron"". Two of the many notable presentations at this symposium were juxtaposed: one by Eccles from the University of Otago, Dunedin, NZL, and the other by J. Walter Woodbury and Harry Patton from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. Both presentations included data obtained using sharp microelectrodes to study the intracellularly recorded potentials of cat motoneurons. In this review, I discuss some of the events leading up to and surrounding this jointly accomplished advance and proceed to discussion of subsequent studies over 5+ decades that have made use of intracellular recordings from motoneurons to study their repetitive firing behavior. This begins with early descriptions of primary and secondary range firing, and continues to the discovery of dendritic persistent inward currents and their relation to plateau potentials, synaptic amplification, and motoneuronal firing. Following a brief description of the possible mechanisms underlying spike frequency adaptation, I discuss the modulation of repetitive firing properties during various motor behaviors. It has become increasingly clear that the central nervous system has exquisite control of the repetitive firing of motoneurons. Eccles' work laid the foundation for the present-day study of these processes.","This review focuses on investigations by Sir John Eccles and co-workers in Canberra, AUS in the 1950s, in which they used intracellular recordings to unravel the organization of neuronal networks in the cat spinal cord. Five classical spinal reflexes are emphasized: recurrent inhibition of motoneurons via motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells, pathways from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, presynaptic inhibition, and the flexor reflex. To set the scene for these major achievements I first provide a brief account of the understanding of the spinal cord in ""reflex"" and ""voluntary"" motor activities from the beginning of the 20th century. Next, subsequent work is reviewed on the convergence on spinal interneurons from segmental sensory afferents and descending motor pathways, much of which was performed and inspired by Anders Lundberg's group in Gothenburg, SWE. This work was the keystone for new hypotheses on the role of spinal circuits in normal motor control. Such hypotheses were later tested under more natural conditions; either by recording directly from interneurons in reduced animal preparations or by use of indirect non-invasive techniques in humans performing normal movements. Some of this latter work is also reviewed. These developments would not have been possible without the preceding work on spinal reflexes by Eccles and Lundberg. Finally, there is discussion of how Eccles' work on spinal reflexes remains central (1) as new techniques are introduced on direct recording from interneurons in behaving animals; (2) in experiments on plastic neuronal changes in relation to motor learning and neurorehabilitation; (3) in experiments on transgenic animals uncovering aspects of human pathophysiology; and (4) in evaluating the function of genetically identified classes of neurons in studies on the development of the spinal cord.","After scientific successes in the study of synaptic activation and inhibition of motoneurons and unraveling mechanisms underlying presynaptic inhibition, Sir John Eccles was interested in studying synaptic mechanisms governing the activity of neurons in the brain stem, cerebellum, and various cortical areas. In this new arena, his group discovered several principles, which have later been shown to generalize across brain structures and have substantial functional significance. Among these were the first identification and location of inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex and recurrent inhibitory systems in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and thalamus.","Problems associated with the topic of the mind-brain interaction are reviewed and analyzed. If there is an interaction, then the ""mind"" and ""brain"" are independent variables; the mind represents subjective experience and is therefore a non-physical phenomenon. This fact led to the need for a field theory, termed here the ""cerebral mental field"" (CMF). By definition, the CMF is a system property produced by the appropriate activities of billions of neurons. An experimental test of this theory is possible and a test design is presented. The most direct experimental evidence has been obtained by use of intracranial stimulating and recording electrodes. Important information has also been developed, however, with extracranial imaging techniques. These can be very fast (in ms), but the cerebral neuronal events that produce changes in physiological properties require a time delay for their processing. A number of surprising time factors affecting the appearance of a subjective somatosensory experience are described, and their wider implications are discussed. Among these is a delay (up to 0.5 s) in the generation of a sensory awareness. Thus, unconscious cerebral processes precede a subjective sensory experience. If this can be generalized to all kinds of subjective experiences, it would mean that all mental events begin unconsciously and not just those that never become conscious. In spite of the delay for a sensory experience, subjectively there appears to be no delay. Evidence was developed to demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on an antedating of the delayed experience. There is a subjective referral backward in time to coincide with the time of the primary cortical response to the earliest arriving sensory signal. The subjective referral in time is analogous to the well-known subjective referral in space. In conclusion, features of the CMF can be correlated with brain events, even though the CMF is non-physical, by study of subjective reports from the human subject.","Presynaptic inhibition is one of many areas of neurophysiology in which Sir John Eccles did pioneering work. Frank and Fuortes first described presynaptic inhibition in 1957. Subsequently, Eccles and his colleagues characterized the process more fully and showed its relationship to primary afferent depolarization. Eccles' studies emphasized presynaptic inhibition of the group Ia monosynaptic reflex pathway but also included group Ib, II and cutaneous afferent pathways, and the dorsal column nuclei. Presynaptic inhibition of the group Ia afferent pathway was demonstrated by depression of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibition of monosynaptic reflex discharges. Primary afferent depolarization was investigated by recordings of dorsal root potentials, dorsal root reflexes, cord dorsum and spinal cord field potentials, and tests of the excitability of primary afferent terminals. Primary afferent depolarization was proposed to result in presynaptic inhibition by reducing the amplitude of the action potential as it invades presynaptic terminals. This resulted in less calcium influx and, therefore, less transmitter release. Presynaptic inhibition and primary afferent depolarization could be blocked by antagonists of GABA(A) receptors, implying a role of interneurons that release gamma aminobutyric acid in the inhibitory circuit. The reason why afferent terminals were depolarized was later explained by a high intracellular concentration of Cl(-) ions in primary sensory neurons. Activation of GABA(A) receptors opens Cl(-) channels, and Cl(-) efflux results in depolarization. Another proposed mechanism of depolarization was an increase in extracellular concentration of K(+) following neural activity. Eccles' work on presynaptic inhibition has since been extended in a variety of ways.","This chapter deals with the central role that Sir John Eccles played in the elucidation of the mechanisms of synaptic transmission within the central nervous system during the three decades between the late 1930s and 1966. His seminal discoveries involved studies of synaptic input to spinal motoneurons using intracellular recording via glass micropipettes after their introduction in the late 1940s. After defending the hypothesis that electrical currents alone explained central synaptic events, his observations of reversal potentials and sensitivity to ion injections instantly converted Eccles to the idea that central synapses generate postsynaptic potentials, designated IPSPs and EPSPs, by liberating chemical transmitters. He and his collaborators used pharmacological manipulations of recurrent inhibition to support the idea that a given neuron liberates the same chemical transmitter substance at all of its synapses, which he called ""Dale's Principle"". His team worked out the mechanisms and spinal circuits underlying disynaptic and recurrent inhibition, as well as those of presynaptic inhibition. Not content with the view that central synapses were static entities, Eccles also made seminal observations on synaptic plasticity induced by alterations in use and disuse. Although his firmly held belief that the extensive dendritic trees of motoneurons were essentially irrelevant to synaptic events at the soma was later refuted by others in the mid-1960s, Eccles stands as a towering figure in the history of neuroscience. His prodigious energy and commanding intellect gave the field of central synaptic transmission the conceptual bases that have guided it for over 40 years.","Sir John Eccles' experimental life evolved from the ""bottom"" up: the synapse to the modular circuitry of the spinal cord, later the cerebellum and, less extensively, also the thalamus and hippocampus. He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' ""Swiss period"" (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called ""supplementary"" motor area was rather a ""supramotor"" area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, János Szentágothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.","Recognition that the entire central nervous system (CNS) is highly plastic, and that it changes continually throughout life, is a relatively new development. Until very recently, neuroscience has been dominated by the belief that the nervous system is hardwired and changes at only a few selected sites and by only a few mechanisms. Thus, it is particularly remarkable that Sir John Eccles, almost from the start of his long career nearly 80 years ago, focused repeatedly and productively on plasticity of many different kinds and in many different locations. He began with muscles, exploring their developmental plasticity and the functional effects of the level of motor unit activity and of cross-reinnervation. He moved into the spinal cord to study the effects of axotomy on motoneuron properties and the immediate and persistent functional effects of repetitive afferent stimulation. In work that combined these two areas, Eccles explored the influences of motoneurons and their muscle fibers on one another. He studied extensively simple spinal reflexes, especially stretch reflexes, exploring plasticity in these reflex pathways during development and in response to experimental manipulations of activity and innervation. In subsequent decades, Eccles focused on plasticity at central synapses in hippocampus, cerebellum, and neocortex. His endeavors extended from the plasticity associated with CNS lesions to the mechanisms responsible for the most complex and as yet mysterious products of neuronal plasticity, the substrates underlying learning and memory. At multiple levels, Eccles' work anticipated and helped shape present-day hypotheses and experiments. He provided novel observations that introduced new problems, and he produced insights that continue to be the foundation of ongoing basic and clinical research. This article reviews Eccles' experimental and theoretical contributions and their relationships to current endeavors and concepts. It emphasizes aspects of his contributions that are less well known at present and yet are directly relevant to contemporary issues.","This report reviews the academic lineage of Sir John Eccles; who trained him, whom he then trained and with whom he collaborated, and the subsequent impact of his trainees and collaborators on neuroscience and other areas. In a post-training career at five institutions in four countries (Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, back to Australia, USA) and during retirement in Switzerland, Eccles trained and collaborated with over 180 people (mostly neuroscientists) from 21 countries. Most of them have had stellar research and training records that span the cellular-behavioral-philosophical spectrum of neuroscience, with a focus from peripheral neuromuscular issues to the forebrain. Some have been equally distinguished in other areas of biomedical science. Eccles' academic contributions and lineage are a valuable colloquium topic in a neuroscience training program. His experimental work spanned much of the 20th C before the recent emphasis on the application of the techniques of molecular biology. He continually sought to integrate information from the cellular to the systems and behavioral levels of analysis and synthesis. He also devoted a substantial amount of his intellectual effort to the mind-brain and other philosophical issues. Eccles' prodigious working hours and enthusiasm for his projects were a role model for such trainees. Hard-working trainees often ask how can they retain their all-round interests, and indeed their humanity and citizenry, as they focus more and more on their necessarily narrowly focused neuroscience research. Again, Eccles' writings and overall behavior show that it can indeed be done, but only by the application of extraordinary effort and dedication.","The induction of long-term depression (LTD) can be divided into two main forms, one dependent upon activation of postsynaptic NMDAR, and another independent of postsynaptic NMDAR. Non-postsynaptic NMDAR-LTD (non-NMDAR-LTD) occurs in many regions of the brain, and encompasses a wide variety of induction and expression mechanisms. In this article, the induction and expression mechanisms of such LTD in over 10 brain regions are described, with a number of common mechanisms compared across a large range of types of LTD. The article describes the involvement of different presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors in the induction of non-NMDAR-LTD, especially metabotropic glutamate receptors, cannabinoid receptors and dopamine receptors. An increase in presynaptic or postsynaptic intracellular Ca concentration is a key event in induction, commonly followed by activation of certain kinases, especially PKC, p38 MAPK and ERK. Expression mechanisms are either presynaptic via a reduction in release probability, or postsynaptic involving a decrease in AMPAR via phosphorylation of a glutamate receptor subunit, especially GluR2, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Retrograde signalling from postsynaptic to presynaptic occurs when induction is postsynaptic and expression is presynaptic.","Specific vulnerability of substantia nigra compacta neurons as compared to ventral tegmental area neurons, as emphasized in Parkinson's disease, has been studied for many years and is still not well understood. The molecular codes and mechanisms that drive development of these structures have recently been studied through the use of elegant genetic ablation experiments. The data suggested that specific genes at specific anatomical positions in the ventricular zone are crucial to drive development of young neurons into the direction of the dopaminergic phenotype. In addition, it has become clear the these dopaminergic neurons are present in the diencephalon and in the mesencephalon and that they may contain a specific molecular signature that defines specific subsets in terms of position and function. The data indicate that these specific subsets may explain the specific response of these neurons to toxins and genetic ablation.","A theory is presented that specifies the amount of light that is needed for the perception of any stimulus that is defined in space, time and color. For detection and discrimination mechanistic neural elements with deterministic procedures exist. Twin pairs of red and green cones are ordered in three sets along clockwise and counter clockwise revolving spirals and along circles around the center of the fovea. In the rod-free fovea the red pairs are ordered along the spirals and the green along the circles. Each cone is accompanied by--dependent on retinal eccentricity--up to 100 satellite rods. For the retinal signal processing such a receptor group constitutes a space-quantum in analogy with time-quanta of about 0.04 s. In the peripheral retina the red and green twin pairs of space-quanta are roughly ordered along and at random distributed over the spirals and circles. Over each time-quantum, the cone and rods of a space-quantum sum their responses in a common nerve circuit of the luminosity channel. The summation's results from twin pairs of the same set of space-quanta are correlated by two-fold spatio-temporal coincidence mechanisms in the retina. Their outcome signals the perception of light, movement and edge. In the fused binocular visual field the movement and edge signals of the three sets from both eyes perfectly join vectorially together, provided the responding pairs of space-quanta are binocularly in perfect register as they normally are. The receptor's Weber gain control makes the receptor an all-or-none-system. The space-quantum's De Vries gain control makes its sensitivity equal to the average of the poisson fluctuations in quantum absorption per time-quantum. The controls are based on, respectively, arithmetically feed forward and backward inhibitive nerve mechanisms. The thermal noise of the photo-pigment resets the controls. The response to the second quantum absorption in a time-quantum in the individual rod, red or green cone has accession to the white, red or green nerve color circuit, respectively, and produces there a corresponding color signal. Already a single absorption in a blue cone is for a blue signal. In the retina, for the generation of yellow signals, the color circuits of individual red and green cones of each mixed entwined triple of red and green twin pairs of space-quanta are cross-connected through a nerve opponent color circuit. In the lateral geniculate nucleus in groups of seven neighboring triples, through two nerve opponent color circuits that are common for the two eyes together, the red and green signals as well as the yellow and blue mutually annihilate each other's color. White signals remain. In anomalous trichromacy, the space-quanta of some pairs have different cones or in one of them the cone is missing. In dichromacy, all pairs have different cones or one type of cones is missing. For perceptive resolution the periodic scanning of the retinal image by the eye tremor in synchrony with the time-quanta, overrules the limit of optical resolution as set by diffraction in the eye optics. Dependent on pupil diameter the scanning contributes up to a factor of about 30 to resolution. The action potentials of the Purkinje cells in the myocardium generate the time-quanta of the central nervous system as well as the mechanical scanning of the retinal image through the synchronic periodic variation of the tonus in the eye muscles.","The flexion or flexor reflex (FR) recorded in the lower limbs in humans (LLFR) is a widely investigated neurophysiological tool. It is a polysynaptic and multisegmental spinal response that produces a withdrawal of the stimulated limb and resembles (having several features in common) the hind-paw FR in animals. The FR, in both animals and humans, is mediated by a complex circuitry modulated at spinal and supraspinal level. At rest, the LLFR (usually obtained by stimulating the sural/tibial nerve and by recording from the biceps femoris/tibial anterior muscle) appears as a double burst composed of an early, inconstantly present component, called the RII reflex, and a late, larger and stable component, called the RIII reflex. Numerous studies have shown that the afferents mediating the RII reflex are conveyed by large-diameter, low-threshold, non-nociceptive A-beta fibers, and those mediating the RIII reflex by small-diameter, high-threshold nociceptive A-delta fibers. However, several afferents, including nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers from skin and muscles, have been found to contribute to LLFR activation. Since the threshold of the RIII reflex has been shown to correspond to the pain threshold and the size of the reflex to be related to the level of pain perception, it has been suggested that the RIII reflex might constitute a useful tool to investigate pain processing at spinal and supraspinal level, pharmacological modulation and pathological pain conditions. As stated in EFNS guidelines, the RIII reflex is the most widely used of all the nociceptive reflexes, and appears to be the most reliable in the assessment of treatment efficacy. However, the RIII reflex use in the clinical evaluation of neuropathic pain is still limited. In addition to its nocifensive function, the LLFR seems to be linked to posture and locomotion. This may be explained by the fact that its neuronal circuitry, made up of a complex pool of interneurons, is interposed in motor control and, during movements, receives both peripheral afferents (flexion reflex afferents, FRAs) and descending commands, forming a multisensorial feedback mechanism and projecting the output to motoneurons. LLFR excitability, mediated by this complex circuitry, is finely modulated in a state- and phase-dependent manner, rather as we observe in the FR in animal models. Several studies have demonstrated that LLFR excitability may be influenced by numerous physiological conditions (menstrual cycle, stress, attention, sleep and so on) and pathological states (spinal lesions, spasticity, Wallenberg's syndrome, fibromyalgia, headaches and so on). Finally, the LLFR is modulated by several drugs and neurotransmitters. In summary, study of the LLFR in humans has proved to be an interesting functional window onto the spinal and supraspinal mechanisms of pain processing and onto the spinal neural control mechanisms operating during posture and locomotion.","As much as brain stem death is currently the clinical definition of death in many countries and is a phenomenon of paramount medical importance, there is a dearth of information on its mechanistic underpinnings. A majority of the clinical studies are concerned only with methods to determine brain stem death. Whereas a vast amount of information is available on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell death, rarely are these studies directed specifically towards the understanding of brain stem death. This review presents a framework for translational research on brain stem death that is based on systematically coordinated clinical and laboratory efforts that center on this phenomenon. It begins with the identification of a novel clinical marker from patients that is related specifically to brain stem death. After realizing that this ""life-and-death"" signal is related to the functional integrity of the brain stem, its origin is traced to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Subsequent laboratory studies on this neural substrate in animal models of brain stem death provide credence to the notion that both ""pro-life"" and ""pro-death"" programs are at work during the progression towards death. Those programs (mitochondrial functions, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, superoxide anion, coenzyme Q10, heat shock proteins and ubiquitin-proteasome system) hitherto identified from the RVLM are presented, along with their cellular and molecular mechanisms. It is proposed that outcome of the interplay between the ""pro-life"" and ""pro-death"" programs (dying) in this neural substrate determines the final fate of the individual (being dead). Thus, identification of additional programs in the RVLM and delineation of their regulatory mechanisms should shed new lights on future directions for clinical management of life-and-death.","The protooncogene c-fos is rapidly activated after noxious stimuli to express the protein Fos in spinal dorsal horn neurons that are in the 'correct' locations for nociceptive information transfer. As such, therefore, mapping Fos expression in these neurons is at present the best global marker for efficiently locating populations of neurons in the awake animal that respond to nociceptive input. This allows, among other things, precise behavioral measurements to be correlated with Fos expression. Two arenas where mapping dorsal horn Fos expression has made a major impact are in the anatomy of nociceptive systems and as a useful assay for the analgesic properties of various therapeutic regimens. Also Fos expression is the only way to map populations of neurons that are responding to non-localized input such as withdrawal after addiction and vascular occlusion. Another insight is that it shows a clear activation of neurons in superficial 'pain-processing' laminae by innocuous stimuli after nerve lesions, a finding that presumably bears on the allodynia that often accompanies these lesions. It is to be understood, however, that the Fos localizations are not sufficient unto themselves, but the major function of these studies is to efficiently locate populations of cells in nociceptive pathways so that powerful anatomic and physiologic techniques can be brought to bear efficiently. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the studies whose numbers are geometrically expanding that deal with Fos in the dorsal horn and the conclusions therefrom.","Schizophrenia is widely regarded to be a neurocognitive disorder, i.e. a dysfunction of the neural and cognitive systems subserving thinking and reasoning, memory, language, attention and perception. However, although cognitive dysfunction is certainly a cardinal feature of schizophrenia, we argue that dysfunction of emotional brain systems may be even more important in understanding the disorder. Indeed, in recent years research on the emotional aspects of schizophrenia is accumulating at a high rate. Here, we review the available evidence regarding behavioral and neural manifestations of abnormal emotional systems in schizophrenia. This evidence comes from patient studies using tasks of emotion recognition, emotional expression and emotional experience. Furthermore, studies of schizophrenia patients using structural MRI have demonstrated volume reductions of the amygdala, a key structure of the emotional brain. Finally, functional fMRI studies have revealed an attenuated response of the amygdala to emotional stimuli as compared to neutral stimuli. Beyond demonstrating that dysfunction of the emotional brain is a hallmark of schizophrenia, we propose a model that integrates previous neural accounts of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia, and specifies a neural basis for differential emotional correlates of positive and negative symptoms. Specifically, a lesion to the amygdala in combination with reduced interconnectivity with the prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to give rise to reduced emotional expression (affective flattening) and emotion recognition deficits. In contrast, an imbalance in dopamine systems may underlie increased anxiety and autonomic arousal, and the assignment of emotional salience to insignificant stimuli, associated with psychosis. We also hypothesize that the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala may contribute differentially to these abnormalities.","The brain circuitry of saccadic eye movements, from brainstem to cortex, has been extensively studied during the last 30 years. The wealth of data gathered allowed the conception of numerous computational models. These models proposed descriptions of the putative mechanisms generating this data, and, in turn, made predictions and helped to plan new experiments. In this article, we review the computational models of the five main brain regions involved in saccade generation: reticular formation saccadic burst generators, superior colliculus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and premotor cortical areas. We present the various topics these models are concerned with: location of the feedback loop, multimodal saccades, long-term adaptation, on the fly trajectory correction, strategy and metrics selection, short-term spatial memory, transformations between retinocentric and craniocentric reference frames, sequence learning, to name the principle ones. Our objective is to provide a global view of the whole system. Indeed, narrowing too much the modelled areas while trying to explain too much data is a recurrent problem that should be avoided. Moreover, beyond the multiple research topics remaining to be solved locally, questions regarding the operation of the whole structure can now be addressed by building on the existing models.","Excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals onto postsynaptic channels gated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA (AMPA and KA) receptors. Extracellular signals control diverse neuronal functions and are responsible for mediating activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength and neuronal survival. Influx of extracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](e)) through the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is required for neuronal activity to change the strength of many synapses. At the molecular level, the NMDAR interacts with signaling modules, which, like the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, transduce excitatory signals across neurons. Recent burgeoning evidence points to the fact that MAPKs play a crucial role in regulating the neurochemistry of NMDARs, their physiologic and biochemical/biophysical properties, and their potential role in pathophysiology. It is the purpose of this review to discuss: (i) the MAPKs and their role in a plethora of cellular functions; (ii) the role of MAPKs in regulating the biochemistry and physiology of NMDA receptors; (iii) the kinetics of MAPK-NMDA interactions and their biologic and neurochemical properties; (iv) how cellular signaling pathways, related cofactors and intracellular conditions affect NMDA-MAPK interactions and (v) the role of NMDA-MAPK pathways in pathophysiology and the evolution of disease conditions. Given the versatility of the NMDA-MAPK interactions, the NMDA-MAPK axis will likely form a neurochemical target for therapeutic interventions.","Animal models have provided invaluable data for identifying the pathogenesis of epileptic disorders. Clearly, the relevance of these experimental findings would be strengthened by the demonstration that similar fundamental mechanisms are at work in the human epileptic brain. Epilepsy surgery has indeed opened the possibility to directly study the functional properties of human brain tissue in vitro, and to analyze the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis. Here, we summarize the findings obtained over the last 40 years from electrophysiological, histochemical and molecular experiments made with the human brain tissue. In particular, this review will focus on (i) the synaptic and non-synaptic properties of neocortical neurons along with their ability to produce synchronous activity; (ii) the anatomical and functional alterations that characterize limbic structures in patients presenting with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; (iii) the issue of antiepileptic drug action and resistance; and (iv) the pathophysiology of seizure genesis in Taylor's type focal cortical dysplasia. Finally, we will address some of the problems that are inherent to this type of experimental approach, in particular the lack of proper controls and possible strategies to obviate this limitation.","The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is one of the commonest neurological sensorimotor disorders at least in the Western countries and is often associated with periodic limb movements (PLM) during sleep leading to severe insomnia. However, it remains largely underdiagnosed and its underlying pathogenesis is presently unknown. Women are more affected than men and early-onset disease is associated with familial cases. A genetic origin has been suggested but the mode of inheritance is unknown. Secondary causes of RLS may share a common underlying pathophysiology implicating iron deficiency or misuse. The excellent response to dopaminegic drugs points to a central role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of RLS. Iron may also represent a primary factor in the development of RLS, as suggested by recent pathological and brain imaging studies. However, the way dopamine and iron, and probably other compounds, interact to generate the circadian pattern in the occurrence of RLS and PLM symptoms remains unknown. The same is also the case for the level of interaction of the two compounds within the central nervous system (CNS). Recent electrophysiological and animals studies suggest that complex spinal mechanisms are involved in the generation of RLS and PLM symptomatology. Dopamine modulation of spinal reflexes through dopamine D3 receptors was recently highlighted in animal models. The present review suggests that RLS is a complex disorder that may result from a complex dysfunction of interacting neuronal networks at one or several levels of the CNS and involving numerous neurotransmitter systems.","The functional effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor, pro-NGF, are thought to be mediated through binding of these ligands to one or both of their receptors, TrkA and p75NTR. While the signaling pathways and downstream effects of NGF binding to TrkA are reasonably well known, those related to the binding of NGF and pro-NGF to p75NTR are less well understood. Furthermore, p75NTR appears to play functional roles that are unrelated to its ability to bind NGF and pro-NGF, some of which are ligand-independent and others of which are dependent upon binding to other neurotrophins. As these functional roles and their biochemical mechanisms become better known, the importance of p75NTR, related receptors, and both extracellular ligands and intracellular interactors and effectors for human development and health has become increasingly apparent. A complete understanding of p75NTR and its cellular partners is best served by approaching the remaining questions from both sides, with studies of function in normal states and studies of dysfunction in aberrant states mutually informing one another.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2006 Aug;79(5-6):341-2.,"Central vestibular neurons play an important role in the processing of body motion-related multisensory signals and their transformation into motor commands for gaze and posture control. Over recent years, medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons and to a lesser extent other vestibular neurons have been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro, in a range of species. These studies have begun to reveal how their intrinsic electrophysiological properties may relate to their response patterns, discharge dynamics and computational capabilities. In vitro studies indicate that MVN neurons are of two major subtypes (A and B), which differ in their spike shape and after-hyperpolarizations. This reflects differences in particular K(+) conductances present in the two subtypes, which also affect their response dynamics with type A cells having relatively low-frequency dynamics (resembling ""tonic"" MVN cells in vivo) and type B cells having relatively high-frequency dynamics (resembling ""kinetic"" cells in vivo). The presence of more than one functional subtype of vestibular neuron seems to be a ubiquitous feature since vestibular neurons in the chick and frog also subdivide into populations with different, analogous electrophysiological properties. The ratio of type A to type B neurons appears to be plastic, and may be determined by the signal processing requirements of the vestibular system, which are species-variant. The membrane properties and discharge pattern of type A and type B MVN neurons develop largely post-natally, through the expression of the underlying ion channel conductances. The membrane properties of MVN neurons show rapid and long-lasting plastic changes after deafferentation (unilateral labyrinthectomy), which may serve to maintain their level of activity and excitability after the loss of afferent inputs.","The medicinal leech has served as an important experimental preparation for neuroscience research since the late 19th century. Initial anatomical and developmental studies dating back more than 100 years ago were followed by behavioral and electrophysiological investigations in the first half of the 20th century. More recently, intense studies of the neuronal mechanisms underlying leech movements have resulted in detailed descriptions of six behaviors described in this review; namely, heartbeat, local bending, shortening, swimming, crawling, and feeding. Neuroethological studies in leeches are particularly tractable because the CNS is distributed and metameric, with only 400 identifiable, mostly paired neurons in segmental ganglia. An interesting, yet limited, set of discrete movements allows students of leech behavior not only to describe the underlying neuronal circuits, but also interactions among circuits and behaviors. This review provides descriptions of six behaviors including their origins within neuronal circuits, their modification by feedback loops and neuromodulators, and interactions between circuits underlying with these behaviors.","Once it was believed that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was no more than a relay station serving as a ""gate"" for ascending basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. Nowadays, the STN is considered to be one of the main regulators of motor function related to the basal ganglia. The role of the STN in the regulation of associative and limbic functions related to the basal ganglia has generally received little attention. In the present review, the functional role of the STN in the control of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical associative and limbic circuits is discussed. In the past 20 years the concepts about the functional role of the STN have changed dramatically: from being an inhibitory nucleus to a potent excitatory nucleus, and from being involved in hyperkinesias to hypokinesias. However, it has been demonstrated only recently, mainly by reports on the behavioral (side-) effects of STN deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is a popular surgical technique in the treatment of patients suffering from advanced Parkinson Disease (PD), that the STN is clinically involved in associative and limbic functions. These findings were confirmed by results from animal studies. Experimental studies applying STN DBS or STN lesions to investigate the neuronal mechanisms involved in these procedures found profound effects on cognitive and motivational parameters. The anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral data presented in this review point towards a potent regulatory function of the STN in the processing of associative and limbic information towards cortical and subcortical regions. In conclusion, it can be stated that the STN has anatomically a central position within the basal ganglia thalamocortical associative and limbic circuits and is functionally a potent regulator of these pathways.","A characteristic feature of sensory circuits is the existence of orderly connections that represent maps of sensory space. A major research focus in developmental neurobiology is to elucidate the relative contributions of neural activity and guidance molecules in sensory map formation. Two model systems for addressing map formation are the retinotopic map formed by retinal projections to the superior colliculus (SC) (or its non-mammalian homolog, the optic tectum (OT)), and the eye-specific map formed by retinal projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. In mammals, a substantial portion of retinotopic and eye-specific refinement of retinal axons occurs before vision is possible, but at a time when there is a robust, patterned spontaneous retinal activity called retinal waves. Though complete blockade of retinal activity disrupts normal map refinement, attempts at more refined perturbations, such as pharmacological and genetic manipulations that alter features of retinal waves critical for map refinement, remain controversial. Here we review: (1) the mechanisms that underlie the generation of retinal waves; (2) recent experiments that have investigated a role for guidance molecules and retinal activity in map refinement; and (3) experiments that have implicated various signaling cascades, both in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their post-synaptic targets, in map refinement. It is likely that an understanding of retinal activity, guidance molecules, downstream signaling cascades, and the interactions between these biological systems will be critical to elucidating the mechanisms of sensory map formation.","Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent processing of information that emerges from the links between attentional perceptual processes, working memory and reward-based evaluation of the performed actions. We describe a computational neuroscience theoretical framework which shows how an attentional state held in a short term memory in the prefrontal cortex can by top-down processing influence ventral and dorsal stream cortical areas using biased competition to account for many aspects of visual attention. We also show how within the prefrontal cortex an attentional bias can influence the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs, and thus play an important role in decision making. We also show how the absence of expected rewards can switch an attentional bias signal, and thus rapidly and flexibly alter cognitive performance. This theoretical framework incorporates spiking and synaptic dynamics which enable single neuron responses, fMRI activations, psychophysical results, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the effects of damage to parts of the system to be explicitly simulated and predicted. This computational neuroscience framework provides an approach for integrating different levels of investigation of brain function, and for understanding the relations between them. The models also directly address how bottom-up and top-down processes interact in visual cognition, and show how some apparently serial processes reflect the operation of interacting parallel distributed systems.","The developmental stages involved in the conversion of stem cells to fully functional neurons of specific neurotransmitter phenotype are complex and not fully understood. Over the past decade many studies have been published that demonstrate that in vitro manipulation of the epigenetic environment of the stem cells allows experimental control of final neuronal phenotypic choice. This review presents the evidence for the involvement of a number of endogenous neurobiochemicals, which have been reported to potently influence DAergic (and other neurotransmitter) phenotype expression in vitro. They act at different stages on the pathway to neurotransmitter phenotype determination, and in different ways. Many are better known for their involvement in other aspects of development, and in other biochemical roles. Their proper place, and precise roles, in neurotransmitter phenotype determination in vivo will no doubt be determined in the future. Meanwhile, considerable medical benefits are offered from producing large, long-term, viable cryostores of self-regenerating multipotential neural precursor cells (i.e., brain stem cells), which can be used for cell replacement therapies in the treatment of degenerative brain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) act as molecular coincidence detectors and allow for association or dissociation between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. NMDA receptors are central to remodeling of synaptic connections during postnatal development and associative learning abilities in adults. The ability to remodel neural networks is altered during postnatal development, possibly due to a change in the composition of NMDARs. That is, as forebrain systems (and cerebellum) develop, synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs (NR2B-NMDARs) are replaced by NR2A-containing NMDARs (NR2A-NMDARs) and NR2B-NMDARs move to extrasynaptic sites. During the initial phase of the switch, synapses contain both NR2A- and NR2B-NMDARs and both long-term potentiation and long-term depression are enhanced. As NMDAR subunit expression decreases and NR2A-NMDARs come to predominate in the synapse, channel function and synaptic plasticity are reduced, and remodeling ability dissipates. The end result is a balance of plasticity and stability that is optimal for information processing and storage. Associative learning abilities involving different sensory modalities emerge sequentially, in accordance with synaptic maturation in related cortical and underlying brain structures. Thus, developmental alterations in NMDAR composition that occur at different ages in various brain structures may explain the protracted nature of the maturation of various associative learning abilities.","The transcriptomic and proteomic techniques presented in part I (Functional Genomics meets neurodegenerative disorders. Part I: transcriptomic and proteomic technology) of this back-to-back review have been applied to a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), Prion diseases (PrD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Samples have been derived either from human brain and cerebrospinal fluid, tissue culture cells or brains and spinal cord of experimental animal models. With the availability of huge data sets it will firstly be a major challenge to extract meaningful information and secondly, not to obtain contradicting results when data are collected in parallel from the same source of biological specimen using different techniques. Reliability of the data highly depends on proper normalization and validation both of which are discussed together with an outlook on developments that can be anticipated in the future and are expected to fuel the field. The new insight undoubtedly will lead to a redefinition and subdivision of disease entities based on biochemical criteria rather than the clinical presentation. This will have important implications for treatment strategies.","Transcriptomics and proteomics are increasingly applied to gain a mechanistic insight into neurodegenerative disorders. These techniques not only identify distinct, differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins but are also employed to dissect signaling pathways and reveal networks by using an integrated approach. In part I of this back-to-back review, technical aspects are discussed: in the transcriptomics section, which includes enrichment by laser microcapture dissection, we comment on qRT-PCR, SAGE, subtractive hybridization, differential display and microarrays, including software packages. In the proteomics section we discuss two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography, methods to label and enrich specific proteins or peptides, and different types of mass spectrometers. These tools have been applied to a range of neurodegenerative disorders and are discussed and integrated in part II (Functional Genomics meets neurodegenerative disorders. Part II: application and data integration).","Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule with pleiotropic effects in different tissues. NO is synthesized by NO synthases (NOS), a family with four major types: endothelial, neuronal, inducible and mitochondrial. They can be found in almost all the tissues and they can even co-exist in the same tissue. NO is a well-known vasorelaxant agent, but it works as a neurotransmitter when produced by neurons and is also involved in defense functions when it is produced by immune and glial cells. NO is thermodynamically unstable and tends to react with other molecules, resulting in the oxidation, nitrosylation or nitration of proteins, with the concomitant effects on many cellular mechanisms. NO intracellular signaling involves the activation of guanylate cyclase but it also interacts with MAPKs, apoptosis-related proteins, and mitochondrial respiratory chain or anti-proliferative molecules. It also plays a role in post-translational modification of proteins and protein degradation by the proteasome. However, under pathophysiological conditions NO has damaging effects. In disorders involving oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Parkinson's disease, NO increases cell damage through the formation of highly reactive peroxynitrite. The paradox of beneficial and damaging effects of NO will be discussed in this review.","Interest in BDNF as an activity-dependent modulator of neuronal structure and function in the adult brain has intensified in recent years. Localization of BDNF-TrkB to glutamate synapses makes this system attractive as a dynamic, activity-dependent regulator of excitatory transmission and plasticity. Despite individual breakthroughs, an integrated understanding of BDNF function in synaptic plasticity is lacking. Here, we attempt to distill current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and function of BDNF in LTP. BDNF activates distinct mechanisms to regulate the induction, early maintenance, and late maintenance phases of LTP. Evidence from genetic and pharmacological approaches is reviewed and tabulated. The specific contribution of BDNF depends on the stimulus pattern used to induce LTP, which impacts the duration and perhaps the subcellular site of BDNF release. Particular attention is given to the role of BDNF as a trigger for protein synthesis-dependent late phase LTP--a process referred to as synaptic consolidation. Recent experiments suggest that BDNF activates synaptic consolidation through transcription and rapid dendritic trafficking of mRNA encoded by the immediate early gene, Arc. A model is proposed in which BDNF signaling at glutamate synapses drives the translation of newly transported (Arc) and locally stored (i.e., alphaCaMKII) mRNA in dendrites. In this model BDNF tags synapses for mRNA capture, while Arc translation defines a critical window for synaptic consolidation. The biochemical mechanisms by which BDNF regulates local translation are also discussed. Elucidation of these mechanisms should shed light on a range of adaptive brain responses including memory and mood resilience.","Inflammation, a common denominator among the diverse list of neurodegenerative diseases, has recently been implicated as a critical mechanism responsible for the progressive nature of neurodegeneration. Microglia are the resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system and produce a barrage of factors (IL-1, TNFalpha, NO, PGE2, superoxide) that are toxic to neurons. Evidence supports that the unregulated activation of microglia in response to environmental toxins, endogenous proteins, and neuronal death results in the production of toxic factors that propagate neuronal injury. In the following review, we discuss the common thread of microglial activation across numerous neurodegenerative diseases, define current perceptions of how microglia are damaging neurons, and explain how the microglial response to neuronal damage results in a self-propelling cycle of neuron death.","The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is an integration centre between the central and peripheral autonomic nervous systems. It is involved in numerous functions from feeding, metabolic balance, blood pressure and heart rate, to erectile function and sexual behaviour. In particular, a group of oxytocinergic neurons originating in this nucleus and projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas (e.g., hippocampus, medulla oblongata and spinal cord) control penile erection in male rats. Activation of these neurons by dopamine and its agonists, excitatory amino acids (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) or oxytocin itself, or by electrical stimulation leads to penile erection, while their inhibition by gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and its agonists or by opioid peptides and opiate-like drugs inhibits this sexual response. The activation of these neurons is secondary to the activation of nitric oxide synthase, which produces nitric oxide. Nitric oxide in turn causes, by a mechanism that is as yet unidentified, the release of oxytocin in extra-hypothalamic brain areas. Other compounds recently identified that facilitate penile erection by activating central oxytocinergic neurons are peptide analogues of hexarelin, a growth hormone releasing peptide, pro-VGF-derived peptides, endogenous peptides that may be released by neuronal nerve endings impinging on oxytocinergic cell bodies, SR 141716A, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, and, less convincingly, adrenocorticotropin-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (ACTH-MSH)-related peptides. Paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons and similar mechanisms are also involved in penile erection occurring in physiological contexts, namely noncontact erections that occur in male rats in the presence of an inaccessible receptive female, and during copulation. These findings show that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus plays an important role in the control of erectile function and sexual activity. As the male rat is a model of sexual behaviour and penile physiology, which has largely increased in the last years our knowledge of peripheral and central mechanisms controlling erectile function (drugs that induce penile erection in male rats usually do so also in man), the above results may have great significance in terms of a human perspective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a protective mechanism for the brain by preventing entry of potentially harmful substances from free access to the central nervous system (CNS). Tight junctions present between the brain microvessel endothelial cells form a diffusion barrier, which selectively excludes most blood-borne substances from entering the brain. Astrocytic end-feet tightly ensheath the vessel wall and appear to be critical for the induction and maintenance of the barrier properties of the brain capillary endothelial cells. Because of these properties, the BBB only allows entry of lipophilic compounds with low molecular weights by passive diffusion. However, many lipophilic drugs show negligible brain uptake. They are substrates for drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) that are expressed at brain capillary endothelial cells and/or astrocytic end-feet and are key elements of the molecular machinery that confers the special permeability properties to the BBB. The combined action of these carrier systems results in rapid efflux of xenobiotics from the CNS. The objective of this review is to summarize transporter characteristics (cellular localization, specificity, regulation, and potential inhibition) for drug efflux transport systems identified in the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. A variety of experimental approaches available to ascertain or predict the impact of efflux transport on brain access of therapeutic drugs also are described and critically discussed. The potential impact of efflux transport on the pharmacodynamics of agents acting in the CNS is illustrated. Furthermore, the current knowledge about drug efflux transporters as a major determinant of multidrug resistance of brain diseases such as epilepsy is reviewed. Finally, we summarize strategies for modulating or by-passing drug efflux transporters at the BBB as novel therapeutic approaches to drug-resistant brain diseases.","Amphetamine and substituted amphetamines, including methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), and the herbs khat and ephedra, encompass the only widely administered class of drugs that predominantly release neurotransmitter, in this case principally catecholamines, by a non-exocytic mechanism. These drugs play important medicinal and social roles in many cultures, exert profound effects on mental function and behavior, and can produce neurodegeneration and addiction. Numerous questions remain regarding the unusual molecular mechanisms by which these compounds induce catecholamine release. We review current issues on the two apparent primary mechanisms--the redistribution of catecholamines from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol, and induction of reverse transport of transmitter through plasma membrane uptake carriers--and on additional drug effects that affect extracellular catecholamine levels, including uptake inhibition, effects on exocytosis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and metabolism.","Interest in interaction between the vestibular system and the hippocampus was stimulated by evidence that peripheral vestibular lesions could impair performance in learning and memory tasks requiring spatial information processing. By the 1990s, electrophysiological data were emerging that the brainstem vestibular nucleus complex (VNC) and the hippocampus were connected polysynaptically and that hippocampal place cells could respond to vestibular stimulation. The aim of this review is to summarise and critically evaluate research published in the last 5 years that has seen major progress in understanding the effects of vestibular damage on the hippocampus. In addition to new behavioural studies demonstrating that animals with vestibular lesions exhibit impairments in spatial memory tasks, electrophysiological studies have confirmed long-latency, polysynaptic pathways between the VNC and the hippocampus. Peripheral vestibular lesions have been shown to cause long-term changes in place cell function, hippocampal EEG activity and even CA1 field potentials in brain slices maintained in vitro. During the same period, neurochemical investigations have shown that some hippocampal subregions exhibit long-term changes in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, arginase I and II, and the NR1 and NR2A N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits following peripheral vestibular damage. Despite the progress, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as the possible contribution of auditory damage associated with vestibular lesions, to the hippocampal effects observed. Furthermore, although these studies demonstrate that damage to the vestibular system does have a long-term impact on the electrophysiological and neurochemical function of the hippocampus, they do not indicate precisely how vestibular information might be used in hippocampal functions such as developing spatial representations of the environment. Understanding this will require detailed electrical stimulation and lesion studies to elucidate the way in which different kinds of vestibular information are transmitted to various hippocampal subregions.","Actual fields of research in neurobiology are not only aimed at understanding the different aspects of brain aging but also at developing strategies useful to preserve brain compensatory capacity and to prevent the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Consistent with this trend much attention has been addressed to zinc metabolism. In fact, zinc acts as a neuromodulator at excitatory synapses and has a considerable role in the stress response and in the functionality of zinc-dependent enzymes contributing to maintaining brain compensatory capacity. In particular, the mechanisms that modulate the free zinc pool are pivotal for safeguarding brain health and performance. Alterations in zinc homeostasis have been reported in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease as well as in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures and traumatic brain injury, but little is known regarding aged brain. There is much evidence that that age-related changes, frequently associated to a decline in brain functions and impaired cognitive performances, could be related to dysfunctions affecting the intracellular zinc ion availability. A general agreement emerges from studies of humans' and rodents' old brains about an increased expression of metallothionein (MT) isoforms I and II, but dyshomogenous results are reported for MT-III, and it is still uncertain whether these proteins maintain in aging the protective role, as it occurs in adult/young age. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that amyloid-beta deposition in Alzheimer's disease is induced by zinc, but the pathological significance and the causes of this phenomenon are still an open question. The scientific debate on the role of zinc and of some zinc-binding proteins in aging and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as on the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in aged brain and neurodegeneration, is extensively discussed in this review.","Focal brain lesions can lead to metabolic and structural changes in areas distant from but connected to the lesion site. After focal ischemic or excitotoxic lesions of the cortex and/or striatum, secondary changes have been observed in the thalamus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, hippocampus and spinal cord. In all these regions, inflammatory changes characterized by activation of microglia and astrocytes appear. In the thalamus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and hippocampus, an expression of proinflammatory cytokine like tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta is induced. However, time course of expression and cellular localisation differ between these regions. Neuronal damage has consistently been observed in the thalamus, substantia nigra and spinal cord. It can be present in the hippocampus depending on the procedure of induction of focal cerebral ischemia. This secondary neuronal damage has been linked to antero- and retrograde degeneration. Anterograde degeneration is associated with somewhat later expression of cytokines, which is localised in neurons. In case of retrograde degeneration, the expression of cytokines is earlier and is localised in astrocytes. Pharmacological intervention aiming at reducing expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha leads to reduction of secondary neuronal damage. These first results suggest that the inflammatory changes in remote areas might be involved in the pathogenesis of secondary neuronal damage.","Recent work in neuroscience has shown that the adult central nervous system contains neural progenitors, precursors, and stem cells that are capable of generating new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. While challenging previous dogma that no new neurons are born in the adult mammalian CNS, these findings bring with them future possibilities for the development of novel neural repair strategies. The purpose of this review is to present current knowledge about constitutively occurring adult mammalian neurogenesis, to highlight the critical differences between ""neurogenic"" and ""non-neurogenic"" regions in the adult brain, and to describe the cardinal features of two well-described neurogenic regions-the subventricular zone/olfactory bulb system, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We also provide an overview of currently used models for studying neural precursors in vitro, mention some precursor transplantation models, and emphasize that, in this rapidly growing field of neuroscience, one must take caution with respect to a variety of methodological considerations for studying neural precursor cells both in vitro and in vivo. The possibility of repairing neural circuitry by manipulating neurogenesis is an intriguing one, and, therefore, we also review recent efforts to understand the conditions under which neurogenesis can be induced in non-neurogenic regions of the adult CNS. This work aims toward molecular and cellular manipulation of endogenous neural precursors in situ, without transplantation. We conclude this review with a discussion of what the function might be of newly generated neurons in the adult brain and provide a summary of current thinking about the consequences of disturbed adult neurogenesis and the reaction of neurogenic regions to disease.","Stroke interferes with voluntary control of motor actions. Although spontaneous recovery of function can occur, restoration of normal motor function in the hemiplegic upper limb is noted in fewer than 15% of individuals. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that in addition to injury-related reorganization, motor cortex functions can be altered by individual motor experiences. Such neural plasticity has major implications for the type of rehabilitative training administered post-stroke. This review proposes that noteworthy upper extremity gains toward motor recovery evolve from activity-dependent intervention based on theoretical motor control constructs and interlimb coordination principles. Founded on behavioral and neurophysiological mechanisms, bilateral movement training/practice has shown great promise in expediting progress toward chronic stroke recovery in the upper extremity. Planning and executing bilateral movements post-stroke may facilitate cortical neural plasticity by three mechanisms: (a) motor cortex disinhibition that allows increased use of the spared pathways of the damaged hemisphere, (b) increased recruitment of the ipsilateral pathways from the contralesional or contralateral hemisphere to supplement the damaged crossed corticospinal pathways, and (c) upregulation of descending premotorneuron commands onto propriospinal neurons.","Elements expressing the molecular mechanisms of gustatory transduction have been described in several organs in the digestive and respiratory apparatuses. These taste cell-related elements are isolated cells, which are not grouped in buds, and they have been interpreted as chemoreceptors. Their presence in epithelia of endodermal origin suggests the existence of a diffuse chemosensory system (DCS) sharing common signaling mechanisms with the ""classic"" taste organs. The elements of this taste cell-related DCS display a site-related morphologic polymorphism, and in the past they have been indicated with various names (e.g., brush, tuft, caveolated, fibrillo-vesicular or solitary chemosensory cells). It may be that the taste cell-related DCS is like an iceberg: the taste buds are probably only the most visible portion, with most of the iceberg more caudally located in the form of solitary chemosensory cells or chemosensory clusters. Comparative anatomical studies in lower vertebrates suggest that this 'submerged' portion may represent the most phylogenetically ancient component of the system, which is probably involved in defensive or digestive mechanisms. In the taste buds, the presence of several cell subtypes and of a wide range of molecular mechanisms permits precise food analysis. The larger, 'submerged' portion of the iceberg is composed of a polymorphic population of isolated elements or cell clusters in which the molecular cascade of cell signaling needs to be explored in detail. The little data we have strongly suggests a close relationship with taste cells. Morphological and biochemical considerations suggest that the DCS is a potential new drug target. Modulation of the respiratory and digestive apparatuses through substances, which act on the molecular receptors of this chemoreceptive system, could be a new frontier in drug discovery.","Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is the parent compound of a family of natural and synthetic compounds, the retinoids. Retinoids regulate gene transcription in numerous cells and tissues by binding to nuclear retinoid receptor proteins, which act as transcription factors. Much of the research conducted on retinoid signalling in the nervous system has focussed on developmental effects in the embryonic or early postnatal brain. Here, we review the increasing body of evidence indicating that retinoid signalling plays an important role in the function of the mature brain. Components of the metabolic pathway for retinoids have been identified in adult brain tissues, suggesting that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can be synthesized in discrete regions of the brain. The distribution of retinoid receptor proteins in the adult nervous system is different from that seen during development; and suggests that retinoid signalling is likely to have a physiological role in adult cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and associated brain regions. A number of neuronal specific genes contain recognition sequences for the retinoid receptor proteins and can be directly regulated by retinoids. Disruption of retinoid signalling pathways in rodent models indicates their involvement in regulating synaptic plasticity and associated learning and memory behaviours. Retinoid signalling pathways have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. Overall, the data underscore the likely importance of adequate nutritional Vitamin A status for adult brain function and highlight retinoid signalling pathways as potential novel therapeutic targets for neurological diseases.","Acetaldehyde has long been suggested to be involved in a number of ethanol's pharmacological and behavioral effects, such as its reinforcing, aversive, sedative, amnesic and stimulant properties. However, the role of acetaldehyde in ethanol's effects has been an extremely controversial topic during the past two decades. Opinions ranged from those virtually denying any role for acetaldehyde in ethanol's effects to those who claimed that alcoholism is in fact ""acetaldehydism"". Considering the possible key role of acetaldehyde in alcohol addiction, it is critical to clarify the respective functions of acetaldehyde and ethanol molecules in the pharmacological and behavioral effects of alcohol consumption. In the present paper, we review the animal studies reporting evidence that acetaldehyde is involved in the pharmacological and behavioral effects of ethanol. A number of studies demonstrated that acetaldehyde administration induces a range of behavioral effects. Other pharmacological studies indicated that acetaldehyde might be critically involved in several effects of ethanol consumption, including its reinforcing consequences. However, conflicting evidence has also been published. Furthermore, it remains to be shown whether pharmacologically relevant concentrations of acetaldehyde are achieved in the brain after alcohol consumption in order to induce significant effects. Finally, we review current evidence about the central mechanisms of action of acetaldehyde.","Despite our present knowledge of some of the cellular pathways that modulate central nervous system injury, complete therapeutic prevention or reversal of acute or chronic neuronal injury has not been achieved. The cellular mechanisms that precipitate these diseases are more involved than initially believed. As a result, identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cellular injury would be extremely beneficial to reduce or eliminate disability from nervous system disorders. Current studies have begun to focus on pathways of oxidative stress that involve a variety of cellular pathways. Here we discuss novel pathways that involve the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, apoptotic injury that leads to nuclear degradation in both neuronal and vascular populations, and the early loss of cellular membrane asymmetry that mitigates inflammation and vascular occlusion. Current work has identified exciting pathways, such as the Wnt pathway and the serine-threonine kinase Akt, as central modulators that oversee cellular apoptosis and their downstream substrates that include Forkhead transcription factors, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, mitochondrial dysfunction, Bad, and Bcl-x(L). Other closely integrated pathways control microglial activation, release of inflammatory cytokines, and caspase and calpain activation. New therapeutic avenues that are just open to exploration, such as with brain temperature regulation, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide modulation, metabotropic glutamate system modulation, and erythropoietin targeted expression, may provide both attractive and viable alternatives to treat a variety of disorders that include stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury.","Dendritic spines are small protrusions that cover the surface of dendrites and bear the postsynaptic component of excitatory synapses. Having an enlarged head connected to the dendrite by a narrow neck, dendritic spines provide a postsynaptic biochemical compartment that separates the synaptic space from the dendritic shaft and allows each spine to function as a partially independent unit. Spines develop around the time of synaptogenesis and are dynamic structures that continue to undergo remodeling over time. Changes in spine morphology and density influence the properties of neural circuits. Our knowledge of the structure and function of dendritic spines has progressed significantly since their discovery over a century ago, but many uncertainties still remain. For example, several different models have been put forth outlining the sequence of events that lead to the genesis of a spine. Although spines are small and apparently simple organelles with a cytoskeleton mainly composed of actin filaments, regulation of their morphology and physiology appears to be quite sophisticated. A multitude of molecules have been implicated in dendritic spine development and remodeling, suggesting that intricate networks of interconnected signaling pathways converge to regulate actin dynamics in spines. This complexity is not surprising, given the likely importance of dendritic spines in higher brain functions. In this review, we discuss the molecules that are currently known to mediate the exquisite sensitivity of spines to perturbations in their environment and we outline how these molecules interface with each other to mediate cascades of signals flowing from the spine surface to the actin cytoskeleton.","Evolutionarily older brain systems, such as the limbic system, appear to serve fundamental aspects of emotional processing and provide relevant and motivational information for phylogenetically more recent brain systems to regulate complex behaviors. Overall, overt behavior is, in part, determined by the interactions of multiple learning and memory systems, some seemingly complementary and some actually competitive. An understanding of limbic system function in emotion and motivation requires that these subsystems be recognized and characterized as extended components of a distributed limbic network. Behavioral neuroscientists face the challenge of teasing apart the contributions of multiple overlapping neuronal systems in order to begin to elucidate the neural mechanisms of the limbic system and their contributions to behavior. One major consideration is to bring together conceptually the functions of individual components of the limbic forebrain and the related limbic midbrain systems. For example, in the rat the heterogeneous regions of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., prelimbic, anterior cingulate, subgenual cortices and orbito-frontal areas) make distinct contributions to emotional and motivational influences on behavior and each needs consideration in its own right. Major interacting structures of the limbic system include the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdaloid nuclear complex, limbic thalamus, hippocampal formation, nucleus accumbens (limbic striatum), anterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and midbrain raphe nuclei; the latter comprising largely serotonergic components of the limbic midbrain system projecting to the forebrain. The posterior limbic midbrain complex comprising the stria medullaris, central gray and dorsal and ventral nuclei of Gudden are also key elements in the limbic midbrain. Some of these formations will be discussed in terms of the neurochemical connectivity between them. We put forward a systems approach in order to build a network model of the limbic forebrain/limbic midbrain system, and the interactions of its major components. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the limbic system is both an anatomical entity as well as a physiological concept. We have considered this issue in detail in the introduction to this review. The components of these systems have usually been considered as functional units or 'centers' rather than being components of a larger, interacting, and distributed functional system. In that context, we are oriented toward considerations of distributed neural systems themselves as functional entities in the brain.","The intrinsic and network properties of thalamic reticular (RE) neurons, which release the potent inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), endow them with oscillatory properties within the frequency range of sleep spindles (7-15 Hz), a hallmark brain rhythm that characterizes early sleep stages. The original hypothesis that RE neurons are pacemakers of spindles, based on absence of this oscillation in thalamocortical (TC) systems after disconnection from RE nucleus and presence of spindle rhythmicity in the deafferented RE nucleus, is supported by new experimental results in vivo, in vitro and in computo showing that interactions through chemical synapses as well as electrical coupling among inhibitory RE neurons lead to generation and synchronization of spindle sequences within the nucleus. Besides their pacemaking role in spindle generation, RE neurons are crucially implicated in the inhibition of TC neurons during cortically generated spike-wave (absence) seizures, which may explain the obliteration of signals from the external world and unconsciousness during these epileptic fits.","Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment produced in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. It appears in greatest quantities in the human brain, in lesser amounts in some other non-human primates, but is absent from the brain in many lower species. Interest in this pigment has seen a resurgence in recent years because of a hypothesised link between neuromelanin and the especial vulnerability of neuromelanin-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Little is known regarding the biology of neuromelanin. As neuromelanin appears to have characteristics in common with the better studied peripheral melanin pigments this review compares what is known about neuromelanin with melanins found in other body tissues. Unlike peripheral melanins, which are produced in specialised cells called melanocytes and may be transferred to other cell types, neuromelanin granules are believed to be stored in the cell in which they are produced. Neuromelanin granules display a unique, more heterogeneous appearance compared with peripheral melanins. Unlike melanin, neuromelanin is traditionally thought to result from a non-enzymatic synthesis pathway with no known pathway for neuromelanin catabolism. More recent data, however, is indicative of some regulation of neuromelanin synthesis and turnover. By analogy with peripheral melanins, neuromelanin may function in vivo to attenuate the effects of damaging stimuli. Among several possible mechanisms suggested, the ability of neuromelanin to interact with transition metals, especially iron, and to mediate intracellular oxidative mechanisms has received particular attention. Recent data from neuromelanin in the Parkinson's disease brain suggests that this proposed function may be compromised, thus rendering pigmented neurons vulnerable to oxidative damage in this disorder.","Synaptic plasticity is a term that describes long-lasting changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission resulting from certain patterned activities of the presynaptic nerve. One form of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), is an activity-dependent marked increase in synaptic efficacy that has been extensively studied in various regions of the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus, where LTP is widely believed to be a cellular correlate of learning and memory. A similar phenomenon has been identified in sympathetic ganglia even before Bliss and Lomo coined the term LTP in 1973. Ganglionic LTP (gLTP) of the nicotinic pathway is a similarly long-lasting increase in synaptic effectiveness that can be induced in ganglia following a brief train of relatively high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the preganglionic nerve. Remarkably similar to the LTP of the hippocampus, gLTP has been demonstrated in autonomic ganglia from a number of vertebrates including mammalian, amphibian and avian species. Several other forms of long-lasting increases in synaptic effectiveness have been demonstrated in sympathetic ganglia following exposure to adrenergic agonists, neuroactive peptides and cyclic nucleotides and even after a challenge by an antigen. The main emphasis of this review, however, will be on the activity-dependent gLTP of the mammalian sympathetic ganglia, in particular the superior cervical ganglion of the rat. Since the last, excellent and comprehensive review of this ganglionic function by Briggs in 1995, important discoveries about the mechanisms of induction and maintenance of gLTP have been reported, including the finding that the response is uniquely dependent on serotonin for both the induction phase and maintenance phase. These new advances will be discussed in depth in this review.","Multivariate time series analysis is extensively used in neurophysiology with the aim of studying the relationship between simultaneously recorded signals. Recently, advances on information theory and nonlinear dynamical systems theory have allowed the study of various types of synchronization from time series. In this work, we first describe the multivariate linear methods most commonly used in neurophysiology and show that they can be extended to assess the existence of nonlinear interdependence between signals. We then review the concepts of entropy and mutual information followed by a detailed description of nonlinear methods based on the concepts of phase synchronization, generalized synchronization and event synchronization. In all cases, we show how to apply these methods to study different kinds of neurophysiological data. Finally, we illustrate the use of multivariate surrogate data test for the assessment of the strength (strong or weak) and the type (linear or nonlinear) of interdependence between neurophysiological signals.","Autism is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by marked impairments in social interactions and communication, with restricted stereotypic and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Genetic epidemiology studies indicate that a strong genetic component exists to this disease, but these same studies also implicate significant environmental influence. The disorder also displays symptomatologic heterogeneity, with broad individual differences and severity on a graded continuum. In the search for phenotypes to resolve heterogeneity and better grasp autism's underlying biology, investigators have noted a statistical overrepresentation of macrocephaly, an indicator of enlarged brain volume. This feature is one of the most widely replicated biological findings in autism. What then does brain enlargement signify? One hypothesis invoked for the origin of macrocephaly is a reduction in neuronal pruning and consolidation of synapses during development resulting in an overabundance of neurites. An increase in generation of cells is an additional mechanism for macrocephaly, though it is less frequently discussed in the literature. Here, we review neurodevelopmental mechanisms regulating brain growth and highlight one underconsidered potential causal mechanism for autism and macrocephaly--an increase in neurogenesis and/or gliogenesis. We review factors known to control these processes with an emphasis on nuclear receptor activation as one signaling control that may be abnormal and contribute to increased brain volume in autistic disorders.","A large part of mammalian proteomes is represented by hypothetical proteins (HP), i.e. proteins predicted from nucleic acid sequences only and protein sequences with unknown function. Databases are far from being complete and errors are expected. The legion of HP is awaiting experiments to show their existence at the protein level and subsequent bioinformatic handling in order to assign proteins a tentative function is mandatory. Two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis with subsequent mass spectrometrical identification of protein spots is an appropriate tool to search for HP in the high-throughput mode. Spots are identified by MS or by MS/MS measurements (MALDI-TOF, MALDI-TOF-TOF) and subsequent software as e.g. Mascot or ProFound. In many cases proteins can thus be unambiguously identified and characterised; if this is not the case, de novo sequencing or Q-TOF analysis is warranted. If the protein is not identified, the sequence is being sent to databases for BLAST searches to determine identities/similarities or homologies to known proteins. If no significant identity to known structures is observed, the protein sequence is examined for the presence of functional domains (databases PROSITE, PRINTS, InterPro, ProDom, Pfam and SMART), subjected to searches for motifs (ELM) and finally protein-protein interaction databases (InterWeaver, STRING) are consulted or predictions from conformations are performed. We here provide information about hypothetical proteins in terms of protein chemical analysis, independent of antibody availability and specificity and bioinformatic handling to contribute to the extension/completion of protein databases and include original work on HP in the brain to illustrate the processes of HP identification and functional assignment.","Axons within the adult mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate spontaneously after injury. Upon injury, the balance between growth promoting and growth inhibitory factors in the central nervous system dramatically changes resulting in the absence of regeneration. Axonal responses to injury vary considerably. In central nervous system regeneration studies, the spinal cord has received a lot of attention because of its relatively easy accessibility and its clinical relevance. The present review discusses the axon-tract-specific requirements for regeneration in the rat. This knowledge is very important for the development and optimalization of therapies to repair the injured spinal cord.","Nurr1, a transcription factor belonging to the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, is critical in the development and maintenance of the dopaminergic system and as such it may have role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson' disease (PD). Human Nurr1 gene has been mapped to chromosome 2q22-23 and Nurr1 protein is predominantly expressed in central dopaminergic neurons. Nurr1 interacts with other factors critical for the survival of mensencephalic dopaminergic neurons and it appears to regulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), all of which are important in the synthesis and storage of dopamine. Experimental studies in Nurr1 knock-out mice indicate that Nurr1 deficiency results in impaired dopaminergic function and increased vulnerability of those midbrain dopaminergic neurons that degenerate in PD. Decreased Nurr1 expression is found in the autopsied PD midbrains, particularly in neurons containing Lewy bodies, as well as in peripheral lymphocytes of patients with parkinsonian disorders. Several variants in Nurr1 gene have been reported in association with PD. All these studies suggest that Nurr1 is not only essential in the development of mensencephalic dopaminergic neurons and maintenance of their functions, but it may also play a role in the pathogenesis of PD.","GABA and the GABAA and GABAB receptors play a pivotal role in the coordination of the central vestibular pathways. The commissural inhibition, which exists between the two vestibular nucleus complexes (VNCs) and which is responsible for enhancing the dynamic sensitivity of VNC neurons to head acceleration, is known to be substantially mediated by GABA acting on GABAA and GABAB receptors. After unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD), the large asymmetry in spontaneous resting activity between the two VNCs is reinforced and exacerbated by the GABAergic interaction between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Although it has been suggested that reduced GABAergic inhibition of the ipsilateral VNC may be partially responsible for the recovery of resting activity that underlies vestibular compensation of the static symptoms of UVD, at present there are few data available to test this hypothesis systematically. There is some evidence that GABA concentrations change in the ipsilateral VNC during the development of compensation; however, it is unclear whether these changes relate to GABA release or to metabolic pools of GABA. Most biochemical studies of GABA receptors have been conducted at the gene expression level. Therefore, it is unclear whether changes in the receptor protein also occur, although the most recent data suggest that changes in GABAA and GABAB receptor density in the VNC are unlikely. The few radioligand binding data relate to GABAA receptors with benzodiazepine binding sites only. A decrease in the sensitivity of ipsilateral VNC neurons from compensated animals to GABA receptor agonists has been reported; however, these studies have employed brainstem slices and therefore the functional identity of the neurons involved has been unclear. Although it seems likely that some changes in central GABAergic systems accompany the recovery of resting activity in the ipsilateral VNC during the development of vestibular compensation, at the present stage there is no compelling evidence that these changes have a causal role in the compensation process.","Biologists have studied the expression of emotions in man and other animals since at least 1806, when Charles Bell published his Anatomy and Physiology of Expression. We trace the main experimental developments since that time, including Darwin's investigations into the evolution of innate forms of expression of emotions, as well as those into cognitive versus precognitive forms of expression of emotions. In particular, contemporary studies by neuroscientists into the origins of emotional experiences are detailed, especially emotional responses to faces showing different expressions, on which much research has been carried out. We examine the various claims made by these researchers as to what their experiments show. Our conceptual analysis indicates that there is considerable confusion as to what experimental work to this time indicates about the role of cortical and subcortical structures in the expression of emotions. We attempt to clarify what can and cannot be justified as established concerning the workings of the brain and emotions.","The antiepileptic activity associated with ketogenic diets (KD) have been known for some time. First reports date back to the Middle Ages and even Biblical times where KD was achieved by fasting (i.e. ""water diet"") [see Swink, T.D., Vining, E.P.G., Freeman, J.M., 1997. The ketogenic diet: 1997. Adv. Pediatr. 44, 297-329, and references therein]. In the early 20th century, changes in the design of the KD were introduced, shifting the so-called ""water diet"" to a high-fat diet. Initial clinical evaluations undertaken between the 1920s and 1940s were enthusiastic, but the popularity of the KD was retrograded upon clinical introduction of phenytoin and subsequently other antiepileptic drugs. Today, despite a pharmacological arsenal targeting cerebral receptors and specific events in seizure initiation and development, about 30-40% patients are still refractory to available medications. Thus, the KD has been re-introduced in recent years as an alternative therapy, averring to be efficacious against some instances of resistant or intractable epilepsy. Despite a long historical background and enlarged clinical use, identification of the underlying anticonvulsant mechanisms associated with this nonpharmacological approach is still in stagnation. The present review is an attempt to encourage current research orientation through well-based and directed proposals for putative emerging candidates mediating KD anticonvulsant mechanisms. The reader is provided with a special emphasis on ATP-sensitive and recently cloned two-pore (or tandem) domain potassium channels, as well as several emerging conceptual views and advances such as nuclear receptors, uncoupling proteins and gap junctions that the authors speculate may contribute to understanding the basic mechanisms linked to the KD.","Neuronal nicotinic receptors (NAChRs) form a heterogeneous family of ion channels that are differently expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. These different receptor subtypes, which have characteristic pharmacological and biophysical properties, have a pentameric structure consisting of the homomeric or heteromeric combination of 12 different subunits (alpha2-alpha10, beta2-beta4). By responding to the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine, NAChRs contribute to a wide range of brain activities and influence a number of physiological functions. Furthermore, it is becoming evident that the perturbation of cholinergic nicotinic neurotransmission can lead to various diseases involving nAChR dysfunction during development, adulthood and ageing. In recent years, it has been discovered that NAChRs are present in a number of non-neuronal cells where they play a significant functional role and are the pathogenetic targets in several diseases. NAChRs are also the target of natural ligands and toxins including nicotine (Nic), the most widespread drug of abuse. This review will attempt to survey the major achievements reached in the study of the structure and function of NAChRs by examining their regional and cellular localisation and the molecular basis of their functional diversity mainly in pharmacological and biochemical terms. The recent availability of mice with the genetic ablation of single or double nicotinic subunits or point mutations have shed light on the role of nAChRs in major physiological functions, and we will here discuss recent data relating to their behavioural phenotypes. Finally, the role of NAChRs in disease will be considered in some details.","The classical visual aura of migraine is characterized by a unilateral hallucination, composed of a zigzag fortification pattern followed by a trailing scotoma. This pattern usually starts in central vision, expands and spreads to the periphery, and then disappears. We review a number of historical attempts to explain the migraine aura in terms of brain events, then summarize recent theories of the pathophysiology of the aura. We describe an approach to the computational modeling of migraine aura, based on the principles of (a) cortical organization, and (b) active wave propagation in an excitable medium. We demonstrate correspondences between properties of the model system and aspects of the pathophysiology of the aura. The simulations produced by the model are in agreement with descriptions and drawings of visual aura from migraine patients. We outline several testable predictions stemming from the implementation of the model, and explain how model-based empirical research has the capacity to (a) improve recording of the phenomena of the visual aura, (b) improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of other types of aura, in particular somatosensory and dysphasic aurae, and (c) clarify the theoretical requirements for the initiation of aura in the brain.","This review is focused on the structure and function of Alzheimer's amyloid deposits. Amyloid formation is a process in which normal well-folded cellular proteins undergo a self-assembly process that leads to the formation of large and ordered protein structures. Amyloid deposition, oligomerization, and higher order polymerization, and the structure adopted by these assemblies, as well as their functional relationship with cell biology are underscored. Numerous efforts have been directed to elucidate these issues and their relation with senile dementia. Significant advances made in the last decade in amyloid structure, dynamics and cell biology are summarized and discussed. The mechanism of amyloid neurotoxicity is discussed with emphasis on the Wnt signaling pathway. This review is focused on Alzheimer's amyloid fibrils in general and has been divided into two parts dealing with the structure and function of amyloid.","One of the most common paradigms used to study the biological basis of emotion, as well as of learning and memory, is Pavlovian fear conditioning. In the acquisition phase of a fear conditioning experiment, an emotionally neutral conditioned stimulus (CS)--which can either be a discrete stimulus, such as a tone, or a contextual stimulus, such as a specific environment--is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), for example a foot shock. As a result, the CS elicits conditioned fear responses when subsequently presented alone during the expression phase of the experiment. While considerable work has been done in relating specific circuits of the brain to fear conditioning, less is known about its regulation by neuromodulators; the understanding of which would be of therapeutic relevance for fear related diseases such as phobia, panic attacks, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. Dopamine is one of the neuromodulators most potently acting on the mechanisms underlying states of fear and anxiety. Recently, a growing body of evidence has suggested that dopaminergic mechanisms are significant for different aspects of affective memory, namely its formation, expression, retrieval, and extinction. The aim of this review is to clarify the complex actions of dopamine in fear conditioning with respect to the wide-spread distribution of dopaminergic innervation over structures constituting the fear related circuitry. A particular effort is made to understand how dopamine in the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens--target structures of the mesolimbic dopamine system originating from the ventral tegmental area--could relate to different aspects of fear conditioning.","Long- and short-term changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission are known as synaptic plasticity. Phenomena such as long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) are two classical forms of synaptic plasticity that are expressed in several brain areas, including the striatum. Bi-directional changes in corticostriatal synaptic transmission, i.e. LTD and LTP, have been proposed to represent the cellular mechanisms underlying the physiological processes of motor learning and behavior. In parallel, other forms of synaptic plasticity induced by different experimental pathological conditions have been described in the striatum; these changes are presumed to represent the cellular processes underlying several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. A considerable number of receptor and post-receptor systems participate in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the striatum, where glutamate plays a primary role through its ionotropic and metabotropic receptors (mGluRs). These latter constitute a group of recently characterized molecules, which have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission by acting on cellular excitability, ionic conductances and neurotransmitter release. These receptors have also been involved in several neuronal pathophysiological processes. The role of mGluRs in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity has been recently deeply studied and characterized in the striatum, in both physiological and pathological conditions. These findings open new and interesting perspectives in the study of basal ganglia function, and introduce new possible pharmacological approaches for the treatment of neurological disorders in which mGluRs have been experimentally involved.","The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major protein quality control system in eukaryotic cells. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by aggregates and inclusions of aberrant proteins, implying a sub-optimal functioning or defective UPS. The last few years have seen increasing evidence for the involvement of the UPS in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, decreases in proteasome activity were detected in several cortical areas in AD patients. In addition, proteins that accumulate in the classical hallmarks of AD were linked to UPS function. This review specifically discusses the involvement of the UPS in AD pathogenesis. First, a detailed overview of the UPS is presented, after which AD pathology and its relation to the UPS is discussed.","The thalamocortical network consists of the pathways that interconnect the thalamus and neocortex, including thalamic sensory afferents, corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways. These pathways are essential to acquire, analyze, store and retrieve sensory information. However, sensory information processing mostly occurs during behavioral arousal, when activity in thalamus and neocortex consists of an electrographic sign of low amplitude fast activity, known as activation, which is caused by several neuromodulator systems that project to the thalamocortical network. Logically, in order to understand how the thalamocortical network processes sensory information it is essential to study its response properties during states of activation. This paper reviews the temporal and spatial response properties of synaptic pathways in the whisker thalamocortical network of rodents during activated states as compared to quiescent (non-activated) states. The evidence shows that these pathways are differentially regulated via the effects of neuromodulators as behavioral contingencies demand. Thus, during activated states, the temporal and spatial response properties of pathways in the thalamocortical network are transformed to allow the processing of sensory information.","Zif268 is a transcription regulatory protein, the product of an immediate early gene. Zif268 was originally described as inducible in cell cultures; however, it was later shown to be activated by a variety of stimuli, including ongoing synaptic activity in the adult brain. Recently, mice with experimentally mutated zif268 gene have been obtained and employed in neurobiological research. In this review we present a critical overview of Zif268 expression patterns in the naive brain and following neuronal stimulation as well as functional data with Zif268 mutants. In conclusion, we suggest that Zif268 expression and function should be considered in a context of neuronal activity that is tightly linked to neuronal plasticity.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) create major learning barriers for children and significant social and legal handicaps for adults worldwide. Important advances in the genetic basis of the disease have been made, but reliable, biological, diagnostic markers remain elusive. This review takes the position that future progress in treating the core symptom of attention deficits requires a clearer understanding of the neuroscience of attention in normal individuals. Two important achievements in this direction have been the development of tasks that identify activity in the orienting, alerting and conflict networks, and the identification of neurotransmitters that mediate these components. The proven ability of these tasks to identify and characterize response components of ""normal"" attention argues that they could be used advantageously with patient populations. The categorization of neurotransmitter abnormalities in those with ADHD could clarify whether attention deficits occur within or across attention networks. To realize these goals, we evaluate laboratory studies of attention in humans and animals that address the underlying neurotransmitter systems, primarily norepinephrine and acetylcholine. We propose that key facts about deficits in reflexive and voluntary attention may be understood by a model that includes deficits in brain norepinephrine release and its effects on cholinergic activity in the parietal cortex.","The supramammillary area of the hypothalamus, although small in size, can have profound modulatory effects on the hippocampal formation and related temporal cortex. It can control hippocampal plasticity and also has recently been shown to contain cells that determine the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (theta rhythm). We review here its organization and anatomical connections providing an atlas and a new nomenclature. We then review its functions particularly in relation to its links with the hippocampus. Much of its control of behaviour and its differential activation by specific classes of stimuli is consistent with a tight relationship with the hippocampus. However, its ascending connections involve not only caudal areas of the cortex with close links to the hippocampus but also reciprocal connections with more rostral areas such as the infralimbic and anterior cingulate cortices. These latter areas appear to be the most rostral part of a network that, via the medial septum, hippocampus and lateral septum, is topographically mapped into the hypothalamus. The supramammillary area is thus diffusely connected with areas that control emotion and cognition and receives more topographically specific return information from areas that control cognition while also receiving ascending information from brain stem areas involved in emotion. We suggest that it is a key part of a network that recursively transforms information to achieve integration of cognitive and emotional aspects of goal-directed behaviour.","Since the discovery in the 1970s that dendritic abnormalities in cortical pyramidal neurons are the most consistent pathologic correlate of mental retardation, research has focused on how dendritic alterations are related to reduced intellectual ability. Due in part to obvious ethical problems and in part to the lack of fruitful methods to study neuronal circuitry in the human cortex, there is little data about the microanatomical contribution to mental retardation. The recent identification of the genetic bases of some mental retardation associated alterations, coupled with the technology to create transgenic animal models and the introduction of powerful sophisticated tools in the field of microanatomy, has led to a growth in the studies of the alterations of pyramidal cell morphology in these disorders. Studies of individuals with Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder leading to mental retardation, allow the analysis of the relationships between cognition, genotype and brain microanatomy. In Down syndrome the crucial question is to define the mechanisms by which an excess of normal gene products, in interaction with the environment, directs and constrains neural maturation, and how this abnormal development translates into cognition and behaviour. In the present article we discuss mainly Down syndrome-associated dendritic abnormalities and plasticity and the role of animal models in these studies. We believe that through the further development of such approaches, the study of the microanatomical substrates of mental retardation will contribute significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human brain disorders associated with mental retardation.","Anatomical data indicate that the parahippocampal region, comprised of the perirhinal (PRC), postrhinal (POR) and entorhinal (ERC) cortices, is an essential link between neocortex and hippocampus. Lesion studies demonstrated that memory functions previously ascribed to the hippocampus depend on the integrity of the rhinal cortices. This review will consider recent data suggesting that the ERC and PRC, far from being passive relay stations, actively gate impulse traffic between neocortex and hippocampus, because they are endowed with a powerful intrinsic inhibitory system. It is proposed that the cross-talk between PRC and ERC is not organized to unrestrictedly transfer information, but to select relevant inputs. The implication of these new evidences for the propagation of epileptiform activity will be considered.","The subventricular zones (SVZs) are essential sources of new cells in the developing brain and remnants of these germinal zones persist into adulthood. As these cells have the capacity to replenish neurons and glia that are turning over, many investigators have assessed the SVZ's role in replacing neural cells eliminated by brain injuries. A review of the literature reveals that the progenitors within the SVZs are vulnerable to chemical, radiation and ischemia-induced damage, whereas the neural stem cells are resilient. With moderate insults, the SVZ can recover, but it cannot recover after more severe injury. Thus, the vulnerability of these cells has important ramifications when considering therapeutic interventions for the treatment of brain tumors and for the prospect of recovery after ischemia. The cells of the perinatal and adult SVZ not only have the capacity to replenish their own numbers, but they also have the capacity to replace neurons and glia after ischemic and traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying these regenerative responses are beginning to be revealed. By reviewing, comparing and contrasting the responses of the SVZs to different injuries, our goal is to provide a foundation from which current and future studies on the potential of the SVZs for cell replacement can be evaluated.","Circadian rhythms are internally generated circa 24 h rhythms. The phase of the circadian pacemaker in mammals can be adjusted by external stimuli such as the daily cycle of light, as well as by internal stimuli such as information related to the physiological and behavioral status of the organism, collectively called ""non-photic stimuli"". We review a large number of studies regarding photic-non-photic interactions on the circadian system, with special focus on two widely described neurotransmitters associated with non-photic input pathways: neuropeptide Y (NPY) and serotonin 5-HT. Both neurotransmitters are capable of phase advancing the master pacemaker oscillation when applied during the subjective day, as do several behavioral manipulations. Also, both are capable of inhibiting light-induced phase shifts during the subjective night, suggesting a dynamic interaction between photic and non-photic stimuli in the fine-tuning of the pacemaker function. Suppression of the NPYergic and/or serotonergic non-photic input pathways can in turn potentiate the phase-shifting effects of light. These findings pose new questions about the possibility of a physiological role for the dynamic interaction between photic and non-photic inputs. This might be particularly important in the case of circadian system adjustments under certain conditions, such as depression, shift work or jet lag.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2004 Dec;74(5):321.,"Production of energy for the maintenance of ionic disequilibria necessary for generation and transmission of nerve impulses is one of the primary functions of the brain. This review attempts to link the plethora of information on the maturation of the central nervous system with the ontogeny of ATP metabolism, placing special emphasis on variations that occur during development in different brain regions and across the mammalian species. It correlates morphological events and markers with biochemical changes in activities of enzymes and pathways that participate in the production of ATP. The paper also evaluates alterations in energy levels as a function of age and, based on the tenet that ATP synthesis and utilization cannot be considered in isolation, investigates maturational profiles of the key processes that utilize energy. Finally, an attempt is made to assess the relevance of currently available animal models to improvement of our understanding of the etiopathology of various disease states in the human infant. This is deemed essential for the development and testing of novel strategies for prevention and treatment of several severe neurological deficits.","This review addresses three principal questions about adenosine and sleep-wake regulation: (1) Is adenosine an endogenous sleep factor? (2) Are there specific brain regions/neuroanatomical targets and receptor subtypes through which adenosine mediates sleepiness? (3) What are the molecular mechanisms by which adenosine may mediate the long-term effects of sleep loss? Data suggest that adenosine is indeed an important endogenous, homeostatic sleep factor, likely mediating the sleepiness that follows prolonged wakefulness. The cholinergic basal forebrain is reviewed in detail as an essential area for mediating the sleep-inducing effects of adenosine by inhibition of wake-promoting neurons via the A1 receptor. The A2A receptor in the subarachnoid space below the rostral forebrain may play a role in the prostaglandin D2-mediated somnogenic effects of adenosine. Recent evidence indicates that a cascade of signal transduction induced by basal forebrain adenosine A1 receptor activation in cholinergic neurons leads to increased transcription of the A1 receptor; this may play a role in mediating the longer-term effects of sleep deprivation, often called sleep debt.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenetic condition that affects the processes via which the brain functions. Major observable hallmarks of AD are accumulated clusters of proteins in the brain. These clusters, termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), resemble pairs of threads wound around each other in a helix fashion accumulating within neurons. These tangles consist of a protein called Tau, which binds to tubulin, thus forming microtubules. Unlike NFTs, deposits of amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) gather in the spaces between nerve cells. The nearby neurons often look swollen and deformed, and the clusters of protein are usually accompanied by reactive inflammatory cells, microglia, which are part of the brain's immune system responsible for degrading and removing damaged neurons or plaques. Since phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms are crucial in the regulation of Tau and beta-APP, a superfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has recently emerged as key regulators of the formation of plagues, eventually leading to dementia and AD. The complex molecular interactions between MAPKs and proteins (plagues) associated with the evolution of AD form a cornerstone in the knowledge of a still burgeoning field of neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. This review overviews current understanding of the molecular pathways related to MAPKs and their role in the development of AD and, possibly, dementia. MAPKs, therefore, may constitute a neurogenetic, therapeutic target for the diagnosis and evolution of a preventative medical strategy for early detection, and likely treatment, of Alzheimer's.","A proteolytic pathway in which attachment of a small protein, ubiquitin, marks the substrates for degradation by a multi-subunit complex called the proteasome has been shown to function in synaptic plasticity and in several other physiological processes of the nervous system. Attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates occurs through a series of highly specific and regulated steps. Degradation by the proteasome is subject to multiple levels of regulation as well. How does the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway contribute to synaptic plasticity? Long-lasting, protein synthesis-dependent, changes in the synaptic strength occur through activation of molecular cascades in the nucleus in coordination with signaling events in specific synapses. Available evidence indicates that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation has a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity that operate in the nucleus as well as at the synapse. Since the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to be versatile in having roles in addition to proteolysis in several other cellular processes relevant to synaptic plasticity, such as endocytosis and transcription, this pathway is highly suited for a localized role in the neuron. Because of its numerous roles, malfunctioning of this pathway leads to several diseases and disorders of the nervous system. In this review, I examine the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in detail and describe the role of regulated proteolysis in long-term synaptic plasticity. Also, using synaptic tagging theory of synapse-specific plasticity, I provide a model on the possible roles and regulation of local protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","Locomotion is associated with a number of optical consequences that degrade visual information processing in the absence of appropriate compensatory movements. The resulting retinal image flow is counteracted by coordinated eye-head reflexes that are initiated by optokinetic and vestibular inputs. The contribution of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) for stabilizing retinal images is relatively small in amplitude in frogs but important in function by compensating for the non-linearities of the neck motor system. The spatial tuning of the VOR networks underlying the angular (AVOR) and linear (LVOR) with respect to canal and extraocular motor coordinates is organized in a common, canal-related reference frame. Thereby, the axes of head and eye rotation are aligned, principle and auxiliary VOR connections transform vestibular into motor signals and parallel AVOR and LVOR circuits mediate vergence and version signals separately. Comparison of these results with data from other vertebrates demonstrates a number of fundamental organization principles common to most vertebrates. However, the fewer degrees of behavioral freedom of frogs are reflected by the absence of, e.g. a functioning velocity storage network or of a fixation suppression of the VOR. In vitro experiments with the isolated brainstem and branches of N.VIII attached were used to study the putative transmitters of vestibular nerve afferent inputs, the postsynaptic receptor subtypes of second-order vestibular neurons and their dynamic response properties. Evidence is presented that suggests that afferent vestibular nerve fibers with different dynamic response properties activate different subtypes of glutamate receptors. The convergence pattern of monosynaptic afferent nerve inputs from different labyrinthine organs onto second-order vestibular neurons is remarkably specific. As a rule, second-order vestibular neurons receive converging afferent nerve inputs from one semicircular canal and from a specific sector of hair cells on one otolith organ. This convergence pattern remains malleable even in adulthood and reorganization is initiated by activity-related changes in vestibular nerve afferent fibers. The output of second-order vestibular neurons is modified by at least three inhibitory control loops. Uncrossed inhibitory vestibular side loops appear to control specifically the dynamic response tuning, whereas coplanar commissural inhibitory inputs improve mainly the spatial tuning and the cerebellar feedback loop controls the response gain. Among the targets of second-order vestibular projection neurons are extraocular motoneurons and internuclear neurons. Extraocular motoneurons differ among each other by the presence of very different response dynamics. These differences may represent a co-adaptation to the response dynamics of twitch and non-twitch extraocular muscle fibers. Different dynamical properties are required for a rapid acceleration of the globe at the one end and for the maintenance of a stable eccentric eye position over long periods of time at the other end of a continuum of variations in dynamic response properties. The maintenance of a given eccentric eye position over long periods of time is especially well developed in frogs and assists visual surveillance during lurking in the absence of saccades.","Our understanding of neuronal cell biology in the last 10 years has exploded. In parallel, our grasp of basic cellular processes, such as protein synthesis and protein degradation has also grown exponentially. In this review, we provide an in-depth background to details of current knowledge of the Ub/proteasome pathway. We also provide examples of recent experiments in neurobiology that suggest a central role for targeted protein degradation by the Ub/proteasome pathway to ensure proper neuronal function. From the examples provided, it is clear the activity of the proteasome is required for neuronal pathfinding during development, regulation of synaptic branching and number, and synaptic plasticity. We conclude with a discussion of how defects in proteasome pathway function may lead to neuronal dysfunction, with specific emphasis on diseases characterized by the accumulation of ubiquitin (Ub)-positive inclusions. Our goal is to excite the expert neurobiologist to the myriad ways that specific neuronal functions could be regulated (or dysregulated) by mechanisms involving the Ub/proteasome pathway.","The role of dopaminergic systems in the control of sexual behavior has been a subject of study for at least 40 years. Not surprisingly, reviews of the area have been published at variable intervals. However, the earlier reviews have been summaries of published research rather than a critical analysis of it. They have focused upon the conclusions presented in the original research papers rather than on evaluating the reliability and functional significance of the data reported to support these conclusions. During the last few years, important new knowledge concerning dopaminergic systems and their behavioral functions as well as the possible role of these systems in sexual behavior has been obtained. For the first time, it is now possible to integrate the data obtained in studies of sexual behavior into the wider context of general dopaminergic functions. To make this possible, we first present an analysis of the nature and organization of sexual behavior followed by a summary of current knowledge about the brain structures of crucial importance for this behavior. We then proceed with a description of the dopaminergic systems within or projecting to these structures. Whenever possible, we also try to include data on the electrophysiological actions of dopamine. Thereafter, we proceed with analyses of pharmacological data and release studies, both in males and in females. Consistently throughout this discussion, we make an effort to distinguish pharmacological effects on sexual behavior from a possible physiological role of dopamine. By pharmacological effects, we mean here drug-induced alterations in behavior that are not the result of the normal actions of synaptically released dopamine in the untreated animal. The conclusion of this endeavor is that pharmacological effects of dopaminergic drugs are variable in both males and females, independently of whether the drugs are administered systemically or intracerebrally. We conclude that the pharmacological data basically reinforce the notion that dopamine is important for motor functions and general arousal. These actions could, in fact, explain most of the effects seen on sexual behavior. Studies of dopamine release, in both males and females, have focused on the nucleus accumbens, a structure with at most a marginal importance for sexual behavior. Since accumbens dopamine release is associated with all kinds of events, aversive as well as appetitive, it can have no specific effect on sexual behavior but promotes arousal and activation of non-specific motor patterns. Preoptic and paraventricular nucleus release of dopamine may have some relationship to mechanisms of ejaculation or to the neuroendocrine consequences of sexual activity or they can be related to other autonomic processes associated with copulation. There is no compelling indication in existing experimental data that dopamine is of any particular importance for sexual motivation. There is experimental evidence showing that it is of no importance for sexual reward.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. The etiology of PD is likely due to combinations of environmental and genetic factors. In addition to the loss of neurons, including dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, a further morphologic hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. The formation of these proteinaceous inclusions involves interaction of several proteins, including alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1, parkin and UCH-L1. Animal models allow to get insight into the mechanisms of several symptoms of PD, allow investigating new therapeutic strategies and, in addition, provide an indispensable tool for basic research. In animals PD does not arise spontaneously, thus, characteristic and specific functional changes have to be mimicked by application of neurotoxic agents or by genetic manipulations. In this review we will focus on genes and gene loci involved in PD, the functions of proteins involved in the formation of cytoplasmatic inclusions, their interactions, and their possible role in PD. In addition, we will review the current animal models of PD.","Glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the vertebrate retina, ""a genuine neural center"" (Ramón y Cajal, 1964, Recollections of My Life, C.E. Horne (Translater) MIT Press, Cambridge, MA). Photoreceptors, generating visual signals, and bipolar cells, mediating signal transfer from photoreceptors to ganglion cells, both release glutamate, which induces and/or changes the activity of the post-synaptic neurons (horizontal and bipolar cells for photoreceptors; amacrine and ganglion cells for bipolar cells). Horizontal and amacrine cells, which mediate lateral interaction in the outer and inner retina respectively, use GABA as a principal neurotransmitter. In recent years, glutamate receptors and GABA receptors in the retina have been extensively studied, using multi-disciplinary approaches. In this article some important advances in this field are reviewed, with special reference to retinal information processing. Photoreceptors possess metabotropic glutamate receptors and several subtypes of GABA receptors. Most horizontal cells express AMPA receptors, which may be predominantly assembled from flop slice variants. In addition, these cells also express GABAA and GABAC receptors. Signal transfer from photoreceptors to bipolar cells is rather complicated. Whereas AMPA/KA receptors mediate transmission for OFF type bipolar cells, several subtypes of glutamate receptors, both ionotropic and metabotropic, are involved in the generation of light responses of ON type bipolar cells. GABAA and GABAC receptors with distinct kinetics are differentially expressed on dendrites and axon terminals of both ON and OFF bipolar cells, mediating inhibition from horizontal cells and amacrine cells. Amacrine cells possess ionotropic glutamate receptors, whereas ganglion cells express both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. GABAA receptors exist in amacrine and ganglion cells. Physiological data further suggest that GABAC receptors may be involved in the activity of these neurons. Moreover, responses of these retinal third order neurons are modulated by GABAB receptors, and in ganglion cells there exist several subtypes of GABAB receptors. A variety of glutamate receptor and GABA receptor subtypes found in the retina perform distinct functions, thus providing a wide range of neural integration and versatility of synaptic transmission. Perspectives in this research field are presented.","One of the most obvious deficits following a spinal cord injury is the difficulty in walking, forcing many patients to use wheelchairs for locomotion. Over the past decade considerable effort has been directed at promoting the recovery of walking and to find effective treatments for spinal cord injury. Advances in our knowledge of the neuronal control of walking have led to the development of a promising rehabilitative strategy in patients with partial spinal cord injury, namely treadmill training with partial weight support. The current focus is on developing more efficient training protocols and automating the training to reduce the physical demand for the therapists. Mechanisms underlying training-induced improvements in walking have been revealed to some extent in animal studies. Another strategy for improving the walking in spinal cord injured patients is the use of functional electric stimulation of nerves and muscles to assist stepping movements. This field has advanced significantly over the past decade as a result of developments in computer technology and the miniaturization of electronics. Finally, basic research on animals with damaged spinal cords has focused on enhancing walking and other motor functions by promoting growth and regeneration of damaged axons. Numerous important findings have been reported yielding optimism that techniques for repairing the injured spinal cord will be developed in the near future. However, at present no strategy involving direct treatment of the injured spinal cord has been established for routine use in spinal cord injured patients. It now seems likely that any successful protocol in humans will require a combination of a treatment to promote re-establishing functional connections to neuronal networks in the spinal cord and specialized rehabilitation training to shape the motor patterns generated by these networks for specific behavioral tasks.","Olfactory systems serve as excellent model systems for the study of numerous widespread aspects of neural development and also for the elucidation of features peculiar to the formation of neural circuits specialized to process odor inputs. Accumulated research reveals a fine balance between developmental autonomy of olfactory structures and intercellular interactions essential for their normal development. Recent findings have uncovered evidence for more autonomy than previously realized, but simultaneously have begun to reveal the complex cellular and molecular underpinnings of key interactions among neurons and glial cells at several important steps in olfactory development. Striking similarities in the functional organization of olfactory systems across vertebrate and invertebrate species allow the advantages of different species to be used to address common issues. Our own work in the moth Manduca sexta has demonstrated reciprocal neuron-glia interactions that have key importance in two aspects of development, the sorting of olfactory receptor axons into fascicles targeted for specific glomeruli and the creation of glomeruli. Studies in vertebrate species suggest that similar neuron-glia interactions may underlie olfactory development, although here the roles have not been tested so directly. Similar cellular interactions also are likely to play roles in development of some other systems in which axons of intermixed neurons must sort according to target specificity and systems in which reiterated modules of synaptic neuropil develop.","This review intends to begin to build a bridge between our understanding of the effect of motor rehabilitation and brain plasticity on recovery after hemiparetic stroke. It discusses the impact of intensive post-stroke motor rehabilitation on motor recovery. This is followed by an overview of our current understanding, based on human brain mapping technologies, of brain plasticity underlying spontaneous recovery after hemiparetic stroke. These discussions lead to a descriptive review of human brain mapping studies that have begun to provide an understanding of the neural basis of rehabilitation-induced gains in motor function after stroke. Finally, it speculates on how a solid understanding of the neural underpinnings of spontaneous and rehabilitation-induced motor recovery will permit brain mapping technologies to be applied toward optimizing post-stroke motor rehabilitation.","This review focuses on the remodeling of brain circuitry associated with epilepsy, particularly in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA systems, including alterations in synaptic efficacy, growth of new connections, and loss of existing connections. From recent studies on the kindling and status epilepticus models, which have been used most extensively to investigate temporal lobe epilepsy, it is now clear that the brain reorganizes itself in response to excess neural activation, such as seizure activity. The contributing factors to this reorganization include activation of glutamate receptors, second messengers, immediate early genes, transcription factors, neurotrophic factors, axon guidance molecules, protein synthesis, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Some of the resulting changes may, in turn, contribute to the permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility. There is increasing evidence that neurogenesis and synaptogenesis can appear not only in the mossy fiber pathway in the hippocampus but also in other limbic structures. Neuronal loss, induced by prolonged seizure activity, may also contribute to circuit restructuring, particularly in the status epilepticus model. However, it is unlikely that any one structure, plastic system, neurotrophin, or downstream effector pathway is uniquely critical for epileptogenesis. The sensitivity of neural systems to the modulation of inhibition makes a disinhibition hypothesis compelling for both the triggering stage of the epileptic response and the long-term changes that promote the epileptic state. Loss of selective types of interneurons, alteration of GABA receptor configuration, and/or decrease in dendritic inhibition could contribute to the development of spontaneous seizures.","The mammalian CNS is composed of an extremely complex meshwork of highly ordered interconnections among billions of neurons. To understand the diverse functions of this neuronal network we need to differentiate between functionally related and nonrelated elements. A powerful labeling method for defining intricate neural circuits is based on the utilization of neurotropic herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus and herpes simplex virus type 1. The recent development of genetically engineered tracing viruses can open the way toward the conception of novel tract-tracing paradigms. These new-generation tracing viruses may facilitate the clarification of problems, which were inaccessible to earlier approaches. This article first presents a concise review of the general aspects of neuroanatomical tracing protocols. Subsequently, it discusses the molecular biology of alpha-herpesviruses, and the genetic manipulation and gene expression techniques that are utilized for the construction of virus-based tracers. Finally, it describes the current utilization of genetically modified herpesviruses for circuit analysis, and the future directions in their potential applications.","Membrane receptors for neuromodulators (NM) are highly regulated in their distribution and efficacy-a phenomenon which influences the individual cell's response to central signals of NM release. Even though NM receptor regulation is implicated in the pharmacological action of many drugs, and is also known to be influenced by various environmental factors, its functional consequences and modes of action are not well understood. In this paper we summarize relevant experimental evidence on NM receptor regulation (specifically dopamine D1 and D2 receptors) in order to explore its significance for neural and synaptic plasticity. We identify the relevant components of NM receptor regulation (receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking and sensitization of second-messenger pathways) gained from studies on cultured cells. Key principles in the regulation and control of short-term plasticity (sensitization) are identified, and a model is presented which employs direct and indirect feedback regulation of receptor efficacy. We also discuss long-term plasticity which involves shifts in receptor sensitivity and loss of responsivity to NM signals. Finally, we discuss the implications of NM receptor regulation for models of brain plasticity and memorization. We emphasize that a realistic model of brain plasticity will have to go beyond Hebbian models of long-term potentiation and depression. Plasticity in the distribution and efficacy of NM receptors may provide another important source of functional plasticity with implications for learning and memory.","In the adult brain, different neuronal populations display different degrees of plasticity. Here, we describe the highly different plastic properties of inferior olivary neurones and Purkinje cells. Olivary neurones show a basal expression of growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43 and Krox24/EGR-1, and remarkable remodelling capabilities of their terminal arbour. They also regenerate their transected neurites into growth-permissive territories and may reinnervate the lost target. Sprouting and regrowing olivary axons are able to follow specific positional information cues to establish new connections according to the original projection map. In addition, they set a strong cell body reaction to injury, which in specific olivary subsets is regulated by inhibitory target-derived cues. In contrast, Purkinje cells do not have a constitutive level of growth-associated genes, and show little cell body reaction, no axonal regeneration after axotomy, and weak sprouting capabilities. Block of myelin-derived signals allows terminal arbour remodelling, but not regeneration, while selective over-expression of GAP-43 induces axonal sprouting along the axonal surface and at the level of the lesion. We suggest that the high constitutive intrinsic plasticity of the inferior olive neurones allows their terminal arbour to sustain the activity-dependent ongoing competition with the parallel fibres in order to maintain the post-synaptic territory, and possibly underlies mechanisms of learning and memory. Such a plasticity is used also as a reparative mechanism following axotomy. In contrast, in Purkinje cells, poor intrinsic regenerative capabilities and myelin-derived signals stabilise the mature connectivity and prevent axonal regeneration after lesion.","The human orbitofrontal cortex is an important brain region for the processing of rewards and punishments, which is a prerequisite for the complex and flexible emotional and social behaviour which contributes to the evolutionary success of humans. Yet much remains to be discovered about the functions of this key brain region, and new evidence from functional neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychology is affording new insights into the different functions of the human orbitofrontal cortex. We review the neuroanatomical and neuropsychological literature on the human orbitofrontal cortex, and propose two distinct trends of neural activity based on a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. One is a mediolateral distinction, whereby medial orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to monitoring the reward value of many different reinforcers, whereas lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to the evaluation of punishers which may lead to a change in ongoing behaviour. The second is a posterior-anterior distinction with more complex or abstract reinforcers (such as monetary gain and loss) represented more anteriorly in the orbitofrontal cortex than simpler reinforcers such as taste or pain. Finally, we propose new neuroimaging methods for obtaining further evidence on the localisation of function in the human orbitofrontal cortex.","Recent advances in molecular biology have drastically changed our vision on the development of the nervous system, the cerebellum in particular. After a classical descriptive period, we are now in a modern mechanistic epoch as we begin to answer crucial questions in our quest to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain complexity. This review begins with an analysis of the role of the ""isthmic organizer"" in the induction and specification of the cerebellar territory and progresses through cerebellar development to the formation of cerebellar maps. It gathers information about the control of the proliferation of granule cell precursors by Purkinje cells and the role of Shh/Gli-patched signaling. The migratory routes for cerebellar and precerebellar neurons, together with the long-range and short-range cues guiding gliophilic and, particularly, neurophilic migrations, are also discussed. Because these cues are similar to those involved in axon guidance, both processes are under the same molecular constraints. Finally, using primarily the olivocerebellar projection as a model, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of cerebellar maps are discussed. During embryonic development, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and neurons in the inferior olive follow a simultaneous, but independent, process of intrinsic parcellation, giving rise to subsets of biochemically different cortical compartments. The occurrence of positional information shared between olivary axons and their postsynaptic targets, the Purkinje cells, provides a molecular code for the formation of coarse-grained maps. Activity-dependent mechanisms are required for the transition from crude to fine-grained maps. This important refinement, which confers ultimate specificity to the maps, is under the regulation of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic activity.","The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been known to regulate several classic physiologies including blood pressure, sodium and water balance, cyclicity of reproductive hormones and sexual behaviors, and pituitary gland hormones. These physiologies are thought to be under the control of the angiotensin II (AngII)/AT1 receptor subtype system. The AT2 receptor subtype is expressed during fetal development and is less abundant in the adult. This receptor appears to oppose growth responses facilitated by the AT1 receptor, as well as growth factor receptors. Recent evidence points to an important contribution by the brain RAS to non-classic physiologies mediated by the newly discovered angiotensin IV (AngIV)/AT4 receptor subtype system. These physiologies include the regulation of blood flow, modulation of exploratory behavior, and a facilitory role in learning and memory acquisition. This system appears to interact with brain matrix metalloproteinases in order to modify extracellular matrix molecules thus permitting the synaptic remodeling critical to the neural plasticity presumed to underlie memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and retrieval. There is support for an inhibitory influence by AngII activation of the AT1 subtype, and a facilitory role by AngIV activation of the AT4 subtype, on neuronal firing rate, long-term potentiation, associative and spatial learning. The discovery of the AT4 receptor subtype, and its facilitory influence upon learning and memory, suggest an important role for the brain RAS in normal cognitive processing and perhaps in the treatment of dysfunctional memory disease states.","This review addresses cerebral metabolic and neurohumoral alterations during prolonged exercise in humans with special focus on associations with fatigue. Global energy turnover in the brain is unaltered by the transition from rest to moderately intense exercise, apparently because exercise-induced activation of some brain regions including cortical motor areas is compensated for by reduced activity in other regions of the brain. However, strenuous exercise is associated with cerebral metabolic and neurohumoral alterations that may relate to central fatigue. Fatigue should be acknowledged as a complex phenomenon influenced by both peripheral and central factors. However, failure to drive the motorneurons adequately as a consequence of neurophysiological alterations seems to play a dominant role under some circumstances. During exercise with hyperthermia excessive accumulation of heat in the brain due to impeded heat removal by the cerebral circulation may elevate the brain temperature to >40 degrees C and impair the ability to sustain maximal motor activation. Also, when prolonged exercise results in hypoglycaemia, perceived exertion increases at the same time as the cerebral glucose uptake becomes low, and centrally mediated fatigue appears to arise as the cerebral energy turnover becomes restricted by the availability of substrates for the brain. Changes in serotonergic activity, inhibitory feed-back from the exercising muscles, elevated ammonia levels, and alterations in regional dopaminergic activity may also contribute to the impaired voluntary activation of the motorneurons after prolonged and strenuous exercise. Furthermore, central fatigue may involve depletion of cerebral glycogen stores, as signified by the observation that following exhaustive exercise the cerebral glucose uptake increases out of proportion to that of oxygen. In summary, prolonged exercise may induce homeostatic disturbances within the central nervous system (CNS) that subsequently attenuates motor activation. Therefore, strenuous exercise is a challenge not only to the cardiorespiratory and locomotive systems but also to the brain.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive intrusive thoughts and compulsive time-consuming behaviors classified into three to five distinct symptom dimensions including: (1) aggressive/somatic obsessions with checking compulsions; (2) contamination concerns with washing compulsions; (3) symmetry obsessions with counting/ordering compulsions; (4) hoarding obsessions with collecting compulsions; and (5) sexual/religious concerns. Phenomenologically, OCD could be thought of as the irruption of internal signals centered on the erroneous perception that ""something is wrong"" in a specific situation. This generates severe anxiety, leading to recurrent behaviors aimed at reducing the emotional tension. In this paper, we examine how the abnormalities in brain activity reported in OCD can be interpreted in the light of physiology after consideration of various approaches (phenomenology, neuropsychology, neuroimmunology and neuroimagery) that contribute to proposing the central role of several cortical and subcortical regions, especially the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), the head of the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. The OFC is involved in the significance attributed to the consequences of action, thereby subserving decision-making, whereas the ACC is particularly activated in situations in which there are conflicting options and a high likelihood of making an error. The DLPC plays a critical part in the cognitive processing of relevant information. This cortical information is then integrated by the caudate nucleus, which controls behavioral programs. A dysfunction of these networks at one or several stages will result in the emergence and maintenance of repetitive thoughts and characteristic OCD behavior.","Differentiating neurons must acquire many unique morphological and functional characteristics in creating the precise neural circuits of the mature nervous system. The phenomenon of 'neuronal differentiation' includes a special set of simple, separate processes, that is, neuritogenesis, neurite outgrowth, pathfinding, targeting and synaptogenesis. All of these processes are critically dependent on the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton by many actin-binding proteins that function downstream of Rho-family GTPases. Furthermore, de novo synthesis of key proteins are critically involved in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton during neuronal differentiation. In this article, we review recent progresses in the general mechanisms that control actin dynamics by various actin-binding proteins in differentiating neurons, including a series of recent studies from our laboratory on de novo synthesis of several key proteins that are essential for actin reorganization induced by second messengers. We demonstrated that dual regulation of cyclic AMP and Ca2+ determines cofilin (an actin-binding protein) phosphorylation states and LIM kinase 1 (a cofilin kinase) expression level during neuritogenesis.","In the 1960s, it was shown for the first time that enriched housing enhances functional recovery after brain damage. During the 1970s and 1980s, many findings similar to this initial one have been reported, enlarging greatly its generality. Over the last 13 years, many different kinds of brain damage were modelled in animals or even directly studied in humans. Overall, these recent studies corroborated earlier findings, although occasional exceptions were reported. Other critical data, obtained mainly in intact animals, showed that enriched housing increases neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Recent evidence that this neurogenesis is involved in hippocampal-dependent learning supports the original interpretation of the enrichment effects as being the result of an accumulation of informal learning experiences (e.g., [. Heredity, environment, brain biochemistry, and learning. In: Current Trends in Psychological Theory. University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, pp. 87-110;. Brain changes in response to experience. Sci. Am. 226, 22-29]). Other components of enriched environment, such as physical exercise, may have additive effects with those of training. The comparison of the relative effectiveness of enriched experience, of physical exercise and of training on structural and/or functional assessments of recovery, shows that training/learning is generally more effective than physical exercise and that enriched experience is a more potent therapy than either of these two other treatments. The combination of enriched experience with some other neurosurgical and/or neuropharmacological treatments may further improve its therapeutic effectiveness. Finally, other recent reports emphasize that the treatment parameters may be changed in order to approximate clinical/rehabilitation conditions and, nevertheless, remain effective.","Intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) of the enteric nervous system are quite different from all other peripheral neurons. The IPANs are transducers of physiological stimuli, including movement of the villi or distortion of the mucosa, contraction of intestinal muscle and changes in the chemistry of the contents of the gut lumen. They are the first neurons in intrinsic reflexes that influence the patterns of motility, secretion of fluid across the mucosal epithelium and local blood flow in the small and large intestines. In the guinea pig small intestine, where they have been characterized in detail, IPANs have Dogiel type II morphology, that is they are large round or oval neurons with multiple processes, some of which end close to the luminal surface of the intestine, and some of which form synapses with enteric interneurons, motor neurons and with other IPANs. The IPANs have well-defined ionic currents through which their excitability, and their functions in enteric nerve circuits, is determined. These include voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents, a long lasting calcium-activated K(+) current, and a hyperpolarization-activated cationic current. The IPANs exhibit long-term changes in their states of excitation that can be induced by extended periods of low frequency activity in synaptic inputs and by inflammatory mediators, either applied directly or released during an inflammatory challenge. The IPANs may be involved in pathological changes in enteric function following inflammation.","The cellular and the inter-connective complexity of the central nervous system (CNS) necessitate's analysis of functioning at both the system and single cell levels. Systems neuroscience has developed procedures that facilitate the analysis of multicellular systems including multielectrode arrays, dye tracings and lesioning assays, and at the single cell level there have been significant strides in assessing the physiology and morphology of individual cells. Until recently little progress had been made in understanding the molecular biology of single neuronal cells. This review will highlight the development of PCR and aRNA procedures for analysis of mRNA abundances in single cells. Also, other procedures for the analysis of protein abundances as well as the association of RNA with proteins will also be summarized. These procedures promise to provide experimental insights that will help unravel the functional mechanisms regulating the cellular components of the CNS.","Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell types in the brain, provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons and modulate synaptic activity. Accordingly, impairment in these astrocyte functions can critically influence neuronal survival. Recent studies show that astrocyte apoptosis may contribute to pathogenesis of many acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We found that incubation of cultured rat astrocytes in a Ca(2+)-containing medium after exposure to a Ca(2+)-free medium causes an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration followed by apoptosis, and that NF-kappa B, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes such as calpain, xanthine oxidase, calcineurin and caspase-3 are involved in reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that heat shock protein, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase are target molecules for anti-apoptotic drugs. This review summarizes (1) astrocytic functions in neuroprotection, (2) current evidence of astrocyte apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies including its molecular pathways such as Ca(2+) overload, oxidative stress, NF-kappa B activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protease activation, and (3) several drugs preventing astrocyte apoptosis. As a whole, this article provides new insights into the potential role of astrocytes as targets for neuroprotection. In addition, the advance in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of astrocyte apoptosis may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.","Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, in which there is progressive motor and cognitive deterioration, and for which the pathogenesis of neuronal death remains controversial. Mitochondrial toxins like 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and malonate, functioning as the inhibitors of the complex II of mitochondrial respiratory chain, have been found to effectively induce specific behavioral changes and selective striatal lesions in rats and non-human primates mimicking those in HD. Furthermore, several kinds of transgenic mouse models of HD have been recently developed, and used in the development and assessment of novel treatments for HD. In the past, most studies evaluating the animal models for HD were based on histological changes or in vitro neuronal cultures. With the emergence of advanced magnetic resonance technologies, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy provide more detail of cerebral alterations, including the changes of cerebral structure, function and metabolites. These studies support the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction with increased excitation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors can replicate the neurobehavioral changes, selective brain injury and neurochemical alterations in HD. The present review focuses on our work as well as that of others regarding 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity and other animal models of HD. Using both conventional and advanced MRI and spectroscopy, we summarize the pathogenesis and possible therapeutic strategies in chemical and transgenic models of HD. The results show magnetic resonance techniques to be powerful techniques in the evaluation of pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention for both chemical and transgenic models of HD.","CNS drugs may act by modifying the emergent properties of complex CNS neuronal networks. Emergent properties are network characteristics that are not predictably based on properties of individual member neurons. Neuronal membership within networks is controlled by several mechanisms, including burst firing, gap junctions, endogenous and exogenous neuroactive substances, extracellular ions, temperature, interneuron activity, astrocytic integration and external stimuli. The effects of many CNS drugs in vivo may critically involve actions on specific brain loci, but this selectivity may be absent when the same neurons are isolated from the network in vitro where emergent properties are lost. Audiogenic seizures (AGS) qualify as an emergent CNS property, since in AGS the acoustic stimulus evokes a non-linear output (motor convulsion), but the identical stimulus evokes minimal behavioral changes normally. The hierarchical neuronal network, subserving AGS in rodents is initiated in inferior colliculus (IC) and progresses to deep layers of superior colliculus (DLSC), pontine reticular formation (PRF) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) in genetic and ethanol withdrawal-induced AGS. In blocking AGS, certain anticonvulsants reduce IC neuronal firing, while other agents act primarily on neurons in other AGS network sites. However, the NMDA receptor channel blocker, MK-801, does not depress neuronal firing in any network site despite potently blocking AGS. Recent findings indicate that MK-801 actually enhances firing in substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) neurons in vivo but not in vitro. Thus, the MK-801-induced firing increases in SNR neurons observed in vivo may involve an indirect effect via disinhibition, involving an action on the emergent properties of this seizure network.","Saccadic eye movements are shifts in the direction of gaze that rapidly and accurately aim the fovea at targets of interest. Saccades are so brief that visual feedback cannot guide them to their targets. Therefore, the saccadic motor command must be accurately specified in advance of the movement and continually modified to compensate for growth, injury, and aging, which otherwise would produce dysmetric saccades. When a persistent dysmetria occurs in subjects with muscle weakness or neural damage or is induced in normal primates by the surreptitious jumping of a target forward or backward as a saccade is made to acquire the target, saccadic amplitude changes to reduce the dysmetria. Adaptation of saccadic amplitude or direction occurs gradually and is retained in the dark, thus representing true motor plasticity. Saccadic adaptation is more rapid in humans than in monkeys, usually is incomplete in both species, and is slower and less robust for amplitude increases than decreases. Adaptation appears to be motor rather than sensory. In humans, adaptation of saccades that would seem to require more sensory-motor processing does not transfer to saccades that seem to require less, suggesting the existence of distributed adaptation loci. In monkeys, however, transfer from more simple to more complex saccades is robust, suggesting a common adaptation site. Neurophysiological data from both species indicate that the oculomotor cerebellum is crucial for saccadic adaptation. This review shows that the precise, voluntary behaviors known as saccadic eye movements provide an alternative to simple reflexes for the study of the neuronal basis of motor learning.","Apoptosis of neurons is indispensable to the normal development of the nervous system and contributes to neuronal loss in neurologic injury and disease. Life and death decisions are imposed upon neurons by extracellular and intracellular stimuli including the lack of trophic support, exposure to neurotoxins, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. These stimuli induce signaling pathways that are integrated at the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery culminating in cell survival or death. Growing evidence suggests that cell cycle proteins are expressed in dying neurons in the developing and adult brain. However, the role and mechanisms by which re-activation of cell cycle pathways in postmitotic neurons propagates an apoptotic signal to the cell death machinery are just beginning to be characterized. Here, we will review the molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell death and survival with a focus on recent findings on cell cycle regulation of neuronal apoptosis in primary cultures of neurons, mouse models of neuronal diseases, and human neurodegenerative diseases.","Modeling of the basal ganglia has played a major role in our understanding of this elusive group of nuclei. Models of the basal ganglia have undergone evolutionary and revolutionary changes over the last 20 years, as new research in the fields of anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of these nuclei has yielded new information. Early models dealt with a single pathway through the nuclei and focused on the nature of the processing performed within it, convergence of information versus parallel processing of information. Later, the Albin-DeLong ""box-and-arrow"" model characterized the inter-nuclei interaction as multiple pathways while maintaining a simplistic scalar representation of the nuclei themselves. This model made a breakthrough by providing key insights into the behavior of these nuclei in hypo- and hyper-kinetic movement disorders. The next generation of models elaborated the intra-nuclei interactions and focused on the role of the basal ganglia in action selection and sequence generation which form the most current consensus regarding basal ganglia function in both normal and pathological conditions. However, new findings challenge these models and point to a different neural network approach to information processing in the basal ganglia. Here, we take an in-depth look at the reinforcement driven dimensionality reduction (RDDR) model which postulates that the basal ganglia compress cortical information according to a reinforcement signal using optimal extraction methods. The model provides new insights and experimental predictions on the computational capacity of the basal ganglia and their role in health and disease.","Protein kinases critically regulate synaptic plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus. Cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine-threonine kinase that has been strongly implicated in the expression of specific forms of long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and hippocampal long-term memory. We review the roles of PKA in activity-dependent forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by highlighting particular themes that have emerged in ongoing research. These include the participation of distinct isoforms of PKA in specific types of synaptic plasticity, modification of the PKA-dependence of LTP by multiple factors such as distinct patterns of imposed activity, environmental enrichment, and genetic manipulation of signalling molecules, and presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms for PKA-dependent LTP. We also discuss many of the substrates that have been implicated as targets for PKA's actions in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, including CREB, protein phosphatases, and glutamatergic receptors. Future prospects for shedding light on the roles of PKA are also described from the perspective of specific aspects of synaptic physiology and brain function that are ripe for investigation using incisive genetic, cell biological, and electrophysiological approaches.","Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder related to the systemic deposition of mutated transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils, particularly in peripheral nervous system (PNS). TTR fibrils are diffusely distributed in the PNS of FAP patients, involving nerve trunks, plexuses and ganglia. In peripheral nerves, amyloid deposits are prominent in the endoneurium, near blood vessels, Schwann cells and collagen fibrils. Fiber degeneration is axonal, beginning in the unmyelinated and low diameter myelinated fibers. Several hypotheses have been raised to explain axonal and neuronal loss: (i) compression of the nervous tissue by amyloid; however, a cause-effect relationship between amyloid deposition, structural nerve changes and degeneration was never clearly made; (ii) role of nerve ischemia secondary to lesions caused by perivascular amyloid, which is also doubtful as compromised blood flow was never demonstrated; (iii) lesions in the dorsal root ganglia neurons or Schwann cells. Recently, evidence for the presence of toxic non-fibrillar TTR aggregates early in FAP nerves constituted a first step to unravel molecular signaling related to neurodegeneration in FAP. The toxic nature of TTR non-fibrillar aggregates, and not mature TTR fibrils, was evidenced by their ability to induce the expression of oxidative stress and inflammation-related molecules in neuronal cells, driving them into apoptotic pathways. How these TTR aggregates exert their effects is debatable; interaction with cellular receptors, namely, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), is a probable candidate mechanism. The pathology and the yet unknown molecular signaling mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration in FAP are discussed.","Until about 10 years ago, knowledge of the functional organisation of the central pathways that subserve cardiovascular responses to homeostatic challenges and other stressors was based almost entirely on studies in anaesthetised animals. More recently, however, many studies have used the method of the expression of immediate early genes, particularly the c-fos gene, to identify populations of central neurons that are activated by such challenges in conscious animals. In this review we first consider the advantages and limitations of this method. Then, we discuss how the application of the method of immediate early gene expression, when used alone or in combination with other methods, has contributed to our understanding of the central mechanisms that regulate the autonomic and neuroendocrine response to various cardiovascular challenges (e.g., hypotension, hypoxia, hypovolemia, and other stressors) as they operate in the conscious state. In general, the results of studies of central cardiovascular pathways using immediate early gene expression are consistent with previous studies in anaesthetised animals, but in addition have revealed other previously unrecognised pathways that also contribute to cardiovascular regulation. Finally, we briefly consider recent evidence indicating that immediate early gene expression can modify the functional properties of central cardiovascular neurons, and the possible significance of this in producing long-term changes in the regulation of the cardiovascular system both in normal and pathological conditions.","The granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), origin of the mossy fibers (MFs), have been considered to be glutamatergic. However, data obtained with different experimental approaches in recent years may be calling for a redefinition of their phenotype. Although they indeed release glutamate for fast neurotransmission, immunohistological and molecular biology evidence has revealed that these glutamatergic cells also express GABAergic markers. The granule cell expression of a GABAergic phenotype is developmentally regulated. Electrophysiological studies reveal that during the first 3 weeks of age, mossy fiber stimulation provokes monosynaptic fast inhibitory transmission mediated by GABA, besides the monosynaptic excitatory glutamatergic transmission, onto their targets in CA3. After this age, mossy fiber GABAergic transmission abruptly disappears and the GABAergic markers are undetected. In the adult, the GABAergic markers are upregulated and GABA-mediated transmission emerges after induction of hyperexcitability. The simultaneous glutamate- and GABA-mediated signals share the same plastic and pharmacological characteristics that correspond to neurotransmission of mossy fiber origin. This intriguing evidence gives rise to two fundamental points of discussion. The first is the plausible fact that glutamate and GABA, two neurotransmitters of opposing actions, are coreleased from the mossy fibers. The second relates to its functional implications that can be immediately inferred, as the dentate gyrus can exert direct GABA-mediated excitatory actions early in life and inhibitory actions in young and adult hippocampus. This evidence poses the need to reevaluate and reinterpret some aspects of the physiology of the mossy fiber pathway under normal and pathological conditions. This work reviews the recent evidence that supports the assumption that glutamate and GABA can be coreleased from a single pathway, the mossy fibers, and makes some considerations about its functional implications.","An engineering control approach is developed for the movement of attention, based on several features: experimental data indicating separate sites for attention modulation and for the creation of that modulation; the resulting analogy with motor control, to which an engineering approach has been applied; simulation and qualitative results supporting the presence of several of the necessary modules. These features are reviewed in the paper and a control model developed for the movement of attention. The engineering control framework is extended to the attended learning of motor control, again with description of support arising from simulations and qualitative analysis of several paradigms. The framework is even further extended to analyze how consciousness could arise during attentive processing, using the COrollary Discharge of Attention Movement (CODAM) model. This model is extended to encompass the temporal development of activity in various brain sites. Particular signals of the CODAM model are described and related to paradigms such as the attentional blink (AB) and features of simultaneous experience in neglect. A program of future explorations of the CODAM model and a set of open questions conclude the paper.","In vertebrate motor nerve terminals and in the electromotor nerve terminals of Torpedo there are two major pools of synaptic vesicles: readily releasable and reserve. The electromotor terminals differ in that the reserve vesicles are twice the diameter of the readily releasable vesicles. The vesicles contain high concentrations of ACh and ATP. Part of the ACh is brought into the vesicle by the vesicular ACh transporter, VAChT, which exchanges two protons for each ACh, but a fraction of the ACh seems to be accumulated by different, unexplored mechanisms. Most of the vesicles in the terminals do not exchange ACh or ATP with the axoplasm, although ACh and ATP are free in the vesicle interior. The VAChT is controlled by a multifaceted regulatory complex, which includes the proteoglycans that characterize the cholinergic vesicles. The drug (-)-vesamicol binds to a site on the complex and blocks ACh exchange. Only 10-20% of the vesicles are in the readily releasable pool, which therefore is turned over fairly rapidly by spontaneous quantal release. The turnover can be followed by the incorporation of false transmitters into the recycling vesicles, and by the rate of uptake of FM dyes, which have some selectivity for the two recycling pathways. The amount of ACh loaded into recycling vesicles in the readily releasable pool decreases during stimulation. The ACh content of the vesicles can be varied over eight-fold range without changing vesicle size.","In the developing nervous system, extending axons are directed towards their appropriate targets by a myriad of attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Work in the past decade has significantly advanced our understanding of these molecules and has made it increasingly clear that their function is not limited to the guidance of growing axons during embryogenesis. Axon guidance cues fulfill additional roles in angiogenesis, cell migration and the immune system, and often display sustained expression in adulthood. Here we focus on the semaphorin (Sema) family and review their proposed functions in the adult nervous system. Several semaphorin family members continue to be expressed in the adult brain and spinal cord, and increasing evidence indicates that their expression is regulated upon nervous system injury in rodents and in neuropathology in humans. The available evidence suggests that semaphorins might significantly contribute to the maintenance and stability of neuronal networks. Furthermore, semaphorins could play important roles in the regeneration, or failure thereof, of neuronal connections. In the future, genetic manipulation of semaphorins and their receptors in the adult intact and injured nervous system should provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms by which semaphorin signaling contributes to structural plasticity and regeneration in the adult brain.","Mental actions are based on the dynamic organization of neuronal networks. In particular, phylogenetically young brain areas (e.g., cortical associative circuits) involved in the realization of higher brain functions are continuously re-adjusted to meet environmental demands. The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, i.e., of structural stabilization and labilization underlying a life-long synaptic remodelling, are largely based on external morphoregulatory cues and internal signalling pathways that non-neuronal cells have phylogenetically acquired to sense their relationship to the local neighbourhood and to control after development is completed proliferation and differentiation in the process of tissue repair and regeneration. After having withdrawn from the cell cycle, differentiated neurons are, thus, able to use molecular mechanisms primarily developed to control proliferation alternatively to control synaptic plasticity. The existence of these alternative effector pathways within a neuron puts it at risk to erroneously convert signals derived from plastic synaptic changes into positional cues that will activate the cell cycle. This cell cycle activation potentially links synaptic plasticity to cell death. Preventing cell cycle activation by locking neurons in a differentiated but still highly plastic phenotype will, thus, be crucial to prevent neurodegeneration.","Certain metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone are established as potent and selective positive allosteric modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor. Upon administration these steroids exhibit clear behavioural effects that include anxiolysis, sedation and analgesia, they are anticonvulsant and at high doses induce a state of general anaesthesia, a profile consistent with an action to enhance neuronal inhibition. Physiologically, peripherally synthesised pregnane steroids derived from endocrine glands such as the adrenals and ovaries function as hormones by crossing the blood brain barrier to influence neuronal signalling. However, the demonstration that certain neurons and glial cells within the central nervous system (CNS) can synthesize these steroids either de novo, or from peripherally derived progesterone, has led to the proposal that these steroids (neurosteroids) can additionally function in a paracrine manner, to locally influence GABAergic transmission. Steroid levels are known to change dynamically, for example in stress and during pregnancy. Given that GABA(A) receptors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the central nervous system, such changes in steroid levels would be predicted to cause a global enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission throughout the brain, a scenario that would seem incompatible with a physiological role as a selective neuromodulator. Here, we will review emerging evidence that the GABA-modulatory actions of the pregnane steroids are highly selective, with their actions being brain region and indeed neuron dependent. Furthermore, the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors is not static but can dynamically change. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this neuronal specificity will be discussed with particular emphasis being given to the role of GABA(A) receptor isoforms, protein phosphorylation and local steroid metabolism and synthesis.","The process of aging deeply influences morphological and functional parameters of peripheral nerves. The observations summarized here indicate that the deterioration of myelin occurring in the peripheral nerves during aging may be explained by the fall of the levels of the major peripheral myelin proteins [e.g., glycoprotein Po (Po) and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22)]. Neuroactive steroids, such as progesterone (PROG), dihydroprogesterone (5alpha-DH PROG), and tetrahydroprogesterone (3alpha,5alpha-TH PROG), are able to stimulate the low expression of these two myelin proteins present in the sciatic nerve of aged male rats. Since Po and PMP22 play an important physiological role in the maintenance of the multilamellar structure of PNS myelin, we have evaluated the effect of PROG and its neuroactive derivatives, 5alpha-DH PROG and 3alpha,5alpha-TH PROG, on the morphological alterations of myelinated fibers in the sciatic nerve of 22-24-month-old male rats. Data obtained clearly indicate that neuroactive steroids are able to reduce aging-associated morphological abnormalities of myelin and aging-associated myelin fiber loss in the sciatic nerve.","The myelin sheaths that surround all but the smallest diameter axons within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) must maintain their structural integrity for many years. Like many tissues, however, this function is prone to the effects of ageing, and various structural anomalies become apparent in the aged CNS. Similarly, the regenerative process by which myelin sheaths, lost as a consequence of exposure to a demyelinating insult, are restored (remyelination) is also affected by age. As animals grow older, the efficiency of remyelination progressively declines. In this article, we review both phenomena and describe how both can be partially reversed by steroid hormones and their derivatives.","In humans and animals, individual differences in aging of cognitive functions are classically reported. Some old individuals exhibit performances similar to those of young subjects while others are severely impaired. In senescent animals, we have previously demonstrated a significant correlation between the cognitive performance and the cerebral concentration of a neurosteroid, the pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S). Neurotransmitter systems modulated by this neurosteroid were unknown until our recent report of an enhancement of acetylcholine (ACh) release in basolateral amygdala, cortex and hippocampus induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intracerebral administrations of PREG-S. Central ACh neurotransmission is known to be involved in the regulation of memory processes and is affected in normal aging and severely altered in human neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer's disease. In the central nervous system, ACh neurotransmission is also involved in the modulation of sleep-wakefulness cycle, and particularly the paradoxical sleep (PS). Relationships between paradoxical sleep and memory are documented in the literature in old animals in which the spatial memory performance positively correlates with the basal amounts of paradoxical sleep. PREG-S infused at the level of ACh cell bodies (nucleus basalis magnocellularis, NBM, or pedunculopontine nucleus, PPT) increases paradoxical sleep in young animals.Finally, aging related cognitive dysfunctions, particularly those observed in Alzheimer's disease, have also been related to alterations of mechanisms underlying cerebral plasticity. Amongst these mechanisms, neurogenesis has been extensively studied recently. Our data demonstrate that PREG-S central infusions dramatically increase neurogenesis, this effect could be related to the negative modulator properties of this steroid at the GABA(A) receptor level. Taken together these data suggest that neurosteroids can influence cognitive processes, particularly in senescent subjects, through a modulation of ACh neurotransmission associated with paradoxical sleep modifications; furthermore, our recent data suggest a critical role for neurosteroids in the modulation of cerebral plasticity, mainly on hippocampal neurogenesis.","Estradiol, in addition to its participation in neuroendocrine regulation and sexual behavior, has neuroprotective properties. Different types of brain injury induce the expression of the enzyme aromatase in reactive astroglia. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of testosterone and other C19 steroids to estradiol. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of brain aromatase results in marked neurodegeneration after different forms of mild neurodegenerative stimuli that do not compromise neuronal survival under control conditions. Furthermore, aromatase mediates neuroprotective effects of precursors of estradiol such as pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone. These findings strongly suggest that local formation of estradiol in the brain is neuroprotective and that the induction of aromatase and the consecutive increase in the local production of estradiol are part of the program triggered by the neural tissue to cope with neurodegenerative insults. Aromatase may thus represent an important pharmacological target for therapies conducted to prevent aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders.","Without medical progress, dementing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease will become one of the main causes of disability. Preventing or delaying them has thus become a real challenge for biomedical research. Steroids offer interesting therapeutical opportunities for promoting successful aging because of their pleiotropic effects in the nervous system: they regulate main neurotransmitter systems, promote the viability of neurons, play an important role in myelination and influence cognitive processes, in particular learning and memory. Preclinical research has provided evidence that the normally aging nervous system maintains some capacity for regeneration and that age-dependent changes in the nervous system and cognitive dysfunctions can be reversed to some extent by the administration of steroids. The aging nervous system also remains sensitive to the neuroprotective effects of steroids. In contrast to the large number of studies documenting beneficial effects of steroids on the nervous system in young and aged animals, the results from hormone replacement studies in the elderly are so far not conclusive. There is also little information concerning changes of steroid levels in the aging human brain. As steroids present in nervous tissues originate from the endocrine glands (steroid hormones) and from local synthesis (neurosteroids), changes in blood levels of steroids with age do not necessarily reflect changes in their brain levels. There is indeed strong evidence that neurosteroids are also synthesized in human brain and peripheral nerves. The development of a very sensitive and precise method for the analysis of steroids by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) offers new possibilities for the study of neurosteroids. The concentrations of a range of neurosteroids have recently been measured in various brain regions of aged Alzheimer's disease patients and aged non-demented controls by GC/MS, providing reference values. In Alzheimer's patients, there was a general trend toward lower levels of neurosteroids in different brain regions, and neurosteroid levels were negatively correlated with two biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, the phosphorylated tau protein and the beta-amyloid peptides. The metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone has also been analyzed for the first time in the aging brain from Alzheimer patients and non-demented controls. The conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to Delta5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol and to 7alpha-OH-dehydroepiandrosterone occurred in frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and striatum of both Alzheimer's patients and controls. The formation of these metabolites within distinct brain regions negatively correlated with the density of beta-amyloid deposits.","The object of this review is to assemble much of the literature concerning Purkinje cell death in cerebellar pathology and to relate this to what is now known about the complex topography of the cerebellar cortex. A brief introduction to Purkinje cells, and their regionalization is provided, and then the data on Purkinje cell death in mouse models and, where appropriate, their human counterparts, have been arranged according to several broad categories--naturally-occurring and targeted mutations leading to Purkinje cell death, Purkinje cell death due to toxins, Purkinje cell death in ischemia, Purkinje cell death in infection and in inherited disorders, etc. The data reveal that cerebellar Purkinje cell death is much more topographically complex than is usually appreciated.","The spectrum of inflammatory diseases is nowadays considered to include diverse diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Current evidence suggests that syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) have important inflammatory and immune components and may be amenable to treatment by anti-inflammatory and immunotherapeutic approaches. Compelling evidence has been reported that complement activation occurs in the brain with Alzheimer's disease, and that this contributes to the development of a local inflammatory state that is correlated with cognitive dysfunction. The complement system is a critical element of the innate immune system recognizing and killing, or targeting for destruction, otherwise pathogenic organisms. In addition to triggering the generation of a membranolytic complex, complement proteins interact with cell surface receptors to promote a local inflammatory response that contributes to the protection and healing of the host. Complement activation causes inflammation and cell damage, yet it is an essential component in trying to eliminate cell debris and potentially toxic protein aggregates. It is the balance of these seemingly competing events--the ""Yin"" and the ""Yang""--that influences the ultimate state of neuronal function. Knowledge of the unique molecular interactions that occur in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the functional consequences of those interactions, and the proportional contribution of each element to this disorder, should facilitate the design of effective therapeutic strategies for this disease.","Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a naturally occurring neurotrophic factor that plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and differentiation during normal brain development and maturation. The present review examines recent evidence that endogenous IGF-1 also plays a significant role in recovery from insults such as hypoxia-ischemia and that giving additional exogenous IGF-1 can actively ameliorate damage. It is now well established that neurons and other cell types die many hours or even days after initial injury due to activation of programmed cell death pathways. IGF-1 and its binding proteins and receptors are intensely induced within damaged brain regions following brain injury, suggesting a possible a role for IGF-1 in brain recovery. Exogenous administration of IGF-1 within a few hours after brain injury is now known to be protective in both gray and white matter and leads to improved somatic function. In contrast, pre-treatment is ineffective, likely reflecting limited intracerebral penetration of IGF-1 into the uninjured brain. The neuroprotective effects of IGF-1 are mediated by IGF-1 receptors and its binding proteins and are specific to particular cellular phenotypes and brain regions. The window of opportunity for treatment with IGF-1 is limited to a few hours after normothermic brain injury, reflecting its specific actions on early, intracellular events in the apoptotic cascade. However, injury-associated mild post-hypoxic hypothermia, which delays the development of cell death, can shift and dramatically extend the window of opportunity for delayed treatment with IGF-1. Such a combined approach is likely to be essential for any clinical treatment.","Steroid hormones act via evolutionarily conserved nuclear receptors to regulate neuronal phenotype during development, maturity and disease. Steroid hormones exert 'global' effects in organisms to produce coordinated physiological responses whereas, at the 'local' level, individual neurons can respond to a steroidal signal in highly specific ways. This review focuses on two phenomena-the loss of dendritic processes and the programmed cell death (PCD) of neurons-that can be regulated by steroid hormones (e.g. during sexual differentiation in vertebrates). In insects such as the moth, Manduca sexta, and fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, ecdysteroids orchestrate a reorganization of neural circuits during metamorphosis. In Manduca, accessory planta retractor (APR) motoneurons undergo dendritic loss at the end of larval life in response to a rise in 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Dendritic regression is associated with a decrease in the strength of monosynaptic inputs, a decrease in the number of contacts from pre-synaptic neurons, and the loss of a behavior mediated by these synapses. The APRs in different abdominal segments undergo segment-specific PCD at pupation and adult emergence that is triggered directly and cell-autonomously by a genomic action of 20E, as demonstrated in cell culture. The post-emergence death of APRs provides a model for steroid-mediated neuroprotection. APR death occurs by autophagy, not apoptosis, and involves caspase activation and the aggregation and ultracondensation of mitochondria. Manduca genes involved in segmental identity, 20E signaling and PCD are being sought by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarrays. Experiments utilizing Drosophila as a complementary system have been initiated. These insect model systems contribute toward understanding the causes and functional consequences of dendritic loss and neurodegeneration in human neurological disorders.","Typically, emotionally charged events are better remembered than neutral ones. This paper reviews data indicating that the amygdala is responsible for this facilitation of memory by emotional arousal. Pharmacological and behavioral studies have shown that the release of adrenal stress hormones facilitates memory consolidation. The available evidence suggests that this effect depends on a central action of stress hormones involving the release of the neuromodulators noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). Indeed, BLA lesions block the memory modulating effects of stress hormones. Moreover, microdialysis studies have revealed that BLA concentrations of NA and acetylcholine are transiently (2h) elevated following emotionally arousing learning episodes. Last, post-learning intra-BLA injections of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic receptor antagonists reduce retention. These results have led to the hypothesis that NA and acetylcholine increase the activity of BLA neurons in the hours after the learning episode. In turn, the BLA would facilitate synaptic plasticity in other brain structures, believed to constitute the storage sites for different types of memory. Consistent with this, post-learning treatments that reduce or enhance the excitability of BLA neurons respectively decrease or improve long-term retention on various emotionally charged learning tasks. However, a number of issues remain unresolved. Chief among them is how the BLA facilitates synaptic plasticity elsewhere in the brain. The present review concludes with a consideration of this issue based on recent advances in our understanding of the BLA. Among other possibilities, it is suggested that rhythmic BLA activity at the theta frequency during arousal as well as the uniform conduction times of BLA axons to distributed rhinal sites may promote plasticity in co-active structures of the temporal lobe.","Excitatory glutamatergic transmission involves a variety of different receptor types, each with distinct properties and functions. Physiological studies have identified both post- and presynaptic roles for kainate receptors, which are a subtype of the ionotropic glutamate receptors. Kainate receptors contribute to excitatory postsynaptic currents in many regions of the central nervous system including hippocampus, cortex, spinal cord and retina. In some cases, postsynaptic kainate receptors are co-distributed with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, but there are also synapses where transmission is mediated exclusively by postsynaptic kainate receptors: for example, in the retina at connections made by cones onto off bipolar cells. Modulation of transmitter release by presynaptic kainate receptors can occur at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The depolarization of nerve terminals by current flow through ionotropic kainate receptors appears sufficient to account for most examples of presynaptic regulation; however, a number of studies have provided evidence for metabotropic effects on transmitter release that can be initiated by activation of kainate receptors. Recent analysis of knockout mice lacking one or more of the subunits that contribute to kainate receptors, as well as studies with subunit-selective agonists and antagonists, have revealed the important roles that kainate receptors play in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. This review briefly addresses the properties of kainate receptors and considers in greater detail the physiological analysis of their contributions to synaptic transmission.","Programmed cell death or apoptosis is broadly responsible for the normal homeostatic removal of cells and has been increasingly implicated in mediating pathological cell loss in many disease states. As the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis have been extensively investigated a critical role for ionic homeostasis in apoptosis has been recently endorsed. In contrast to the ionic mechanism of necrosis that involves Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation, compelling evidence now indicates that excessive K(+) efflux and intracellular K(+) depletion are key early steps in apoptosis. Physiological concentration of intracellular K(+) acts as a repressor of apoptotic effectors. A huge loss of cellular K(+), likely a common event in apoptosis of many cell types, may serve as a disaster signal allowing the execution of the suicide program by activating key events in the apoptotic cascade including caspase cleavage, cytochrome c release, and endonuclease activation. The pro-apoptotic disruption of K(+) homeostasis can be mediated by over-activated K(+) channels or ionotropic glutamate receptor channels, and most likely, accompanied by reduced K(+) uptake due to dysfunction of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase. Recent studies indicate that, in addition to the K(+) channels in the plasma membrane, mitochondrial K(+) channels and K(+) homeostasis also play important roles in apoptosis. Investigations on the K(+) regulation of apoptosis have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the apoptotic mechanism and may afford novel therapeutic strategies for apoptosis-related diseases.","The basic motor patterns underlying rhythmic limb movements during locomotion are generated by neuronal networks located within the spinal cord. These networks are called Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). Isolated spinal cord preparations from newborn rats and mice have become increasingly important for understanding the organization of the CPG in the mammalian spinal cord. Early studies using these preparations have focused on the overall network structure and the localization of the CPG. In this review we concentrate on recent experiments aimed at identifying and characterizing CPG-interneurons in the rodent. These experiments include the organization and function of descending commissural interneurons (dCINs) in the hindlimb CPG of the neonatal rat, as well as the role of Ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) and its Ephrin ligand B3 (EphrinB3), in the construction of the mammalian locomotor network. These latter experiments have defined EphA4 as a molecular marker for mammalian excitatory hindlimb CPG neurons. We also review genetic approaches that can be applied to the mouse spinal cord. These include methods for identifying sub-populations of neurons by genetically encoded reporters, techniques to trace network connectivity with cell-specific genetically encoded tracers, and ways to selectively ablate or eliminate neuron populations from the CPG. We propose that by applying a multidisciplinary approach it will be possible to understand the network structure of the mammalian locomotor CPG. Such an understanding will be instrumental in devising new therapeutic strategies for patients with spinal cord injury.","While the hippocampus makes unique contributions to memory, it has also long been associated with sensorimotor processes, i.e. innate processes involving control of motor responses to sensory stimuli. Moreover, hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, primarily characterized by non-mnemonic deficits in the processing of and responding to sensory information. This review is concerned with the hippocampal modulation of three sensorimotor processes in rats-locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, and the startle reflex itself-whose alterations are related to human psychosis or anxiety disorders. Its main purpose is to present and discuss the picture emerging from studies examining the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus by local drug microinfusions. While a role of the hippocampus in regulating locomotor activity, PPI, and startle reactivity has also been suggested based on the effects of hippocampal lesions, the microinfusion studies have revealed additional important details of this role and suggest modifications of notions based on lesion studies. In summary, the microinfusion studies corroborate that hippocampal mechanisms can directly influence locomotor activity, PPI, and startle reactivity, and that aberrant hippocampal function may contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases, in particular psychosis. The relation between different sensorimotor processes and hippocampal neurotransmission, the role of ventral and dorsal hippocampus, and the extrahippocampal mechanisms mediating the hippocampal modulation of different sensorimotor processes can partly be dissociated. Thus, the hippocampal modulation of these sensorimotor processes appears to reflect multiple operations, rather than one unitary operation.","Several developments during the past 15 years have profoundly affected our understanding of the vomeronasal system (VNS) of vertebrates. In the mid 1990s, the vomeronasal epithelium of mammals was found to contain two populations of receptor cells, based on their expression of G-proteins. These two populations of neurons were subsequently found to project their axons to different parts of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), forming the basis of segregated pathways with possibly heterogeneous functions. A related discovery was the cloning of members of at least two gene families of putative vomeronasal G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) in the vomeronasal epithelium. Ligand binding to these receptors was found to activate a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent signal transduction pathway that primarily involves an increase in intracellular inositol-tris-phosphate and intracellular calcium. In contrast to what was previously believed, neuron replacement in the vomeronasal epithelium appears to occur through a process of vertical migration in most mammals. New anatomical studies of the central pathways of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems indicated that these two systems converge on neurons in the telencephalon, providing an anatomical substrate for functional interactions. Combined anatomical, physiological and behavioral studies in mice provided new information that furthered our understanding of one of the most striking pheromonal phenomena, the Bruce effect. Finally, contrary to prior observations, new anatomical studies indicated that a vomeronasal organ (VNO) was present in human adults and reports were published indicating that this system might be functional. These latter observations are still controversial and require confirmation from independent laboratories.","Fear is an adaptive component of the acute ""stress"" response to potentially-dangerous (external and internal) stimuli which threaten to perturb homeostasis. However, when disproportional in intensity, chronic and/or irreversible, or not associated with any genuine risk, it may be symptomatic of a debilitating anxious state: for example, social phobia, panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorder. In view of the importance of guaranteeing an appropriate emotional response to aversive events, it is not surprising that a diversity of mechanisms are involved in the induction and inhibition of anxious states. Apart from conventional neurotransmitters, such as monoamines, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, many other modulators have been implicated, including: adenosine, cannabinoids, numerous neuropeptides, hormones, neurotrophins, cytokines and several cellular mediators. Accordingly, though benzodiazepines (which reinforce transmission at GABA(A) receptors), serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonists and 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are currently the principle drugs employed in the management of anxiety disorders, there is considerable scope for the development of alternative therapies. In addition to cellular, anatomical and neurochemical strategies, behavioral models are indispensable for the characterization of anxious states and their modulation. Amongst diverse paradigms, conflict procedures--in which subjects experience opposing impulses of desire and fear--are of especial conceptual and therapeutic pertinence. For example, in the Vogel Conflict Test (VCT), the ability of drugs to release punishment-suppressed drinking behavior is evaluated. In reviewing the neurobiology of anxious states, the present article focuses in particular upon: the multifarious and complex roles of individual modulators, often as a function of the specific receptor type and neuronal substrate involved in their actions; novel targets for the management of anxiety disorders; the influence of neurotransmitters and other agents upon performance in the VCT; data acquired from complementary pharmacological and genetic strategies and, finally, several open questions likely to orientate future experimental- and clinical-research. In view of the recent proliferation of mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis, modulation and, potentially, treatment of anxiety disorders, this is an opportune moment to survey their functional and pathophysiological significance, and to assess their influence upon performance in the VCT and other models of potential anxiolytic properties.","This article reviews functional neuroimaging studies of priming, a behavioural change associated with the repeated processing of a stimulus. Using the haemodynamic techniques of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), priming-related effects have been observed in numerous regions of the human brain, with the specific regions depending on the type of stimulus and the manner in which it is processed. The most common finding is a decreased haemodynamic response for primed versus unprimed stimuli, though priming-related response increases have been observed. Attempts have been made to relate these effects to a form of implicit or ""unconscious"" memory. The priming-related decrease has also been used as a tool to map the brain regions associated with different stages of stimulus-processing, a method claimed to offer superior spatial resolution. This decrease has a potential analogue in the stimulus repetition effects measured with single-cell recording in the non-human primate. The paradigms reviewed include word-stem completion, masked priming, repetition priming of visual objects and semantic priming. An attempt is made to relate the findings within a ""component process"" framework, and the relationship between behavioural, haemodynamic and neurophysiological data is discussed. Interpretation of the findings is not always clear-cut, however, given potential confounding factors such as explicit memory, and several recommendations are made for future neuroimaging studies of priming.","The nature versus nurture debate has recently resurfaced with the emergence of the field of developmental molecular neurobiology. The questions associated with ""nature"" have crystallized into testable hypotheses regarding patterns of gene expression during development, and those associated with ""nurture"" have given over to activity-dependent cellular mechanisms that give rise to variable phenotypes in developing nervous systems. This review focuses on some of the features associated with complex brains and discusses the evolutionary and activity-dependent mechanisms that generate these features. These include increases in the size of the cortical sheet, changes in cortical domain and cortical field specification, and the activity-dependent intracellular mechanisms that regulate the structure and function of neurons during development. We discuss which features are likely to be genetically mediated, which features are likely to be regulated by activity, and how these two mechanisms act in concert to produce the wide variety of phenotypes observed for the mammalian neocortex. For example, the size of the cortical sheet is likely to be under genetic control, and regulation of cell-cycle kinetics through upregulation of genes such as beta-catenin can account for increases in the size of the cortical sheet. Similarly, intrinsic signaling genes or gene products such as Wnt, Shh, Fgf2, Fgf8 and BMP may set up a combinatorial coordinate system that guides thalamic afferents. Changes in peripheral morphology that regulate patterned activity are also likely to be under genetic control. Finally, the intracellular machinery that allows for activity-dependent plasticity in the developing CNS may be genetically regulated, although the specific phenotype they generate are not. On the other hand, aspects of neocortical organization such as sensory domain assignment, the size and shape of cortical fields, some aspects of connectivity, and details of functional organization are likely to be activity-dependent. Furthermore, the role of genes versus activity, and their interactions, may be different for primary fields versus non-primary fields.","Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a membrane-spanning protein with a large extracellular domain and a much smaller intracellular domain. It is the source of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide found in neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Because Abeta shows neurotoxic properties, and because familial forms of AD promote Abeta accumulation, a massive international research effort has been aimed at understanding the mechanisms of Abeta generation, catabolism and toxicity. APP, however, is an extremely complex molecule that may be a functionally important molecule in its full-length configuration, as well as being the source of numerous fragments with varying effects on neural function. For example, one fragment derived from the non-amyloidogenic processing pathway, secreted APPalpha (sAPPalpha), is neuroprotective, neurotrophic and regulates cell excitability and synaptic plasticity, while Abeta appears to exert opposing effects. Less is known about the neural functions of other fragments, but there is a growing interest in understanding the basic biology of APP as it has become recognized that alterations in the functional activity of the APP fragments during disease states will have complex effects on cell function. Indeed, it has been proposed that reductions in the level or activity of certain APP fragments, in addition to accumulation of Abeta, may play a critical role in the cognitive dysfunction associated with AD, particularly early in the course of the disease. To test and modify this hypothesis, it is important to understand the roles that full-length APP and its fragments normally play in neuronal structure and function. Here we review evidence addressing these fundamental questions, paying particular attention to the contributions that APP fragments play in synaptic transmission and neural plasticity, as these may be key to understanding their effects on learning and memory. It is clear from this literature that APP fragments, including Abeta, can exert a powerful regulation of key neural functions including cell excitability, synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, both acutely and over the long-term. Furthermore, there is a small but growing literature confirming that these fragments correspondingly regulate behavioral learning and memory. These data indicate that a full account of cognitive dysfunction in AD will need to incorporate the actions of the full complement of APP fragments. To this end, there is an urgent need for a dedicated research effort aimed at understanding the behavioral consequences of altered levels and activity of the different APP fragments as a result of experience and disease.","The ability of an animal to carry out its normal behavioral repertoire requires generation of an enormous diversity of neurons and glia. The relative simplicity of the spinal cord makes this an especially attractive part of the nervous system for addressing questions about the development of vertebrate neural specification and function. The last decade has witnessed an explosion in our understanding of spinal cord development and the functional interactions among spinal cord neurons and glia. Cellular, genetic, molecular, physiological and behavioral studies in zebrafish have all been important in providing insights into questions that remained unanswered by studies from other vertebrate model organisms. This is the case because many zebrafish spinal neurons can be individually identified and followed over time in living embryos and larvae. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the cellular, genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in specifying distinct cell types in the zebrafish spinal cord and how these cells establish the functional circuitry that mediates particular behaviors. We start by describing the early signals and morphogenetic movements that form the nervous system, and in particular, the spinal cord. We then provide an overview of the cell types within the spinal cord and describe how they are specified and patterned. We begin ventrally with floor plate and proceed dorsally, through motoneurons and oligodendrocytes, interneurons, astrocytes and radial glia, spinal sensory neurons and neural crest. We next describe axon pathfinding of spinal neurons. Finally, we discuss the roles of particular spinal cord neurons in specific behaviors.","Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) mediated by sarcoplasmic reticulum resident ryanodine receptors (RyRs) has been well described in cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle. In brain, RyRs are localised primarily to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and have been demonstrated in postsynaptic entities, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes where they regulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), membrane potential and the activity of a variety of second messenger systems. Recently, the contribution of presynaptic RyRs and CICR to functions of central and peripheral presynaptic terminals, including neurotransmitter release, has received increased attention. However, there is no general agreement that RyRs are localised to presynaptic terminals, nor is it clear that RyRs regulate a large enough pool of intracellular Ca(2+) to be physiologically significant. Here, we review direct and indirect evidence that on balance favours the notion that ER and RyRs are found in presynaptic terminals and are physiologically significant. In so doing, it became obvious that some of the controversy originates from issues related to (i) the ability to demonstrate conclusively the physical presence of ER and RyRs, (ii) whether the biophysical properties of RyRs are such that they can contribute physiologically to regulation of presynaptic [Ca(2+)](i), (iii) how ER Ca(2+) load and feedback gain of CICR contributes to the ability to detect functionally relevant RyRs, (iv) the distance that Ca(2+) diffuses from plasma membranes to RyRs to trigger CICR and from RyRs to the Active Zone to enhance vesicle release, and (v) the experimental conditions used. The recognition that ER Ca(2+) stores are able to modulate local Ca(2+) levels and neurotransmitter release in presynaptic terminals will aid in the understanding of the cellular mechanisms controlling neuronal function.","It is only recently that a number of studies on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and other brain areas have considered that a heterosynaptic modulatory input could be recruited as well as the coincident firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. So far, the strongest evidence for such a regulation has been attributed to dopaminergic (DA) systems but other modulatory pathways have also been considered to influence synaptic plasticity. This review will focus on dopamine contribution to synaptic plasticity in different brain areas (hippocampus, striatum and prefrontal cortex) with, for each region, a few lines on the distribution of DA projections and receptors. New insights into the possible mechanisms underlying these plastic changes will be considered. The contribution of various DA systems in certain forms of learning and memory will be reviewed with recent advances supporting the hypothesis of similar cellular mechanisms underlying DA regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory processes in which the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway has a potential role. To summarize, endogenous DA, which depends on the activity patterns of DA midbrain neurons in freely moving animals, appears as a key regulator in specific synaptic changes observed at certain stages of learning and memory and of synaptic plasticity.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol. 2004 Feb;72(2):165-6.,"In the central nervous system (CNS), adenosine is an important neuromodulator and regulates neuronal and non-neuronal cellular function (e.g. microglia) by actions on extracellular adenosine A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) receptors. Extracellular levels of adenosine are regulated by synthesis, metabolism, release and uptake of adenosine. Adenosine also regulates pain transmission in the spinal cord and in the periphery, and a number of agents can alter the extracellular availability of adenosine and subsequently modulate pain transmission, particularly by activation of adenosine A(1) receptors. The use of capsaicin (which activates receptors selectively expressed on C-fibre afferent neurons and produces neurotoxic actions in certain paradigms) allows for an interpretation of C-fibre involvement in such processes. In the spinal cord, adenosine availability/release is enhanced by depolarization (K(+), capsaicin, substance P, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)), by inhibition of metabolism or uptake (inhibitors of adenosine kinase (AK), adenosine deaminase (AD), equilibrative transporters), and by receptor-operated mechanisms (opioids, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA)). Some of these agents release adenosine via an equilibrative transporter indicating production of adenosine inside the cell (K(+), morphine), while others release nucleotide which is converted extracellularly to adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (capsaicin, 5-HT). Release can be capsaicin-sensitive, Ca(2+)-dependent and involve G-proteins, and this suggests that within C-fibres, Ca(2+)-dependent intracellular processes regulate production and release of adenosine. In the periphery, adenosine is released from both neuronal and non-neuronal sources. Neuronal release from capsaicin-sensitive afferents is induced by glutamate and by neurogenic inflammation (capsaicin, low concentration of formalin), while that from sympathetic postganglionic neurons (probably as adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) with NA) occurs following more generalized inflammation. Such release is modified differentially by inhibitors of AK and AD. Following nerve injury, there is an alteration in capsaicin-sensitive adenosine release, as spinal release now is less responsive to opioids, while peripheral release is less responsive to inhibitors of metabolism. Following inflammation, adenosine is released from a variety of cell types in addition to neurons (e.g. endothelial cells, neutrophils, mast cells, fibroblasts). ATP is released both spinally and peripherally following inflammation or injury, and may be converted to adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase contributing an additional source of adenosine. Release of adenosine from both spinal and peripheral compartments has inhibitory effects on pain transmission, as methylxanthine adenosine receptor antagonists reduce analgesia produced by agents which augment extracellular levels of adenosine spinally (morphine, 5-HT, substance P, AK inhibitors) and peripherally (AK inhibitors, AD inhibitors). Increases in extracellular adenosine availability also may contribute to antiinflammatory effects of certain agents (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, salicylates, AK inhibitors), and this could have secondary effects on pain signalling in chronic inflammation. The purpose of the present review is to consider: (a). the factors that regulate the extracellular availability of adenosine in the spinal cord and at peripheral sites; and (b). the extent to which this adenosine affects pain signalling in these two distinct compartments.","Apoptosis has been recognized to be an essential process during neural development. It is generally assumed that about half of the neurons produced during neurogenesis die before completion of the central nervous system (CNS) maturation, and this process affects nearly all classes of neurons. In this review, we discuss the experimental data in vivo on naturally occurring neuronal death in normal, transgenic and mutant animals, with special attention to the cerebellum as a study model. The emerging picture is that of a dual wave of apoptotic cell death affecting central neurons at different stages of their life. The first wave consists of an early neuronal death of proliferating precursors and young postmitotic neuroblasts, and appears to be closely linked to cell cycle regulation. The second wave affects postmitotic neurons at later stages, and is much better understood in functional terms, mainly on the basis of the neurotrophic concept in its broader definition. The molecular machinery of late apoptotic death of postmitotic neurons more commonly follows the mitochondrial pathway of intracellular signal transduction, but the death receptor pathway may also be involved.Undoubtedly, analysis of naturally occurring neuronal death (NOND) in vivo will offer a basis for parallel and future studies aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of pathologic neuronal loss occurring as the result of conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, trauma or ischemia.","Diabetic neuropathy is the most common peripheral neuropathy in western countries. Although every effort has been made to clarify the pathogenic mechanism of diabetic neuropathy, thereby devising its ideal therapeutic drugs, neither convinced hypotheses nor unequivocally effective drugs have been established. In view of the pathologic basis for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, it is important to enhance nerve regeneration as well as prevent nerve degeneration. Nerve regeneration or sprouting in diabetes may occur not only in the nerve trunk but also in the dermis and around dorsal root ganglion neurons, thereby being implicated in the generation of pain sensation. Thus, inadequate nerve regeneration unequivocally contributes to the pathophysiologic mechanism of diabetic neuropathy. In this context, the research on nerve regeneration in diabetes should be more accelerated. Indeed, nerve regenerative capacity has been shown to be decreased in diabetic patients as well as in diabetic animals. Disturbed nerve regeneration in diabetes has been ascribed at least in part to all or some of decreased levels of neurotrophic factors, decreased expression of their receptors, altered cellular signal pathways and/or abnormal expression of cell adhesion molecules, although the mechanisms of their changes remain almost unclear. In addition to their steady-state changes in diabetes, nerve injury induces injury-specific changes in individual neurotrophic factors, their receptors and their intracellular signal pathways, which are closely linked with altered neuronal function, varying from neuronal survival and neurite extension/nerve regeneration to apoptosis. Although it is essential to clarify those changes for understanding the mechanism of disturbed nerve regeneration in diabetes, very few data are now available. Rationally accepted replacement therapy with neurotrophic factors has not provided any success in treating diabetic neuropathy. Aside from adverse effects of those factors, more rigorous consideration for their delivery system may be needed for any possible success. Although conventional therapeutic drugs like aldose reductase (AR) inhibitors and vasodilators have been shown to enhance nerve regeneration, their efficacy should be strictly evaluated with respect to nerve regenerative capacity. For this purpose, especially clinically, skin biopsy, by which cutaneous nerve pathology including nerve regeneration can be morphometrically evaluated, might be a safe and useful examination.","The development of the nervous system entails the coordination of the spatial and chemical development of both pre- and postsynaptic elements. This coordination is accomplished by signals passing between neurons and the target cells that they innervate. This review focuses on well-characterized examples of target-mediated neuronal differentiation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These include control of neurogenesis in the leech by male genitalia, presynaptic differentiation induced by postsynaptic molecules expressed by skeletal muscle, postsynaptic adhesion molecules that induce presynaptic differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS), target-mediated control of neurotransmitter phenotype in peripheral neurons, and target-regulated control of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK). The detailed understanding of these processes will uncover signals critical for the directed differentiation of stem cells as well as identify future targets for therapies in neural regeneration that promote the reestablishment of functional connections.","The advent of proteomics techniques has been enthusiastically accepted in most areas of biology and medicine. In neuroscience, a host of applications was proposed ranging from neurotoxicology, neurometabolism, determination of the proteome of the individual brain areas in health and disease, to name a few. Only recently, the limitations of the method have been shown, hampering the rapid spreading of the technology, which in principle consists of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with in-gel protein digestion of protein spots and identification by mass-spectrometrical approaches or microsequencing. The identification, including quantification using specific software, of brain protein classes, like enzymes, cytoskeleton proteins, heat shock proteins/chaperones, proteins of the transcription and translation machinery, synaptosomal proteins, antioxidant proteins, is a clear domain of proteomics. Furthermore, the concomitant detection of several hundred proteins on a gel allows the demonstration of an expressional pattern, rather generated by a reliable, protein-chemical method than by immunoreactivity, proposed by protein-arrays. An additional advantage is that hitherto unknown proteins, so far only proposed from their nucleic acid structure, designated as hypothetical proteins, can be identified as brain proteins. As to shortcomings and disadvantages of the method we would point to the major problem, the failure to separate hydrophobic proteins. There is so far no way to analyse the vast majority of these proteins in gels. Several other analytical problems need to be overcome, but once the latter problem can be solved, there is nothing to stop the method for a large scale analysis of membrane proteins in neuroscience.","Over the past century, the average lifespan of women has increased from 50 to over 80 years, but the age of the menopause has remained fixed at 51 years. This ""change of life"" is marked by a dramatic and permanent decrease in circulating levels of ovarian estrogens. Therefore, more women will live a greater proportion of their lives in a chronic hypoestrogenic state. Ovarian steroid hormones are pleiotropic and have multiple, diverse, and possibly opposing actions in different contexts. In light of recent reports of the possible health risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on several different physiological systems, the question of whether estrogens are protective or risk factors must be carefully re-evaluated.","Aging is associated with specific impairments of learning and memory, some of which are similar to those caused by hippocampal damage. Studies of the effects of aging on hippocampal anatomy, physiology, plasticity, and network dynamics may lead to a better understanding of age-related cognitive deficits. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies indicate that the hippocampus of the aged rat sustains a loss of synapses in the dentate gyrus, a loss of functional synapses in area CA1, a decrease in the NMDA-receptor-mediated response at perforant path synapses onto dentate gyrus granule cells, and an alteration of Ca(2+) regulation in area CA1. These changes may contribute to the observed age-related impairments of synaptic plasticity, which include deficits in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and lower thresholds for depotentiation and long-term depression (LTD). This shift in the balance of LTP and LTD could, in turn, impair the encoding of memories and enhance the erasure of memories, and therefore contribute to cognitive deficits experienced by many aged mammals. Altered synaptic plasticity may also change the dynamic interactions among cells in hippocampal networks, causing deficits in the storage and retrieval of information about the spatial organization of the environment. Further studies of the aged hippocampus will not only lead to treatments for age-related cognitive impairments, but may also clarify the mechanisms of learning in adult mammals.","After a severe episode of ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or epilepsy, it is typical to find necrotic cell death within the injury core. In addition, a substantial number of neurons in regions surrounding the injury core have been observed to die via the programmed cell death (PCD) pathways due to secondary effects derived from the various types of insults. Apart from the cell loss in the injury core, cell death in regions surrounding the injury core may also contribute to significant losses in neurological functions. In fact, it is the injured neurons in these regions around the injury core that treatments are targeting to preserve. In this review, we present our cumulated understanding of stress-activated signaling pathways and apoptotic pathways in the research areas of ischemic injury, TBI and epilepsy and that gathered from concerted research efforts in oncology and other diseases. However, it is obvious that our understanding of these pathways in the context of acute brain injury is at its infancy stage and merits further investigation. Hopefully, this added research effort will provide a more detailed knowledge from which better therapeutic strategies can be developed to treat these acute brain injuries.","The hypothesis that sleep promotes learning and memory has long been a subject of active investigation. This hypothesis implies that sleep must facilitate synaptic plasticity in some way, and recent studies have provided evidence for such a function. Our knowledge of both the cellular neurophysiology of sleep states and of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity has expanded considerably in recent years. In this article, we review findings in these areas and discuss possible mechanisms whereby the neurophysiological processes characteristic of sleep states may serve to facilitate synaptic plasticity. We address this issue first on the cellular level, considering how activation of T-type Ca(2+) channels in nonREM sleep may promote either long-term depression or long-term potentiation, as well as how cellular events of REM sleep may influence these processes. We then consider how synchronization of neuronal activity in thalamocortical and hippocampal-neocortical networks in nonREM sleep and REM sleep could promote differential strengthening of synapses according to the degree to which activity in one neuron is synchronized with activity in other neurons in the network. Rather than advocating one specific cellular hypothesis, we have intentionally taken a broad approach, describing a range of possible mechanisms whereby sleep may facilitate synaptic plasticity on the cellular and/or network levels. We have also provided a general review of evidence for and against the hypothesis that sleep does indeed facilitate learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.","There has been enormous progress in uncovering the contributions of the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the developing brain. Here, we review the roles of four anatomically defined embryologic divisions of the SVZ of the mammalian brain: the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE), the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), and the fetal neocortical SVZ (SVZn), as well as the roles of the two major anatomically defined regions of the postnatal SVZ, the anterior SVZ (SVZa) and the dorsolateral SVZ (SVZdl). We describe the types of cells within each subdivision of the SVZ, the types of brain cells that they generate during embryonic, fetal, and perinatal development, and when known the mechanisms that regulate their differentiation. This review provides a critical analysis of the literature, from which current and future studies on the SVZ can be formulated and evaluated.","Despite the fact that Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relatively common neurological condition, the physiological derangements that result in its clinical features remain unclear. On combining findings from psychophysical, clinical and electrophysiological studies, an overriding theme is proposed that PD deficits are essentially quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. This may arise because the normal function of the basal ganglia is to activate neural processes selectively, providing appropriate diversion of ""attentional"" resources for decision-making aspects of motor tasks and appropriate ""energising"" of the executive aspects of such tasks. It is suggested that these concepts of attention, an idea stemming from psychophysical studies, and of energisation, which has derived from kinematic studies, may in fact reflect the same universal process of selective facilitation of particular processes and inhibition of others. In PD, without efficient facilitation, tasks may still be performed but less well than in normal individuals. Possible underlying mechanisms of basal ganglial function are discussed in the context of new findings on direct and indirect pathway actions and the role that oscillatory modulations may play in achieving selective facilitation is explored. Further investigation of disturbances of such mechanisms in PD may prove important in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the condition.","Sound communication is not unique to humans but rather is a trait shared with most non-mammalian vertebrates. A practical way to address questions of vocal signal encoding has been to identify mechanisms in non-mammalian model systems that use acoustic communication signals in their social behavior. Teleost fishes, the largest group of living vertebrates, include both vocal and non-vocal species that exploit a wide range of acoustic niches. Here, we focus on those vocal species where combined behavioral and neurobiological studies have recently begun to elucidate a suite of adaptations for both the production and the perception of acoustic signals essential to their reproductive success and survival. Studies of these model systems show that teleost fish have the vocal-acoustic behaviors and neural systems both necessary and sufficient to solve acoustic problems common to all vertebrates. In particular, behavioral studies demonstrate that temporal features within a call, including pulse duration, rate and number, can all be important to a call's communicative value. Neurobiological studies have begun to show how these features are produced by a vocal motor system extending from forebrain to hindbrain levels and are encoded by peripheral and central auditory neurons. The abundance and variety of vocal fish present unique opportunities for parallel investigations of neural encoding, perception, and communication across a diversity of natural, acoustic habitats. As such, investigations in teleosts contribute to our delineating the evolution of the vocal and auditory systems of both non-mammalian and mammalian species, including humans.","Taking a comparative approach, data from a range of visual species are discussed in the context of ideas about mechanisms of motion detection. The cellular basis of motion detection in the vertebrate retina, sub-cortical structures and visual cortex is reviewed alongside that of the insect optic lobes. Special care is taken to relate concepts from theoretical models to the neural circuitry in biological systems. Motion detection involves spatiotemporal pre-filters, temporal delay filters and non-linear interactions. A number of different types of non-linear mechanism such as facilitation, inhibition and division have been proposed to underlie direction selectivity. The resulting direction-selective mechanisms can be combined to produce speed-tuned motion detectors. Motion detection is a dynamic process with adaptation as a fundamental property. The behavior of adaptive mechanisms in motion detection is discussed, focusing on the informational basis of motion adaptation, its phenomenology in human vision, and its cellular basis. The question of whether motion adaptation serves a function or is simply the result of neural fatigue is critically addressed.","During development of the central nervous system, growth cones navigate along specific pathways, recognize their targets and then form synaptic connections by elaborating terminal arbors. To date, a number of developmental and in vitro studies have characterized the nature of the guidance cues that underlie various types of axonal behavior, from initial outgrowth to synapse formation, including pathway selection, polarized growth, orientated growth, termination and branching. New approaches in molecular biology have identified several types of guidance cues, most of which are likely to act as local cues. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that axonal responsiveness to guidance cues changes dynamically, which appears to be elicited by environmental factors encountered by the navigating growth cones. This article addresses what molecular cues are responsible for guidance mechanisms including axonal responsiveness, focusing on axonal behavior in the developmental stages.","Adenosine is a ubiquitous homeostatic substance released from most cells, including neurones and glia. Once in the extracellular space, adenosine modifies cell functioning by operating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR; A(1), A(2A), A(2B), A(3)) that can inhibit (A(1)) or enhance (A(2)) neuronal communication. Interactions between adenosine receptors and other G-protein-coupled receptors, ionotropic receptors and receptors for neurotrophins also occur, and this might contribute to a fine-tuning of neuronal function. Manipulations of adenosine receptors influence sleep and arousal, cognition and memory, neuronal damage and degeneration, as well as neuronal maturation. These actions might have therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, as well as for other neurological situations such as epilepsy, idiopathic pain or even drug addition. Peripheral side effects associated with adenosine receptor agonists limit their usefulness in therapeutics; in contrast, adenosine receptor antagonists appear to have less side effects as it is the case of the well-known non-selective antagonists theophylline (present in tea) or caffeine (abundant in coffee and tea), and their emerging beneficial actions in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are encouraging. A(1) receptor antagonism may also be useful to enhance cognition and facilitate arousal, as well as in the periphery when deficits of neurotransmitter release occur (e.g. myasthenic syndromes). Enhancement of extracellular adenosine levels through drugs that influence its metabolism might prove useful approaches in situations such as neuropathic pain, where enhanced activation of inhibitory adenosine A(1) receptors is beneficial. One might then consider adenosine as a fine-tuning modulator of neuronal activity, which via subtle effects causes harmonic actions on neuronal activity. Whenever this homeostasis is disrupted, pathology may be installed and selective receptor antagonism or agonism required.","Demyelination is the pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. The concept of remyelination has gained acceptance in recent years, but naturally occurring remyelination is incomplete. To improve repair processes, a number of strategies have been explored experimentally and clinical trials are being carried out. In principle, remyelination can be achieved by either promoting endogenous repair mechanisms or by providing an exogenous source of myelinating cells via transplantation. Both approaches have been successful in animal models of demyelination. Besides, many studies have elucidated principal mechanisms of oligodendrocyte biology and remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). This progress in knowledge also allowed for more specific interventions. First clinical trials to enhance endogenous remyelination have been performed, unfortunately with disappointingly negative results. This illustrates that experimental data cannot be easily transferred to human disease, and more detailed knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms of remyelination in MS is required. Recently, the first MS patient received a transplant of autologous Schwann cells. Many other cell types are being studied experimentally, including stem cells. Despite the ethical problems associated with an embryonic cell source, new developments in stem cell biology indicate that adult stem cells or bone marrow-derived cells may substitute for embryonic cells in the future. In this review, we describe the current views on oligodendrocyte biology, myelination and remyelination, and focus on recent developments leading to reconstructing, remyelinating strategies in MS.","Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), composed of 12 subunits (alpha2-alpha10, beta2-beta4), are expressed in autonomic ganglia, playing a central role in autonomic transmission. The repertoire of nicotinic subunits in autonomic ganglia includes alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, beta2 and beta4 subunits. In the last 10 years, heterologous expression studies have revealed much about the nature of neuronal nAChRs. However, there is only limited understanding of subunit actions in autonomic system. Functional deletions of subunit by gene knockout in animals could overcome these limitations. We review recent studies on nAChRs on autonomic ganglia for physiological and pharmacological properties and potential locations of the subunits.","The symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) were first described nearly two centuries ago and its characteristic pathology identified nearly a century ago, yet its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Parkinson's disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder and research into its pathogenesis recently accelerated following the identification of a number of causal genetic mutations. The mutant gene products all cause dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteosome system, identifying protein modification and degradation as critical for pathogenesis. Modified non-degraded intracellular proteins accumulate in certain neuronal populations in all forms of the disease. However, neuronal degeneration is more highly selective and associates with substantial activation of microglia, the inflammatory cells of the brain. We review the current change in thinking regarding the role of microglia in the brain in the context of Parkinson's disease and animal models of the disease. Comparison of the cellular tissue changes across a number of animal models using diverse stimuli to mimic Parkinson's disease reveals a consistent pattern implicating microglia as the effector for the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. While previous reviews have concentrated on the intracellular neuronal changes in Parkinson's disease, we highlight the cell to cell interactions and immune regulation critical for neuronal homeostasis and survival in Parkinson's disease.","A wide range of central nervous system (CNS) disorders include neuroinflammatory events that perturb blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mechanisms by which the BBB responds to physiological and pathological stimuli involve signaling systems in the tight and adherens junctions of the cerebral endothelium. In this review, we examine the molecular composition and regulatory mediators that control BBB permeability and assess how these mediators may be dysregulated in stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and meningioencephalitis. An understanding of these molecular substrates in BBB regulation may lead to new approaches for enhancing CNS drug delivery and ameliorating brain edema after injury and inflammation.","Transporters able to recapture released neurotransmitters into neurons can no longer be considered as cell-specific neuronal markers. In fact, colocalization on one nerve terminal of transporters able to selectively recapture the released endogenously synthesized transmitter (homotransporters) and of transporters that can selectively take up transmitters/modulators originating from neighboring structures (heterotransporters) has been demonstrated to occur on several families of nerve terminals. Activation of heterotransporters often increases the release of the transmitter stored in the terminals on which the heterotransporters are localized. The release caused by heterotransporter activation takes place through multiple mechanisms including exocytosis, either dependent on external Ca(2+) or on Ca(2+) mobilized from intraterminal stores, and homotransporter reversal. Homocarrier-mediated release elicited by heterocarrier activation represents a clear case of transporter-transporter interaction. Although the functional significance of transporter coexpression on one nerve terminal remains to be established, it may in some instances reflect cotransmission. In other cases, heterotransporters may mediate modulation of basal transmitter release in addition to the modulation of the evoked release brought about by presynaptic heteroreceptors. Heterotransporters are also increasingly reported to exist on neuronal soma/dendrites. With the exception of EAAT4, the glutamate transporter/chloride channel situated on GABAergic Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, the functions of somatodendritic heterocarriers is not understood.","This review covers recent developments in the cellular neurophysiology of retrograde signaling in the mammalian central nervous system. Normally at a chemical synapse a neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses to the postsynaptic element, where it binds to and activates receptors. In retrograde signaling a diffusible messenger is liberated from the postsynaptic element, and travels ""backwards"" across the synaptic cleft, where it activates receptors on the presynaptic cell. Receptors for retrograde messengers are usually located on or near the presynaptic nerve terminals, and their activation causes an alteration in synaptic transmitter release. Although often considered in the context of long-term synaptic plasticity, retrograde messengers have numerous roles on the short-term regulation of synaptic transmission. The focus of this review will be on a group of molecules from different chemical classes that appear to act as retrograde messengers. The evidence supporting their candidacy as retrograde messengers is considered and evaluated. Endocannabinoids have recently emerged as one of the most thoroughly investigated, and widely accepted, classes of retrograde messenger in the brain. The study of the endocannabinoids can therefore serve as a model for the investigation of other putative messengers, and most attention is devoted to a discussion of systems that use these new messenger molecules.","In the mammalian hippocampus, there is a trisynaptic loop that has been often referred to in studies on learning and memory mechanisms and their physiological correlate, the long-term potentiation (LTP). The three sets of synapses are formed by the fibers of perforant pathway terminating on granule cells and by the mossy fibers and Schaeffer collaterals making connections with the pyramidal cells. Each of the three types of synapses can develop LTP. LTP is accompanied by changes in gene expression and it is the nuclear transcription, involving specific transcription factors, that is the starting point for the series of biological amplifications and consolidations both necessary for such sustained changes. The transcription factors are proteins that control gene expression, development and functional formation in every eukaryotic cell. Two categories of transcription factors have been defined to date: general factors that comprise at least 20 proteins to form multiple preinitiation complex at the TATA box (TATA rich sequence) or regulatory factors that bind to promoter or enhancer regions at specific sites on the DNA close to, or distant from, the TATA box. Transcription factors have been divided into five different major classes according to unique protein motifs. These include basic domain, zinc-finger, helix-turn-helix, beta-Scaffold factors with minor groove contacts and other transcription factors not specifically classified. Much evidence has been accumulating in favor of the participation of several transcription factors in the consolidation of memory in the mammalian hippocampus following a spatial memory task. It is, therefore, of great importance that the involvement of transcription factors in de novo protein synthesis relevant to the synaptic mechanisms that mediate the formation of long-term memory should be summarized and discussed. No specific correlation between transduction of extracellular signals and expression of nuclear transcription factors, however, has been demonstrated to date.","Self-supervised models of how the brain represents and categorises the causes of its sensory input can be divided into two classes: those that minimise the mutual information (i.e. redundancy) among evoked responses and those that minimise the prediction error. Although these models have similar goals, the way they are attained, and the functional architectures employed, can be fundamentally different. This review describes the two classes of models and their implications for the functional anatomy of sensory cortical hierarchies in the brain. We then consider how empirical evidence can be used to disambiguate between architectures that are sufficient for perceptual learning and synthesis. Most models of representational learning require prior assumptions about the distribution of sensory causes. Using the notion of empirical Bayes, we show that these assumptions are not necessary and that priors can be learned in a hierarchical context. Furthermore, we try to show that learning can be implemented in a biologically plausible way. The main point made in this review is that backward connections, mediating internal or generative models of how sensory inputs are caused, are essential if the process generating inputs cannot be inverted. Because these processes are dynamical in nature, sensory inputs correspond to a non-invertible nonlinear convolution of causes. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i.e. backward connections) to enable approximate recognition and suggests that feedforward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient. Moreover, nonlinearities in generative models, that induce a dependence on backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory; so that estimated causes in higher cortical levels can interact to predict responses in lower levels. This is important in relation to functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections that have been demonstrated empirically. To ascertain whether backward influences are expressed functionally requires measurements of functional integration among brain systems. This review summarises approaches to integration in terms of effective connectivity and proceeds to address the question posed by the theoretical considerations above. In short, it will be shown that functional neuroimaging can be used to test for interactions between bottom-up and top-down inputs to an area. The conclusion of these studies points toward the prevalence of top-down influences and the plausibility of generative models of sensory brain function.","The zebrafish is a leading model for studies of vertebrate development and genetics. Its embryonic motor behaviors are easy to assess (e.g. for mutagenic screens), the embryos develop rapidly (hatching as larvae at 2 days) and are transparent, permitting calcium imaging and patch clamp recording in vivo. We review primarily the recent advances in understanding the cellular basis for the development of motor activities in the developing zebrafish. The motor activities are generated largely in the spinal cord and hindbrain. In the embryo these segmented structures possess a relatively small number of repeating sets of identifiable neurons. Many types of neurons as well as the two types of muscle cells have been classified based on their morphologies. Some of the molecular signals for cellular differentiation have been identified recently and mutations affecting cell development have been isolated. Embryonic motor behaviors appear in sequence and consist of an early period of transient spontaneous coiling contractions, followed by the emergence of twitching responses to touch, and later by the ability to swim. Coiling contractions are generated by an electrically coupled network of a subset of spinal neurons whereas a chemical (glutamatergic and glycinergic) synaptic drive underlies touch responses and swimming. Swimming becomes sustained in larvae once the neuromodulatory serotonergic system develops. These results indicate many similarities between developing zebrafish and other vertebrates in the properties of the synaptic drive underlying locomotion. Therefore, the zebrafish is a useful preparation for gaining new insights into the development of the neural control of vertebrate locomotion. As the types of neurons, transmitters, receptors and channels used in the locomotor network are being defined, this opens the possibility of combining cellular neurophysiology with forward and reverse molecular genetics to understand the principles of locomotor network assembly and function.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of degenerative dementia and is characterized by progressive impairment in cognitive function during mid- to late-adult life. Brains from AD patients show several distinct neuropathological features, including extracellular beta-amyloid-containing plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of abnormally phosphorylated tau, and degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. In this review, we will present evidence implicating involvement of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in AD pathogenesis and its accompanying cognitive deficits. We will initially discuss recent results indicating a link between cholinergic mechanisms and the pathogenic events that characterize AD, notably amyloid-beta peptides. Following this, animal models of dementia will be discussed in light of the relationship between basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairments in AD. Finally, past, present, and future treatment strategies aimed at alleviating the cognitive symptomatology of AD by improving basal forebrain cholinergic function will be addressed.","Seizures in patients presenting with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy result from the interaction among neuronal networks in limbic structures such as the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, one of the most common forms of partial epilepsy in adulthood, is generally accompanied by a pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis. Limbic seizures can be mimicked in vitro using preparations of combined hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing convulsants or nominally zero Mg(2+), in order to produce epileptiform synchronization. Here, we summarize experimental evidence obtained in such slices from rodents. These data indicate that in control animals: (i) prolonged, NMDA receptor-dependent epileptiform discharges, resembling electrographic limbic seizures, originate in the entorhinal cortex from where they propagate to the hippocampus via the perforant path-dentate gyrus route; (ii) the initiation and maintenance of these ictal discharges is paradoxically contributed by GABA (mainly type A) receptor-mediated mechanisms; and (iii) CA3 outputs, which relay a continuous pattern of interictal discharge at approximately 1Hz, control rather than sustain ictal discharge generation in entorhinal cortex. Recent work indicates that such a control is weakened in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy (presumably as a result of CA3 cell damage). In addition, in these experiments electrographic seizure activity spreads directly to the CA1-subiculum regions through the temporoammonic pathway. Studies reviewed here indicate that these changes in network interactions, along with other mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. axonal sprouting, decreased activation of interneurons, upregulation of bursting neurons) can confer to the epileptic, damaged limbic system, the ability to produce recurrent limbic seizures as seen in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.","Neuropeptides in insects act as neuromodulators in the central and peripheral nervous system and as regulatory hormones released into the circulation. The functional roles of insect neuropeptides encompass regulation of homeostasis, organization of behaviors, initiation and coordination of developmental processes and modulation of neuronal and muscular activity. With the completion of the sequencing of the Drosophila genome we have obtained a fairly good estimate of the total number of genes encoding neuropeptide precursors and thus the total number of neuropeptides in an insect. At present there are 23 identified genes that encode predicted neuropeptides and an additional seven encoding insulin-like peptides in Drosophila. Since the number of G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors in Drosophila is estimated to be around 40, the total number of neuropeptide genes in this insect will probably not exceed three dozen. The neuropeptides can be grouped into families, and it is suggested here that related peptides encoded on a Drosophila gene constitute a family and that peptides from related genes (orthologs) in other species belong to the same family. Some peptides are encoded as multiple related isoforms on a precursor and it is possible that many of these isoforms are functionally redundant. The distribution and possible functions of members of the 23 neuropeptide families and the insulin-like peptides are discussed. It is clear that each of the distinct neuropeptides are present in specific small sets of neurons and/or neurosecretory cells and in some cases in cells of the intestine or certain peripheral sites. The distribution patterns vary extensively between types of neuropeptides. Another feature emerging for many insect neuropeptides is that they appear to be multifunctional. One and the same peptide may act both in the CNS and as a circulating hormone and play different functional roles at different central and peripheral targets. A neuropeptide can, for instance, act as a coreleased signal that modulates the action of a classical transmitter and the peptide action depends on the cotransmitter and the specific circuit where it is released. Some peptides, however, may work as molecular switches and trigger specific global responses at a given time. Drosophila, in spite of its small size, is now emerging as a very favorable organism for the studies of neuropeptide function due to the arsenal of molecular genetics methods available.","Activity-dependent synaptic modification must occur specifically to preserve the large information storage capacity of neurons. Since long-term changes in synaptic strength require gene expression and new protein synthesis we consider the role that gene expression plays in the specificity of synaptic modification. Ca2+ influx is essential for transducing synaptic activity into gene expression. Different temporal profiles of increased global Ca2+ and different types of Ca2+ channel have been demonstrated to produce different effects in the nucleus. It is possible therefore that synaptic activity may produce different programs of gene expression which may in turn control specific long-term changes in synaptic strength. We review recent data which suggest that the spatial properties of Ca2+ influx may provide a mechanism for the selective activation of molecules which signal to the nucleus. In particular, we describe data which suggests that Ca2+ channels may function in signal complexes at the synapse to propagate signals that contribute to distinct nuclear responses.","The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) contains two major classes of macroglial cells, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the formation of myelin in the central nervous system, while the functions of astrocytes are more diverse and less well established. Recent studies have provided new insights into when, where and how these different classes of cell arise during CNS development. The founder cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage initially arise in distinct regions of the ventricular zone during early development as the result of local signals including sonic hedgehog. In the spinal cord, oligodendrocyte precursors appear to share a developmental lineage with motor neurons, although they may also develop from restricted glial precursors. Immature oligodendrocyte precursors are highly migratory. They migrate from their site of origin to developing white matter tracts using a variety of guidance cues including diffusible chemorepellents. The majority of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation occurs in developing white matter as a result of the local expression of mitogenic signals. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation is regulated by a number of distinct growth factors that act at distinct stages in the lineage and whose activity is modulated by synergy with other molecules including chemokines. The final matching of oligodendrocyte and axon number is accomplished through a combination of local regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death. Not all oligodendrocyte precursors differentiate during development, and the adult CNS contains a significant population of precursors. Understanding the regulation of oligodendrogenesis will facilitate the use of these endogenous precursors to enhance repair in a variety of pathological conditions.","The mechanisms through which LHRH-secreting neurons are controlled still represent a crucial and debated field of research in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. In the present review, we have specifically considered two potential signals reaching these hypothalamic neurons: steroid hormones and growth factors. Examples of the relevant physiological role of the interactions between these two families of biologically acting molecules have been provided. In many cases, these interactions occur at the level of hypothalamic astrocytes, which are presently accepted as functional partners of the LHRH-secreting neurons. On the basis of the observations here summarized, we have formulated the hypothesis that a functional co-operation of steroid hormones and growth factors occurring in the hypothalamic astrocytic compartment represents a key factor in the neuroendocrine control of reproductive functions.","The application of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the study of human disease using small animals has steadily evolved over the past two decades and strongly established the fields of ""small animal MR imaging"" and ""MR microscopy."" An increasing number of neuroscience related investigations now implement MR microscopy in their experiments. Research areas of growth pertaining to MR microscopy studies are focused on (1). phenotyping of genetically engineered mice models of human neurological diseases and (2). rodent brain atlases. MR microscopy can be performed in vitro on tissue specimens, ex vivo on brain slice preparations and in vivo (typically on rodents). Like most new imaging technologies, MR microscopy is technologically demanding and requires broad expertise. Uniform guidelines or ""standards"" of a given MR microscopy experiment are non-existent. The main focus therefore of this review will be on biological applications of MR microscopy and the experimental requirements. We also take a critical look at the biological information that small animal (rodent) MR imaging has provided in neuroscience research.","Noradrenaline release in areas within the forebrain occurs following activation of noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus (LoC). Release of noradrenaline by attentional/arousal/vigilance factors appears to be essential for learning and is responsible for the consolidation of memory. Noradrenaline can activate any of nine different adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes in the brain and selectivity of action may be achieved by the spatial location and relative density of the AR subtypes, by different affinities of the different subtypes and by temporal selectivity in terms of when the different ARs are activated in the memory formation process. This review examines the use of selective agonists and antagonists to determine the roles of the AR subtypes in the one-trial discriminated avoidance learning paradigm in the chick. A model is developed that integrates noradrenergic activity in basal ganglia (lobus parolfactorius (LPO)) and association cortex (intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV)) leading to the consolidation of memory 30 min after training. There is evidence that beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs are important in the association area but require input from alpha(2)-AR stimulated activity in the basal ganglia for consolidation. On the other hand, alpha(1)-AR activation in the IMHV is inhibitory and prevents consolidation. While there is no role for beta(1)-ARs in memory consolidation, they play a role in short-term memory (STM). The use of the precocial chick has clear advantages in having a temporally discrete learning task which allows for discrimination memory and whose development can be followed at discrete intervals after learning. These studies reveal clear roles for AR subtypes in the formation and consolidation of memory in the chick, which have allowed the development of a model that can now be tested in mammalian systems.","Cerebral concussion is both the most common and most puzzling type of traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is normally produced by acceleration (or deceleration) of the head and is characterized by a sudden brief impairment of consciousness, paralysis of reflex activity and loss of memory. It has long been acknowledged that one of the most worthwhile techniques for studying the acute pathophysiology of concussion is by the recording of neurophysiological activity such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and sensory evoked potentials (EPs) from experimental animals. In the first parts of this review, the majority of such studies conducted during the past half century are critically reviewed. When potential methodological flaws and limitations such as anesthetic protocols, infliction of multiple blows and delay in onset of recordings were taken into account, two general principles could be adduced. First, the immediate post-concussive EEG was excitatory or epileptiform in nature. Second, the cortical EP waveform was totally lost during this period. In the second parts of this review, five theories of concussion which have been prominent during the past century are summarized and supportive evidence assessed. These are the vascular, reticular, centripetal, pontine cholinergic and convulsive hypotheses. It is concluded that only the convulsive theory is readily compatible with the neurophysiological data and can provide a totally viable explanation for concussion. The chief tenet of the convulsive theory is that since the symptoms of concussion bear a strong resemblance to those of a generalized epileptic seizure, then it is a reasonable assumption that similar pathobiological processes underlie them both. Further, it is demonstrated that EPs and EEGs recorded acutely following concussive trauma are indeed the same or similar to those obtained following the induction of a state of generalized seizure activity (GSA). According to the present incarnation of the convulsive theory, the energy imparted to the brain by the sudden mechanical loading of the head may generate turbulent rotatory and other movements of the cerebral hemispheres and so increase the chances of a tissue-deforming collision or impact between the cortex and the boney walls of the skull. In this conception, loss of consciousness is not orchestrated by disruption or interference with the function of the brainstem reticular activating system. Rather, it is due to functional deafferentation of the cortex as a consequence of diffuse mechanically-induced depolarization and synchronized discharge of cortical neurons. A convulsive theory can also explain traumatic amnesia, autonomic disturbances and the miscellaneous collection of symptoms of the post-concussion syndrome more adequately than any of its rivals. In addition, the symptoms of minor concussion (a.k.a. being stunned, dinged, or dazed) are often strikingly similar to minor epilepsy such as petit mal. The relevance of the convulsive theory to a number of associated problems is also discussed. These include the relationship between concussion and more serious types of closed head injury, the utility of animal models of severe brain trauma, the etiology of the cognitive deficits which may linger long after a concussive injury, the use of concussive (captive bolt) techniques to stun farm animals prior to slaughter and the question of why some animals (such as the woodpecker) can tolerate massive accelerative forces without being knocked out.","Hyperammonemia resulting from inherited urea cycle enzyme deficiencies or liver failure results in severe central nervous system dysfunction including brain edema, convulsions and coma. Neuropathologic evaluation in these disorders reveals characteristic alterations of astrocyte morphology ranging from cell swelling (acute hyperammonemia) to Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic hyperammonemia). Having no effective urea cycle, brain relies on glutamine synthesis for the removal of excess ammonia and the enzyme responsible, glutamine synthetase, has a predominantly astrocytic localization. Accumulation of ammonia in brain results in a redistribution of cerebral blood flow and metabolism from cortical to sub-cortical structures. In addition to changes in astrocyte morphology, increased brain ammonia concentrations result in alterations in expression of key astrocyte proteins including glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate and glycine transporters and ""peripheral-type"" (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Such changes result in alterations of astrocytic volume and increased extracellular concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory substances. In addition, the ammonium ion has direct effects on excitatory-inhibitory transmission via distinct mechanisms involving cellular chloride extrusion and postsynaptic receptor function. Acute ammonia exposure leads to activation of NMDA receptors and their signal transduction pathways. Chronic hyperammonemia also results in increased concentrations of neuroactive L-tryptophan metabolites including serotonin and quinolinic acid. Therapy in hyperammonemic syndromes continues to rely on ammonia-lowering strategies via peripheral mechanisms (reduction of ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract, increased ammonia removal by muscle).","Ginkgo biloba extracts such as EGb-761 have been suggested to have a multitude of beneficial effects on CNS function, from enhancing cognitive function in dementia to facilitating recovery from acute forms of neural damage such as hypoxia/ischemia. Ginkgolide B, one of the major components of EGb-761, is a potent platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, which is also regarded as having neuroprotective effects in the CNS. The aim of this review is to summarise and to critically evaluate the current evidence on the CNS effects of EGb-761 and ginkgolide B, with particular emphasis on the data relating to their neuroprotective effects.","The neurotrophins are growth factors that play critical roles in the development, maintenance, survival, and death of the nervous system. The signal transducing systems that mediate the diverse biological functions of the neurotrophins are initiated by their interactions with two categories of cell surface receptors, the Trk family of tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). While the Trk receptors are responsible for most of the survival and growth properties of the neurotrophins, the actions of p75NTR fall into two categories. First, p75NTR is a Trk co-receptor that can enhance or suppress neurotrophin-mediated Trk receptor activity. Second, p75NTR autonomously activates signaling cascades that result in the induction of apoptosis or in the promotion of survival. The signaling cascades activated by p75NTR remain elusive, but structural and functional differences between p75NTR and other tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members suggest that p75NTR employs distinct signaling pathways. p75NTR has been shown to activate the NF-kappaB, Akt, and JNK pathways and interacts with several adaptor proteins. Of these, NRAGE, NADE, and NRIF have been associated with the induction of apoptosis, and FAP-1, RIP2, and TRAF6 appear to promote cellular survival. It remains a major challenge to link the various p75NTR binding proteins to specific p75NTR-dependent functions, but the identification of p75NTR interactors and signaling pathways has sparked new directions in p75NTR research, and will provide a better understanding of this enigmatic receptor.","Dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic nuclei form the trimonoamine modulating system (TMMS). This system modulates emotional/motivational activities mediated by the limbic circuitry, where glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Two main concepts are the basis of this review. First, since 1950 and the discovery of the antipsychotic activity of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist chlorpromazine, it appears that drugs that can modulate the TMMS possess therapeutic psychiatric properties. Second, the concept of glutamate/trimonoamine imbalance in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop that has been so successful in explaining the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease has been applied in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review will focus on the complex interactions between the fast synaptic glutamatergic transmission and the TMMS in specific parts of the limbic lobe and we will try to link these interactions to some psychiatric disorders, mainly depression, schizophrenia and drug addiction.","Pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) 1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), possess a wide range of biological actions in various tissues. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that these cytokines are involved in inflammatory reactions in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although many studies have demonstrated that IL-1, TNF, and their mRNA are up-regulated in the CNS after injury, the functional roles of these cytokines in the injury are far from completely understood. Overexpression of these cytokines, such as observed during the early stage of injury, can be harmful for the injured tissue. However, low levels of these cytokines, observed during the recovery stage after injury, can enhance repair processes of the injured tissues.","Neurotransmitter receptor systems have been the focus of intensive pharmacological research for more than 20 years for basic and applied scientific reasons, but only recently has there been a better understanding of their key features. One of these systems includes the type A receptor for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which forms an integral anion channel from a pentameric subunit assembly and mediates most of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult vertebrate central nervous system. Up to now, depending on the definition, 16-19 mammalian subunits have been cloned and localized on different genes. Their assembly into proteins in a poorly defined stoichiometry forms the basis of functional and pharmacological GABA(A) receptor diversity, i.e. the receptor subtypes. The latter has been well documented in autoradiographic studies using ligands that label some of the receptors' various binding sites, corroborated by recombinant expression studies using the same tools. Significantly less heterogeneity has been found at the physiological level in native receptors, where the subunit combinations have been difficult to dissect. This review focuses on the characteristics, use and usefulness of various ligands and their binding sites to probe GABA(A) receptor properties and to gain insight into the biological function from fish to man and into evolutionary conserved GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity. We also summarize the properties of the novel mouse models created for the study of various brain functions and review the state-of-the-art imaging of brain GABA(A) receptors in various human neuropsychiatric conditions. The data indicate that the present ligands are only partly satisfactory tools and further ligands with subtype-selective properties are needed for imaging purposes and for confirming the behavioral and functional results of the studies presently carried out in gene-targeted mice with other species, including man.","Language is constituted by discrete building blocks, sounds and words, which can be concatenated according to serial order principles. The neurobiological organization of these building blocks, in particular words, has been illuminated by recent metabolic and neurophysiological imaging studies. When humans process words of different kinds, various sets of cortical areas have been found to become active differentially. The old concept of two language centers processing all words alike must therefore be replaced by a model according to which words are organized as discrete distributed neuron ensembles that differ in their cortical topographies. The meaning of a word, more precisely, aspects of its reference, may be crucial for determining which set of cortical areas becomes involved in its processing. Whereas the serial order of sounds constituting a word may be established by serially aligned sets of neurons called synfire chains, different mechanisms are necessary for establishing word order in sentences. The serial order of words may be organized by higher-order neuronal sets, called sequence detectors here, which are being activated by sequential excitation of neuronal sets representing words. Sets of sequence detectors are proposed to process aspects of the syntactic information contained in a sentence. Other syntactic rules can be related to general features of the dynamics of cortical activation and deactivation. These postulates about the brain mechanisms of language, which are rooted in principles known from neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, may provide a framework for theory-driven neuroscientific research on language.","Dopamine (DA) acts as a key neurotransmitter in the brain. Numerous studies have shown its regulatory role for motor and limbic functions. However, in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), alterations of executive functions also suggest a role for DA in regulating cognitive functions. Some other diseases, which can also involve DA dysfunction, such as schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, as shown from the ameliorative action of dopaminergic antagonists and agonists, respectively, also show alteration of cognitive functions. Experimental studies showed that selective lesions of the dopaminergic neurons in rats or primates can actually provide cognitive deficits, especially when the mesocorticolimbic component of the dopaminergic systems is altered. Data from the experiments also showed significant alteration in attentional processes, thus raising the question of direct involvement of DA in regulating attention. Since the dopaminergic influence is mainly exerted over the frontal lobe and basal ganglia, it has been suggested that cognitive deficits express alteration in these subcortical brain structures closely linked to cortical areas, more than simple deficit in dopaminergic transmission. This point is still a matter of debate but, undoubtedly, DA acts as a powerful regulator of different aspects of cognitive brain functions. In this respect, normalizing DA transmission will contribute to improve the cognitive deficits not only related to neurologic or psychiatric diseases, but also in normal aging. Ontogenic and phylogenetic analysis of dopaminergic systems can provide evidences for a role of DA in the development of cognitive general capacities. DA can have a trophic action during maturation, which may influence the later cortical specification, particularly of pre-frontal cortical areas. Moreover, the characteristic extension of the dopaminergic cortical innervation in the rostro-caudal direction during the last stages of evolution in mammals can also be related to the appearance of progressively more developed cognitive capacities. Such an extension of cortical DA innervation could be related to increased processing of cortical information through basal ganglia, either during the course of evolution or development. DA has thus to be considered as a key neuroregulator which contributes to behavioral adaptation and to anticipatory processes necessary for preparing voluntary action consequent upon intention. All together, it can be suggested that a correlation exists between DA innervation and expression of cognitive capacities. Altering the dopaminergic transmission could, therefore, contribute to cognitive impairment.","Neuroscientific reflection on the integrative action of the nervous system was dominated by consideration of the motor system from the time of Aristotle in the 4th century B.C. to that of Sherrington, his contemporaries and proteges in the first-half of the 20th century. We describe the significant discoveries concerning the action of the spinal cord and cortex in motor phenomena during this period. This provides a vivid account of how great neuroscientists, over a period of more than 2000 years, have endeavoured to clarify notions concerning the integrative action of the nervous system in the context of the prevailing philosophical traditions of their times. We examine these traditions as well as the conceptual schemes offered by neuroscientists, especially in relation to the workings of the cortex. It is shown that neuroscientists cleave to this day to a tradition that goes back to Descartes, and that this is the case even for those who explicitly claim to reject such a tradition. The review concludes with what we take to be an appropriate basis for rejecting the Cartesian paradigm that we hope will assist neuroscientists in understanding the integrative action of the nervous system.","Upon receipt in the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord, nociceptive (pain-signalling) information from the viscera, skin and other organs is subject to extensive processing by a diversity of mechanisms, certain of which enhance, and certain of which inhibit, its transfer to higher centres. In this regard, a network of descending pathways projecting from cerebral structures to the DH plays a complex and crucial role. Specific centrifugal pathways either suppress (descending inhibition) or potentiate (descending facilitation) passage of nociceptive messages to the brain. Engagement of descending inhibition by the opioid analgesic, morphine, fulfils an important role in its pain-relieving properties, while induction of analgesia by the adrenergic agonist, clonidine, reflects actions at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (alpha(2)-ARs) in the DH normally recruited by descending pathways. However, opioids and adrenergic agents exploit but a tiny fraction of the vast panoply of mechanisms now known to be involved in the induction and/or expression of descending controls. For example, no drug interfering with descending facilitation is currently available for clinical use. The present review focuses on: (1) the organisation of descending pathways and their pathophysiological significance; (2) the role of individual transmitters and specific receptor types in the modulation and expression of mechanisms of descending inhibition and facilitation and (3) the advantages and limitations of established and innovative analgesic strategies which act by manipulation of descending controls. Knowledge of descending pathways has increased exponentially in recent years, so this is an opportune moment to survey their operation and therapeutic relevance to the improved management of pain.","In many cell types rises in cytosolic calcium, either due to influx from the extracellular space, or by release from an intracellular store activates calcium dependent potassium currents on the plasmalemma. In neurons, these currents are largely activated following calcium influx via voltage gated calcium channels active during the action potentials. Three types of these currents are known: I(c), I(AHP) and I(sAHP). These currents can be distinguished by clear differences in their pharmacology and kinetics. Activation of these potassium currents modulates action potential time course and the repetitive firing properties of neurons. Single channel studies have identified two types of calcium-activated potassium channel which can also be separated on biophysical and pharmacological grounds and have been named BK and SK channels. It is now clear that BK channels underlie I(c) whereas SK channels underlie I(AHP). The identity of the channels underlying I(sAHP) are not known. In this review, we discuss the properties of the different types of calcium-activated potassium channels and the relationship between these channels and the macroscopic currents present in neurons.","This review presents the remarkable advances that have been achieved in marijuana (cannabinoid) research, with the discovery of specific receptors and the existence of naturally occurring cannabis-like substances in the human body and brain. The last decade has seen more rapid progress in marijuana research than any time in the thousands of years that marijuana has been used by humans, particularly in cannabinoid genomics. The cDNA and genomic sequences encoding G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (Cnrs) from several species have now been cloned. Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids), synthetic and hydrolyzing enzymes and transporters that define neurochemically-specific cannabinoid brain pathways have been identified. Endocannabinoid lipid signaling molecules alter activity at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and possibly at anandamide-gated ion channels, such as vanilloid receptors. Availability of increasingly-specific CB1 and CB2 Cnr antagonists and of CB1 and CB2 Cnr knockout mice have increased our understanding of these cannabinoid systems and provides tantalizing evidence for even more G protein-coupled Cnrs. Initial studies of the Cnr gene structure, regulation and polymorphisms whet our appetite for more information about these interesting genes, their variants and roles in vulnerabilities to addictions and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Behavioral studies of cannabinoids document the complex interactions between rewarding and aversive effects of these drugs. Pursuing cannabinoid-related molecular, pharmacological and behavioral leads will add greatly to our understanding of endogenous brain neuromodulator systems, abused substances and potential therapeutics. This review of CB1 and CB2 Cnr genes in human and animal brain and their neurobiological effects provide a basis for many of these studies. Therefore, understanding the physiological cannabinoid control system in the human body and brain will contribute to elucidating this natural regulatory mechanism in health and disease.","The endogenous opioid system consists of three opioid peptide precursor genes encoding enkephalins (preproenkephalin, Penk), dynorphins (preprodynorphin, Pdyn) and beta-endorphin (betaend), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and three receptor genes encoding mu-opiod receptor (MOR), delta-opiod receptor (DOR) and kappa-opiod receptor (KOR). In the past years, all six genes have been inactivated in mice by homologous recombination. The analysis of spontaneous behavior in mutant mice has demonstrated significant and distinct roles of each gene in modulating locomotion, pain perception and emotional behaviors. The observation of opposing phenotypes of MOR- and DOR-deficient mice in several behaviors highlights unexpected roles for DOR to be further explored genetically and using more specific delta compounds. The analysis of responses of mutant mice to exogenous opiates has definitely clarified the essential role of MOR in both morphine analgesia and addiction, and demonstrated that DOR and KOR remain promising targets for pain treatment. These studies also show that prototypic DOR agonists partially require MOR for their biological activity and provide some support for the postulated mu-delta interactions in vivo. Finally, data confirm and define a role for several genes of the opioid system in responses to other drugs of abuse, and the triple opioid receptor knockout mutant allows exploring non-classical opioid pharmacology. In summary, the study of null mutant mice has extended our previous knowledge of the opioid system by identifying the molecular players in opioid pharmacology and physiology. Future studies should involve parallel behavioral analysis of mice lacking receptors and peptides and will benefit from more sophisticated gene targeting approaches, including site-directed and anatomically-restricted mutations.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the whole basal ganglia (BG). Various techniques have been used to study BG physiology and pathophysiology. Among these, extracellular single unit recording remains of particular importance. An impressive number of studies of BG electrophysiological activity have been carried out, both in non-human and in human primates, but the data collected show many omissions and disparities. BG activity has been well defined in the physiological situation, but remains far from clear in the Parkinsonian and virtually unexplored in the dopamine (DA)-replacement situation. This paper provides a brief synopsis of (i) recording techniques and (ii) BG electrophysiological activity in normal, Parkinsonian, and dopamine-replacement situations. We have restricted the data used to those obtained in BG structures of human and non-human primates. Only single unit recordings have been reported and four electrophysiological characteristics retained: mean firing frequency, firing pattern, periodic oscillation, and response to both passive and active movement. We have attempted to summarize (i) the commonly accepted characteristics of each BG structure in the three situations, (ii) discrepancies that exist, and (iii) missing elements. Then, the main successive theories aimed to explain the role played by BG in motor control are presented and discussed in the light of the most recently obtained results using the latest technological advances.","Stimulation of membrane receptors linked to a phospholipase C and the subsequent production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) is a signaling pathway of fundamental importance in eukaryotic cells. Signaling downstream of these initial steps involves mobilization of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane. For this influx, several contrasting mechanisms may be responsible but particular relevance is attributed to the induction of Ca(2+) influx as consequence of depletion of intracellular calcium stores. This phenomenon (frequently named store-operated calcium entry, SOCE), in turn, may be brought about by various signals, including soluble cytosolic factors, interaction of proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum with ion channels in the plasma membrane, and a secretion-like coupling involving translocation of channels to the plasma membrane. Experimental approaches to analyze these mechanisms have been considerably advanced by the discovery of mammalian homologs of the Drosophila cation channel transient receptor potential (TRP). Some members of the TRP family can be expressed to Ca(2+)-permeable channels that enable SOCE; other members form channels activated independently of stores. TRP proteins may be an essential part of endogenous Ca(2+) entry channels but so far expression of most TRP cDNAs has not resulted in restitution of channels found in any mammalian cells, suggesting the requirement for further unknown subunits. A major exception is CaT1, a TRP channel demonstrated to provide Ca(2+)-selective, store-operated currents identical to those characterized in several cell types. Ongoing and future research on TRP channels will be crucial to understand the molecular basis of receptor-mediated Ca(2+) entry, with respect to the structure of the entry channels as well as to the mechanisms of its activation and regulation.","When an object appears in the visual field, animals orient their head, eyes, and body toward it in a well-coordinated manner (orienting movement). The head movement is a major portion of the orienting movement. Interest in the neural control of head movements in the monkey and human have increased in the 1990's, however, fundamental knowledge about the neural circuits controlling the orienting head movement continues to be based on a large number of experimental studies performed in the cat. Thus, it is crucial now to summarize information that has been clarified in the cat for further advancement in understanding the neural control of head movements in different animal species. The superior colliculus (SC) has been identified as the primary brainstem center controlling the orienting. Its output signal is transmitted to neck motoneurons via two major separate pathways: one through the reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) in the pons and medulla and the other through neurons in Forel's field H (FFH) in the mesodiencephalic junction. The tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway controls orienting chiefly in the horizontal direction, while the tecto-FFH-spinal pathway controls orienting in the vertical direction. In each pathway, a subgroup of neurons functions as premotor neurons for both extraocular and neck motoneurons, while others are specified for each, which allows both coordinated and separate control of eye and head movements. Head movements almost always produce shifts in the center of gravity that might cause postural disturbances. The postural equilibrium may be maintained by transmitting the orienting command to the limb segments via descending axons of the reticulospinal and long propriospinal neurons. The SC and brainstem relay neurons receive descending inputs from higher order structures such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These inputs may serve context-dependent control of orienting by modulating the activities of the primary brainstem pathways.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent dementia characterized by progressive loss of cognitive functions and by characteristic pathological changes in the brain: the formation of aggregates extracellularly by beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and intracellularly by tau proteins. The disease presents several major diagnostic difficulties: (1) AD develops slowly; (2) analysis of damaged brain tissues is difficult, requiring a biopsy which poses ethical problems; (3) no biochemical markers are available for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease progression. Since the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in contact with the extracellular space of the brain, many studies have tried to correlate the levels of the intrathecal peptides and amino acids and the development of dementia. The present review analyzes the main results of intrathecal content analyses in light of pathogenic theories proposed to explain the damage associated with AD and observed in the brain of patients by postmortem examination.","The term neuropeptides commonly refers to a relatively large number of biologically active molecules that have been localized to discrete cell populations of central and peripheral neurons. I review here the most important histological and functional findings on neuropeptide distribution in the central nervous system (CNS), in relation to their role in the exchange of information between the nerve cells. Under this perspective, peptide costorage (presence of two or more peptides within the same subcellular compartment) and coexistence (concurrent presence of peptides and other messenger molecules within single nerve cells) are discussed in detail. In particular, the subcellular site(s) of storage and sorting mechanisms within neurons are thoroughly examined in the view of the mode of release and action of neuropeptides as neuronal messengers. Moreover, the relationship of neuropeptides and other molecules implicated in neural transmission is discussed in functional terms, also referring to the interactions with novel unconventional transmitters and trophic factors. Finally, a brief account is given on the presence of neuropeptides in glial cells.","Taste buds are sensory end organs that detect chemical substances occurring in foodstuffs and relay the relative information to the brain. The mechanisms by which the chemical stimuli are converted into biological signals represent a central issue in taste research. Our understanding of how taste buds accomplish this operation relies on the detailed knowledge of the biological properties of taste bud cells-the taste cells-and of the functional processes occurring in these cells during chemostimulation. The amphibian Necturus maculosus (mudpuppy) has proven to be a very useful model for studying basic cellular processes of vertebrate taste reception, some of which are still awaiting to be explored in mammals. The main advantages offered by Necturus are the large size of its taste cells and the relative accessibility of its taste buds, which can therefore be handled easily for experimental manipulations. In this review, I summarize the functional properties of Necturus taste cells studied with electrophysiological techniques (intracellular recordings and patch-clamp recordings). My focus is on ion channels in taste cells and on their role in signal transduction, as well as on the functional relationships among the cells inside Necturus taste buds. This information has revealed to be well suited to outline some of the general physiological processes occurring during taste reception in vertebrates, including mammals, and may represent a useful framework for understanding how taste buds work.","In recent years, functional imaging techniques, like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have shown that the improvement of motor and language function after ischemic stroke is accompanied by extensive reorganizational changes in the human cortex. To better understand these changes and to judge to what extent they could be responsible for clinical improvement, some basic principles of the organization of the motor and language system are discussed.Non-invasive functional imaging can have only a limited contribution in determining which of the possible underlying neural mechanisms, as they are known from animal experiments, play a role in functional recovery. However, they make it possible to define the functional consequences of anatomical lesions in individual patients and to correlate these functional consequences in the motor and language system with the clinical deficit. They can be used to assess the influence on the cortical reorganization of established and newer physiotherapies, logopedics and medical intervention, and they could be a useful tool in determining prognosis.","The endogenous pain control system has long been considered as engaged in pain depression through the commitment of multiple descending actions that reduce the response capacity of spinal dorsal horn nociceptive neurones. Such a pure inhibitory antinociceptive nature was lately questioned by the observation of pronociceptive effects from areas classically regarded as antinociceptive. The thereby raised hypothesis of a more versatile functional arrangement that dynamically adjusts the pain modulatory effect to multiple conditions by balancing several excitatory and inhibitory actions found strong support on the recent discovery of a medullary area particularly dedicated to pain facilitation. Lesioning the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt) depresses nociceptive responses to acute and inflammatory pain, whereas stimulation produces the inverse effect. The decrease in formalin-induced pain behaviour following DRt lesioning is accompanied by a decrease of spinal noxious-evoked c-fos neuronal activation. DRt blocking by lidocaine results in a decrease of the nociceptive activity of spinal dorsal horn neurones, whereas stimulation by glutamate has the opposite effect. A reciprocal disynaptic putative excitatory circuit that links the DRt and the spinal dorsal horn and conveys nociceptive input through the ascending branch was described, indicating that the DRt pain facilitating action is mediated by a reverberating spino-DRt circuit that promotes the enhancement of the response capacity of spinal neurones to noxious stimulation.The demonstration of a primary pronociceptive centre in the endogenous pain control system brings new important data to the emerging concept of pain modulation as a dynamic and flexible process that integrates nociceptive processing by balancing multiple excitatory and inhibitory actions as the way of adapting to the various unsteady pain determinants.","Sequestration of G protein-coupled receptors from the cell surface is a commonly observed phenomenon following agonist-stimulation. This process is now believed to be important for receptor resensitization as well as for signal transduction. Over the years, numerous studies have aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying internalization. Proteins such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and the beta-arrestins, which were initially characterized as desensitizing molecules, have been shown to be important regulators of the endocytic process. Recently, numerous interacting partners have been identified for each of these two classes of proteins. However, the details regarding the sequence of these interactions and the cross-talk between signaling pathways containing the different protein complexes are just beginning to be uncovered. In this review, we summarize these findings and discuss the role of GRKs and beta-arrestins, two families of key regulatory proteins that regulate G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis.","A characteristic peculiarity of the trigeminal sensory system is the presence of two distinct populations of primary afferent neurons. Most of their cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) but part of them lie in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN). This review compares the neurochemical content of central versus peripheral trigeminal primary afferent neurons. In the TG, two subpopulations of primary sensory neurons, containing immunoreactive (IR) material, are identified: a number of glutamate (Glu)-, substance P (SP)-, neurokinin A (NKA)-, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-, cholecystokinin (CCK)-, somatostatin (SOM)-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and galanin (GAL)-IR ganglion cells with small and medium-sized somata, and relatively less numerous larger-sized neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and peptide 19 (PEP 19)-IR trigeminal neurons. In addition, many nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- and parvalbumin (PV)-IR cells of all sizes as well as fewer, mostly large, calbindin D-28k (CB)-containing neurons are seen. The majority of the large ganglion cells are surrounded by SP-, CGRP-, SOM-, CCK-, VIP-, NOS- and serotonin (SER)-IR perisomatic networks. In the MTN, the main subpopulation of large-sized neurons display Glu-immunoreactivity. Additionally, numerous large MTN neurons exhibit PV- and CB-immunostaining. On the other hand, certain small MTN neurons, most likely interneurons, are found to be GABAergic. Furthermore, NOS-containing neurons can be detected in the caudal and the mesencephalic-pontine junction portions of the nucleus. Conversely, no immunoreactivity to any of the examined neuropeptides is observed in the cell bodies of MTN neurons but these are encircled by peptidergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and nitrergic perineuronal arborizations in a basket-like manner. Such a discrepancy in the neurochemical features suggests that the differently fated embryonic migration, synaptogenesis, and peripheral and central target field innervation can possibly affect the individual neurochemical phenotypes of trigeminal primary afferent neurons.","Normal CNS development involves the sequential differentiation of multipotent stem cells. Alteration of the numbers of stem cells, their self-renewal ability, or their proliferative capacity will have major effects on the appropriate development of the nervous system. In this review, we discuss different mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell differentiation. Proliferation signals and cell cycle regulators may regulate cell kinetics or total number of cell divisions. Loss of trophic support and cytokine receptor activation may differentially contribute to the induction of cell death at specific stages of development. Signaling from differentiated progeny or asymmetric distribution of specific molecules may alter the self-renewal characteristics of stem cells. We conclude that the final decision of a cell to self-renew, differentiate or remain quiescent is dependent on an integration of multiple signaling pathways and at each instant will depend on cell density, metabolic state, ligand availability, type and levels of receptor expression, and downstream cross-talk between distinct signaling pathways.","During development of the nervous system, neurons extend axons over considerable distances in a highly stereospecific fashion in order to innervate their targets in an appropriate manner. This involves the recognition, by the axonal growth cone, of guidance cues that determine the pathway taken by the axons. These guidance cues can act to promote and/or repel growth cone advance, and they can act either locally or at a distance from their place of synthesis. The directed growth of axons is partly governed by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the neuronal growth cone that bind to CAMs on the surface of other axons or non-neuronal cells. In vitro assays have established the importance of the CAMs (N-CAM, N-cadherin and the L1 glycoprotein) in promoting axonal growth over cells, such as Schwann cells, astrocytes and muscle cells. Strong evidence now exists implicating the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase as the primary signal transduction molecule in the CAM pathway. Cell adhesion molecules are important constituents of synapses, and CAMs appear to play important and diverse roles in regulating synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory. Negative extracellular signals which physically direct neurite growth have also been described. The latter include the neuronal growth inhibitory proteins Nogo and myelin-associated glycoprotein, as well as the growth cone collapsing Semaphorins/neuropilins. Although less well characterised, evidence is now beginning to emerge describing a role for Rho kinase-mediated signalling in inhibition of neurite outgrowth. This review focuses on some of the major themes and ideas associated with this fast-moving field of neuroscience.","To what extent is the variability of the neuronal responses compatible with the use of spike timing for sensory information processing by the central nervous system? In reviewing the state of the art of this question, I first analyze the characteristics of this variability with its three elements: synaptic noise, impact of ongoing activity and possible fluctuations in evoked responses. I then review the recent literature on the various sensory modalities: somato-sensory, olfactory, gustatory and visual and auditory processing. I emphasize that the conditions in which precise timing, at the millisecond level, is usually obtained, are conditions that usually require dynamic stimulation or sharp changes in the stimuli. By contrast, situations in which stimulation not belonging to the temporal domain is temporally encoded lead to much coarser temporal coding; although in both cases, neural networks transmit the signals with similarly high precision. Synchronization among neurons is an important tool in information processing in both cases but again seems to act either at millisecond or tens of millisecond levels. Information theory applied to both situations confirms that the average rate of information transmission is much higher in dynamic than in static situations. These facts suggest that channels of precise temporal encoding may exist in the brain but imply populations of neurons working in a yet to be discovered way.","Neuroscientists, in the last half of the 20th century, provided major insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with seeing and remembering. We first identify some of the most important of these discoveries. This is done along lines familiar to neuroscientists who have read many of the recent books and reviews that provide an overview of neuroscientific discoveries. In general, these emphasize the scientific contributions this discipline has made to our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to the psychological attributes of humans and other animals. In the next sections, we examine the claims made in these overviews; in particular, those by the standard-bearers of neuroscience, in an attempt to clarify what can and what cannot be justified in these claims. This requires a conceptual analysis of a kind that is unfamiliar to most neuroscientists. Our analysis begins with consideration of the conceptual confusions that ensue when neuroscientists attribute seeing, remembering and other psychological attributes to the brain rather than to the creature whose brain it is. Subsequently, we outline what we take to be the appropriate conceptual scheme for neuroscientists to adopt.","Immune activity in general, and autoimmunity in particular, have long been considered as harmful in the context of central nervous system (CNS) trauma. Increasing evidence suggests, however, that the injured CNS can benefit from autoimmune manipulations. Active or passive immunization with CNS-associated self antigens was shown to promote recovery from a CNS insult. It is now also evident that this beneficial 'autoimmunity' is not solely an outcome of immune manipulation but is also a physiological response, evoked by a non-pathogenic insult and apparently designed to counteract the insult-related toxicity which is induced in part by essential physiological compounds present in excess of their normal levels. It appears that when the buffering capacity of constitutive local mechanisms (transporters, enzymes, etc.) that normally regulate these compounds is exceeded, assistance is recruited from the immune system. Like the overactive physiological compounds themselves, the immune system needs to be rigorously regulated in order to produce adequate phagocytic activity and the required quantity of cytokines and growth factors at the right time and place. Boosting of this autoimmune response is potentially a powerful strategy for neuroprotective therapy.","The optic tectum differentiates from the alar plate of the mesencephalon and receives retinal fibres in a precise retinotopic manner. Here, mechanisms of tectum polarisation and regionalisation are reviewed. Misexpression of Pax2, Pax5 or En can change the fate of the presumptive diencephalon to that of the tectum. Ephrin A2 and A5 are expressed in a gradient in the tectum, caudal high and rostral low, and may play important roles in the formation of a precise retinotectal projection map. Retinal fibres that express receptors for these ligands, and which come from the temporal retina, are repulsed by the ligands and do not invade the caudal tectum. Both En1 and En2 can regulate posterior characteristics in the tectum by inducing ephrin A2 and A5. Transplantation experiments in chick have indicated that the mes/metencephalic boundary works as an organiser for the tectum and the cerebellum. Fgf8 is a candidate signalling molecule in the organiser. Pax2/5, En, and Fgf8 are in a positive feedback loop for their expression such that misexpression of one of these genes in the diencephalon turns on the feedback loop and can result in induction of an optic tectum. Otx2 and Gbx2 appear to repress each other's expression and contribute to defining the posterior border of the tectum. Misexpression of Otx2 in the metencephalon can change the fate of its alar plate to a tectum, and misexpression of Gbx2 in the mesencephalon can cause anterior shifting of the caudal limit of the tectum. The anterior border of the tectum may be determined as a result of repressive interactions between Pax6 and En1/Pax2. Along the dorsoventral axis of the mesencephalon, Shh contributes to ventralize the tissue; that is, Shh can change the fate of the presumptive tectum to that of the tegmentum that is the ventral structure. It is proposed that the brain vesicle that expresses Otx2, Pax2, and En1 may differentiate into the tectum.","Scientists have spent hundreds of years trying to understand how the brain controls movement. Why has there been so little interest in knowing how the brain STOPS movement? This review calls attention to behavioral phenomena in which an animal or human undergoes temporary total-body arrest of movement, that is, behavioral arrest (BA). These states can be actively induced by visual stimuli, by body and limb manipulations, and by drugs. Historically, these states have been considered as unrelated, and their literature does not cross-connect. What is known about the causal mechanisms is scant, limited mostly to implication of the brainstem in manipulation-induced BA and dopaminergic blockade in the striatum in the case of drug-induced BA. The possibility has not been experimentally tested that all of these states share with each other not only an active global immobility in which awkward postures are maintained, but also underlying neural mechanisms. This review identifies key brainstem, diencephalic, and basal forebrain areas that seem to be involved in causing BA. We review the evidence that suggest a possible role in BA for the following brain structures: entopeduncular nucleus, medullary and pontine reticular zones, parabrachial region, pedunculopontine nucleus and nearby areas, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. Such areas may operate as a BA control system. Confirmation of which brain areas operate collectively in BA would require testing of several kinds of BA in the same animals with the same kinds of experimental tests. Areas and mechanisms might be elucidated through a strategic combination of the following research approaches: imaging (fMRI, c-fos), lesions (of areas, of afferent and efferent pathways), chemical microstimulation, and electrical recording (of multiple units and field potentials, with an emphasis on testing coherence among areas). We suggest the working hypothesis that BA is created and sustained by coherent, perhaps oscillatory, activity among a group of basal forebrain and brainstem areas that collectively disrupt the normal spinal and supraspinal sequencing controls of reciprocal actions on the extensors and flexors that otherwise produce movement.","Retrospective studies in humans suggest that chronic maternal stress during pregnancy, associated with raised plasma levels of CRH, ACTH and cortisol may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, developmental delays and behavioural abnormalities in the children. In adulthood, it may contribute to the significant association between the incidence of schizophrenia, increased left or mixed handedness, reduction in cerebral asymmetry and anomalies in brain morphology. Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic these developmental and behavioural alterations. These rats show a reduced propensity for social interaction, increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations and a reduction in cerebral asymmetry and dopamine turnover, consistent with those in schizophrenic humans. Prenatally-stressed (PS) rats also show behaviour consistent with depression, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, a hedonic deficit and greater acquisition of learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. These behavioural abnormalities are associated with impaired regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased CRH activity. PS males may show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in PS offspring could occur through sensitisation of the foetal brain by maternal stress hormones to the action of glucocorticoid and CRH and to neurotransmitters affected by them. This may have long-lasting consequences and could explain the precipitation of depressive symptoms or schizophrenia by psychosocial stress in later life. The character of the behavioural abnormalities probably depends on the timing of the maternal stress in relation to development of the particular neuronal systems.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol 2001 Dec;65(5):497.,"Complementing the classical concept of genomic steroid actions, here we (i) review evidence showing that important neural effects of glucocorticoids are exerted by non-genomic mechanisms; (ii) describe known mechanisms that may underlie such effects; (iii) summarize the functions and implications of non-genomic mechanisms and (iv) outline future directions of research. The role of non-genomic mechanisms is to shape the response of the organism to challenges that require a substantial reorganization of neural and somatic functions and involve massive behavioral shifts. Non-genomic effects may (i) prepare the cell for subsequent glucocorticoid-induced genomic changes, (ii) bridge the gap between the early need of change and the delay in the expression of genomic effects and (iii) may induce specific changes that in some instances are opposite to those induced by genomic mechanisms. The latter can be explained by the fact that challenging situations require different responses in early (acute) and later (chronic) phases. Data show that non-genomic mechanisms of glucocorticoid action play a role in both pathological phenomena and the expression of ameliorative pharmacological effects. Non-genomic mechanisms that underlie many glucocorticoid-induced neural changes constitute a for long overlooked controlling factor. Despite the multitude and the variety of accumulated data, important questions remain to be answered.","The aims of this paper are to provide a comprehensive and up to date review of the mechanisms of induction and expression of long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. The review will focus largely on homosynaptic LTD and other forms of LTD will be considered only where appropriate for a fuller understanding of LTD mechanisms. We shall concentrate on what are felt to be some of the most interesting recent findings concerning LTD in the central nervous system. Wherever possible we shall try to consider some of the disparities in results and possible reasons for these. Finally, we shall briefly consider some of the possible functional consequences of LTD for normal physiological function.",,"Tissue-specific alternative splicing profoundly effects animal physiology, development and disease, and this is nowhere more evident than in the nervous system. Alternative splicing is a versatile form of genetic control whereby a common pre-mRNA is processed into multiple mRNA isoforms differing in their precise combination of exon sequences. In the nervous system, thousands of alternatively spliced mRNAs are translated into their protein counterparts where specific isoforms play roles in learning and memory, neuronal cell recognition, neurotransmission, ion channel function, and receptor specificity. The essential nature of this process is underscored by the finding that its misregulation is a common characteristic of human disease. This review highlights the current views of the biological phenomenon of alternative splicing, and describes evidence for its intricate underlying biochemical mechanisms. The roles of RNA binding proteins and their tissue-specific properties are discussed. Why does alternative splicing occur in cosmic proportions in the nervous system? How does it affect integrated cellular functions? How are region-specific, cell-specific and developmental differences in splicing directed? How are the control mechanisms that operate in the nervous system distinct from those of other tissues? Although there are many unanswered questions, substantial progress has been made in showing that alternative splicing is of major importance in generating proteomic diversity, and in modulating protein activities in a temporal and spatial manner. The relevance of alternative splicing to diseases of the nervous system is also discussed.","Although there were several premonitory signs of a sleep stage with dreaming, it was only in 1953 that such a stage was identified with certainty. This paper analyses the observations and research related to this dreaming stage (rapid eye movement sleep) until 1964. During these 11 years of research, the main psychological and physiological characteristics of this sleep stage were first described. Where the few results or discussions were later questioned, today's current state of knowledge is briefly outlined.","A variety of neurotransmitters and other chemical substances are released into the extracellular space in the brain in response to acute ischemic stress, and the biological actions of these substances are exclusively mediated by receptor-linked second messenger systems. One of the well-known second messenger systems is adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the generation of cyclic AMP, triggering the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA controls a number of cellular functions by phosphorylating many substrates, including an important DNA-binding transcription factor, cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). CREB has recently been shown to play an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions, including synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection against various insults, and to constitute a convergence point for many signaling cascades. The autoradiographic method developed in our laboratory enables us to simultaneously quantify alterations of the second messenger system and local cerebral blood flow (lCBF). Adenylate cyclase is diffusely activated in the initial phase of acute ischemia (< or = 30 min), and its activity gradually decreases in the late phase of ischemia (2-6 h). The areas of reduced adenylate cyclase activity strictly coincide with infarct areas, which later become visible. The binding activity of PKA to cyclic AMP, which reflects the functional integrity of the enzyme, is rapidly suppressed during the initial phase of ischemia in the ischemic core, especially in vulnerable regions, such as the CA1 of the hippocampus, and it continues to decline. By contrast, PKA binding activity remains enhanced in the peri-ischemia area. These changes occur in a clearly lCBF-dependent manner. CREB phosphorylation at a serine residue, Ser(133), which suggests the activation of CREB-mediated transcription of genes containing a CRE motif in the nuclei, remains enhanced in the peri-ischemia area, which is spared of infarct damage. On the other hand, CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 rapidly diminishes in the ischemic core before the histological damage becomes manifest. The Ca2+ influx during membrane depolarization contributes to CREB phosphorylation in the initial phase of post-ischemic recirculation, while PKA activation and other signaling elements seem to be responsible in the later phase. These findings suggest that derangement of cyclic AMP-related intracellular signal transduction closely parallels ischemic neuronal damage and that persistent enhancement of this signaling pathway is important for neuronal survival in acute cerebral ischemia.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a preferential loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the etiology of PD is unknown, major biochemical processes such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial inhibition are largely described. However, despite these findings, the actual therapeutics are essentially symptomatical and are not able to block the degenerative process. Recent histological studies performed on brains from PD patients suggest that nigral cell death could be apoptotic. However, since post-mortem studies do not allow precise determination of the sequence of events leading to this apoptotic cell death, the molecular pathways involved in this process have been essentially studied on experimental models reproducing the human disease. These latter are created by using neurotoxic compounds such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or dopamine (DA). Extensive study of these models have shown that they mimick, in vitro and in vivo, the histological and/or the biochemical characteristics of PD and thus help to define important cellular actors of cell death presumably critical for the nigral degeneration. This review reports recent data concerning the biochemical and molecular apoptotic mechanisms underlying the experimental models of PD and correlates them to the phenomena occurring in human disease.","P2X receptors are a family of ligand-gated ion channels, activated by extracellular ATP. The seven subunits cloned (P2X1-7) can assemble to form homomeric and heteromeric receptors. Peripheral neurons of neural crest origin (e.g. those in dorsal root, trigeminal, sympathetic and enteric ganglia) and placodal origin (e.g. those in nodose and petrosal ganglia) express mRNAs for multiple P2X subunits. In this review, we summarize the molecular biological, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical evidence for P2X receptor subunits in sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, pelvic and myenteric neurons and adrenomedullary chromaffin cells. We consider the pharmacological properties of these native P2X receptors and their physiological roles. The responses of peripheral neurons to ATP show considerable heterogeneity between cells in the same ganglia, between ganglia and between species. Nevertheless, these responses can all be accounted for by the presence of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits, giving rise to varying proportions of homomeric and heteromeric receptors. While dorsal root ganglion neurons express predominantly P2X3 and rat sympathetic neurons express mainly P2X2 receptors, nodose and guinea-pig sympathetic neurons express mixed populations of P2X2 and heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors. P2X receptors are important for synaptic transmission in enteric ganglia, although their roles in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are less clear. Their presence on sensory neurons is essential for some processes including detection of filling of the urinary bladder. The regulation of P2X receptor expression in development and in pathological conditions, along with the interactions between purinergic and other signalling systems, may reveal further physiological roles for P2X receptors in autonomic and sensory ganglia.","Brain tissue has a remarkable ability to accumulate glutamate. This ability is due to glutamate transporter proteins present in the plasma membranes of both glial cells and neurons. The transporter proteins represent the only (significant) mechanism for removal of glutamate from the extracellular fluid and their importance for the long-term maintenance of low and non-toxic concentrations of glutamate is now well documented. In addition to this simple, but essential glutamate removal role, the glutamate transporters appear to have more sophisticated functions in the modulation of neurotransmission. They may modify the time course of synaptic events, the extent and pattern of activation and desensitization of receptors outside the synaptic cleft and at neighboring synapses (intersynaptic cross-talk). Further, the glutamate transporters provide glutamate for synthesis of e.g. GABA, glutathione and protein, and for energy production. They also play roles in peripheral organs and tissues (e.g. bone, heart, intestine, kidneys, pancreas and placenta). Glutamate uptake appears to be modulated on virtually all possible levels, i.e. DNA transcription, mRNA splicing and degradation, protein synthesis and targeting, and actual amino acid transport activity and associated ion channel activities. A variety of soluble compounds (e.g. glutamate, cytokines and growth factors) influence glutamate transporter expression and activities. Neither the normal functioning of glutamatergic synapses nor the pathogenesis of major neurological diseases (e.g. cerebral ischemia, hypoglycemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and schizophrenia) as well as non-neurological diseases (e.g. osteoporosis) can be properly understood unless more is learned about these transporter proteins. Like glutamate itself, glutamate transporters are somehow involved in almost all aspects of normal and abnormal brain activity.","Single or double-level compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots located in the dural sac results in a polyradicular symptomatology clinically diagnosed as cauda equina syndrome. The cauda equina nerve roots provide the sensory and motor innervation of most of the lower extremities, the pelvic floor and the sphincters. Therefore, in a fully developed cauda equina syndrome, multiple signs of sensory disorders may appear. These disorders include low-back pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral sciatica, then motor weakness of the lower extremities or chronic paraplegia and, bladder dysfunction. Multiple etiologies can cause the cauda equina syndrome. Among them, non-neoplastic compressive etiologies such as herniated lumbosacral discs and spinal stenosis and spinal neoplasms play a significant role in the development of the cauda equina syndrome. Non-compressive etiologies of the cauda equina syndrome include ischemic insults, inflammatory conditions, spinal arachnoiditis and other infectious etiologies. The use of canine, porcine and rat models mimicking the cauda equina syndrome enabled discovery of the effects of the compression on nerve root neural and vascular anatomy, the impairment of impulse propagation and the changes of the neurotransmitters in the spinal cord after compression of cauda equina. The involvement of intrinsic spinal cord neurons in the compression-induced cauda equina syndrome includes anterograde, retrograde and transneuronal degeneration in the lumbosacral segments. Prominent changes of NADPH diaphorase exhibiting, Fos-like immunoreactive and heat shock protein HSP72 were detected in the lumbosacral segments in a short-and long-lasting compression of the cauda equina in the dog. Developments in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with back pain, sciatica and with a herniated lumbar disc are mentioned, including many treatment options available.","The aging of the central nervous system and the development of incapacitating neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) are generally associated with a wide range of histological and pathophysiological changes eventually leading to a compromised cognitive status. Although the diverse triggers of the neurodegenerative processes and their interactions are still the topic of extensive debate, the possible contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies has been vigorously promoted in recent years. Various forms of cerebrovascular insufficiency such as reduced blood supply to the brain or disrupted microvascular integrity in cortical regions may occupy an initiating or intermediate position in the chain of events ending with cognitive failure. When, for example, vasoconstriction takes over a dominating role in the cerebral vessels, the perfusion rate of the brain can considerably decrease causing directly or through structural vascular damage a drop in cerebral glucose utilization. Consequently, cerebral metabolism can suffer a setback leading to neuronal damage and a concomitant suboptimal cognitive capacity. The present review focuses on the microvascular aspects of neurodegenerative processes in aging and AD with special attention to cerebral blood flow, neural metabolic changes and the abnormalities in microvascular ultrastructure. In this context, a few of the specific triggers leading to the prominent cerebrovascular pathology, as well as the potential neurological outcome of the compromised cerebral microvascular system are also going to be touched upon to a certain extent, without aiming at total comprehensiveness. Finally, a set of animal models are going to be presented that are frequently used to uncover the functional relationship between cerebrovascular factors and the damage to neural networks.","Research on Blindsight, Neglect/Extinction and Phantom limb syndromes, as well as electrical measurements of mammalian brain activity, have suggested the dependence of vivid perception on both incoming sensory information at primary sensory cortex and reentrant information from associative cortex. Coherence between incoming and reentrant signals seems to be a necessary condition for (conscious) perception. General reticular activating system and local electrical synchronization are some of the tools used by the brain to establish coarse coherence at the sensory cortex, upon which biochemical processes are coordinated. Besides electrical synchrony and chemical modulation at the synapse, a central mechanism supporting such a coherence is the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel, working as a 'coincidence detector' for an incoming signal causing the depolarization necessary to remove Mg(2+), and reentrant information releasing the glutamate that finally prompts Ca(2+) entry. We propose that a signal transduction pathway activated by Ca(2+) entry into cortical neurons is in charge of triggering a quantum computational process that accelerates inter-neuronal communication, thus solving systemic conflict and supporting the unity of consciousness.","The analysis of cellular-molecular events mediating synaptic plasticity within vestibular nuclei is an attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying vestibular plasticity phenomena. The present review is meant to illustrate the main results, obtained in vitro, on the mechanisms underlying long-term changes in synaptic strength within the medial vestibular nuclei. The synaptic plasticity phenomena taking place at the level of vestibular nuclei could be useful for adapting and consolidating the efficacy of vestibular neuron responsiveness to environmental requirements, as during visuo-vestibular recalibration and vestibular compensation. Following a general introduction on the most salient features of vestibular compensation and visuo-vestibular adaptation, which are two plastic events involving neuronal circuitry within the medial vestibular nuclei, the second and third sections describe the results from rat brainstem slice studies, demonstrating the possibility to induce long-term potentiation and depression in the medial vestibular nuclei, following high frequency stimulation of the primary vestibular afferents. In particular the mechanisms sustaining the induction and expression of vestibular long-term potentiation and depression, such as the role of various glutamate receptors and retrograde messengers have been described. The relevant role of the interaction between the platelet-activating factor, acting as a retrograde messenger, and the presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors, in determining the full expression of vestibular long-term potentiation is also underlined. In addition, the mechanisms involved in vestibular long-term potentiation have been compared with those leading to long-term potentiation in the hippocampus to emphasize the most significant differences emerging from vestibular studies. The fourth part, describes recent results demonstrating the essential role of nitric oxide, another retrograde messenger, in the induction of vestibular potentiation. Finally the fifth part suggests the possible functional significance of different action times of the two retrograde messengers and metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are involved in mediating the presynaptic mechanism sustaining vestibular long-term potentiation.","Insects are favoured objects for studying information processing in restricted neuronal networks, e.g. motor pattern generation or sensory perception. The analysis of the underlying processes requires knowledge of the electrical properties of the cells involved. These properties are determined by the expression pattern of ionic channels and by the regulation of their function, e.g. by neuromodulators. We here review the presently available knowledge on insect non-synaptic ion channels and ionic currents in neurons and skeletal muscles. The first part of this article covers genetic and structural informations, the localization of channels, their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, and known effects of second messengers and modulators such as neuropeptides or biogenic amines. In a second part we describe in detail modulation of ionic currents in three particularly well investigated preparations, i.e. Drosophila photoreceptor, cockroach DUM (dorsal unpaired median) neuron and locust jumping muscle. Ion channel structures are almost exclusively known for the fruitfly Drosophila, and most of the information on their function has also been obtained in this animal, mainly based on mutational analysis and investigation of heterologously expressed channels. Now the entire genome of Drosophila has been sequenced, it seems almost completely known which types of channel genes--and how many of them--exist in this animal. There is much knowledge of the various types of channels formed by 6-transmembrane--spanning segments (6TM channels) including those where four 6TM domains are joined within one large protein (e.g. classical Na+ channel). In comparison, two TM channels and 4TM (or tandem) channels so far have hardly been explored. There are, however, various well characterized ionic conductances, e.g. for Ca2+, Cl- or K+, in other insect preparations for which the channels are not yet known. In some of the larger insects, i.e. bee, cockroach, locust and moth, rather detailed information has been established on the role of ionic currents in certain physiological or behavioural contexts. On the whole, however, knowledge of non-synaptic ion channels in such insects is still fragmentary. Modulation of ion currents usually involves activation of more or less elaborate signal transduction cascades. The three detailed examples for modulation presented in the second part indicate, amongst other things, that one type of modulator usually leads to concerted changes of several ion currents and that the effects of different modulators in one type of cell may overlap. Modulators participate in the adaptive changes of the various cells responsible for different physiological or behavioural states. Further study of their effects on the single cell level should help to understand how small sets of cells cooperate in order to produce the appropriate output.","Reliable transmission of activity from nerve to muscle is necessary for the normal function of the body. The term 'safety factor' refers to the ability of neuromuscular transmission to remain effective under various physiological conditions and stresses. This is a result of the amount of transmitter released per nerve impulse being greater than that required to trigger an action potential in the muscle fibre. The safety factor is a measure of this excess of released transmitter. In this review we discuss the practical difficulties involved in estimating the safety factor in vitro. We then consider the factors that influence the safety factor in vivo. While presynaptic transmitter release may be modulated on a moment to moment basis, the postsynaptic features that determine the effect of released transmitter are not so readily altered to meet changing demands. Different strategies are used by different species to ensure reliable neuromuscular transmission. Some, like frogs, rely on releasing a large amount of transmitter while others, like man, rely on elaborate postsynaptic specialisations to enhance the response to transmitter. In normal adult mammals, the safety factor is generally 3-5. Both pre- and postsynaptic components change during development and may show plasticity in response to injury or disease. Thus, both acquired autoimmune and inherited congenital diseases of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) can significantly reduce, or even transiently increase, safety factor.","The biochemistry and physiology of L-arginine have to be reconsidered in the light of the recent discovery that the amino acid is the only substrate of all isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Generation of nitric oxide, NO, a versatile molecule in signaling processes and unspecific immune defense, is intertwined with synthesis, catabolism and transport of arginine which thus ultimately participates in the regulation of a fine-tuned balance between normal and pathophysiological consequences of NO production. The complex composition of the brain at the cellular level is reflected in a complex differential distribution of the enzymes of arginine metabolism. Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase which together can recycle the NOS coproduct L-citrulline to L-arginine are expressed constitutively in neurons, but hardly colocalize with each other or with NOS in the same neuron. Therefore, trafficking of citrulline and arginine between neurons necessitates transport capacities in these cells which are fulfilled by well-described carriers for cationic and neutral amino acids. The mechanism of intercellular exchange of argininosuccinate, a prerequisite also for its proposed function as a neuromodulator, remains to be elucidated. In cultured astrocytes transcription and protein expression of arginine transport system y(+) and of ASS are upregulated concomittantly with immunostimulant-mediated induction of NOS-2. In vivo ASS-immunoreactivity was found in microglial cells in a rat model of brain inflammation and in neurons and glial cells in the brains of Alzheimer patients. Any attempt to estimate the contributions of arginine transport and synthesis to substrate supply for NOS has to consider competition for arginine between NOS and arginase, the latter enzyme being expressed as mitochondrial isoform II in nervous tissue. Generation of NOS inhibitors agmatine and methylarginines is documented for the nervous system. Suboptimal supply of NOS with arginine leads to production of detrimental peroxynitrite which may result in neuronal cell death. Data have been gathered recently which point to a particular role of astrocytes in neural arginine metabolism. Arginine appears to be accumulated in astroglial cells and can be released after stimulation with a variety of signals. It is proposed that an intercellular citrulline-NO cycle is operating in brain with astrocytes storing arginine for the benefit of neighbouring cells in need of the amino acid for a proper synthesis of NO.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol 2001 Dec;65(6):609.,"During the last two decades, it has become apparent that vasopressin and oxytocin, in addition to playing a role as peptide hormones, also act as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators. A number of arguments support this notion: (i) vasopressin and oxytocin are synthesized not only in hypothalamo-neurohypophysial cells, but also in other hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic cell bodies, whose axon projects to the limbic system, the brainstem and the spinal cord. (ii) Vasopressin and oxytocin can be shed from central axons as are classical neurotransmitters. (iii) Specific binding sites, i.e. membrane receptors having high affinity for vasopressin and oxytocin are present in the central nervous system. (iv) Vasopressin and oxytocin can alter the firing rate of selected neuronal populations. (v) In-situ injection of vasopressin and oxytocin receptor agonists and antagonists can interfere with behavior or physiological regulations. Morphological studies and electrophysiological recordings have evidenced a close anatomical correlation between the presence of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors in the brain and the neuronal responsiveness to vasopressin or oxytocin. These compounds have been found to affect membrane excitability in neurons located in the limbic system, hypothalamus, circumventricular organs, brainstem, and spinal cord. Sharp electrode intracellular recordings and whole-cell recordings, done in brainstem motoneurons or in spinal cord neurons, have revealed that vasopressin and oxytocin can directly affect neuronal excitability by opening non-specific cationic channels or by closing K(+) channels. These neuropeptides can also influence synaptic transmission, by acting either postsynaptically or upon presynaptic target neurons or axon terminals. Whereas, in cultured neurons, vasopressin and oxytocin appear to mobilize intracellular Ca(++), in brainstem slices, the action of oxytocin is mediated by a second messenger that is distinct from the second messenger activated in peripheral target cells. In this review, we will summarize studies carried out at the cellular level, i.e. we will concentrate on in-vitro approaches. Vasopressin and oxytocin will be treated together. Though acting via distinct receptors in distinct brain areas, these two neuropeptides appear to exert similar effects upon neuronal excitability.","Microglia, macrophages that reside in the brain, can express at least 12 different ion channels, including voltage-gated proton channels. The properties of H+ currents in microglia are similar to those in other phagocytes. Proton currents are elicited by depolarizing the membrane potential, but activation also depends strongly on both intracellular pH (pH(i)) and extracellular pH (pH(o)). Increasing pH(o) or lowering pH(i) promotes H+ channel opening by shifting the activation threshold to more negative potentials. H+ channels in microglia open only when the pH gradient is outward, so they carry only outward current in the steady state. Time-dependent activation of H+ currents is slow, with a time constant roughly 1 s at room temperature. Microglial H+ currents are inhibited by inorganic polyvalent cations, which reduce H+ current amplitude and shift the voltage dependence of activation to more positive potentials. Cytoskeletal disruptive agents modulate H+ currents in microglia. Cytochalasin D and colchicine decrease the current density and slow the activation of H+ currents. Similar changes of H+ currents, possibly due to cytoskeletal reorganization, occur in microglia during the transformation from ameboid to ramified morphology. Phagocytes, including microglia, undergo a respiratory burst, in which NADPH oxidase releases bactericidal superoxide anions into the phagosome and stoichiometrically releases protons into the cell, tending to depolarize and acidify the cell. H+ currents may help regulate both the membrane potential and pH(i) during the respiratory burst. By compensating for the efflux of electrons and counteracting intracellular acidification, H+ channels help maintain superoxide anion production.","Dopaminergic neurons and their projection-systems are important in some fundamental human activities like locomotion, feeding and sex, essential for survival and procreation, and are relevant to pathologies like Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. Three main dopaminergic projection-systems, namely the nigrostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways are the major targets of the neuropharmacological actions of psychomotor stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. Studies on knockout mice for dopamine or its receptors provide substantial information but fail to reveal the role of individual dopaminergic projection-systems. Mutant animals with defects specific to one or more projection-systems might be useful for studying the role of individual dopaminergic projection-systems. We propose the weaver mutant mouse, with a defective nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection-system and dopamine depletion in the dorsal striatum but with intact mesocorticolimbic projection-systems, as a suitable model to study the role of individual dopaminergic systems in diverse biological processes including Parkinson's disease and drug abuse.","The steroid hormone estrogen influences brain function and neuropsychiatric disorders, but neuroanatomical information about the estrogen receptors (ERs) are rather limited. The main focus of this article is to provide an overview of the current status of the ER distribution and possible function in the human brain. The ERs are ligand activated transcription factors that belong to the steroid hormone receptors, included in the nuclear receptor superfamily. To date, there are two known ER subtypes, alpha and beta. In the human forebrain, both estrogen receptor subtypes are predominantly expressed in limbic-related areas, although they show distinct distribution patterns. The ERalpha mRNA expression appears to dominate in the hypothalamus and amygdala, indicating that the alpha-subtype might modulate neuronal cell populations involved in autonomic and reproductive neuroendocrine functions as well as emotional interpretation and processing. In contrast, the hippocampal formation, entorhinal cortex, and thalamus appear to be ERbeta dominant areas, suggesting a putative role for ERbeta in cognition, non-emotional memory and motor functions. Clinical observations of estrogenic effects together with the information available today regarding ER expression in the primate brain provide important clues as to the functional aspects of the two ER subtypes. However, further characterization of the different phenotypes of the ER expressing cells in the human brain is needed as well as the delineation of the genes which are regulated by the ERs and how this transcriptional control correlates with human behavior and mental status.","Experimental evidence exists to suggest that zinc can have positive and negative effects on the physiology of cells depending on the ""local"" concentration, localisation (extracellular vs. intracellular) and/or state (bound vs. free). The retina contains particularly high amounts of zinc suggesting a pivotal role in the tissue. There is also suggestive evidence that zinc deficiency in humans may result in abnormal dark adaptation and/or age-related macular degeneration. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of various proposed functions for zinc, particularly in the retina. Endogenous chelatable zinc in the retina is localised mainly to the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells. Moreover, the zinc localisation in the photoreceptors varies in dark and light, suggesting a role for zinc in a light-regulated process. Some zinc is also located to other areas of the retina but clearly defined zinc-enriched neurones could not be identified as has been shown to occur in certain areas of the brain. Neurones post-synaptic to zinc-enriched neurones in the brain have been suggested to be particularly vulnerable in ischaemia. The role of zinc in retinal ischaemia has been investigated to determine how it is involved in the process. It would appear that when zinc is administered in low concentrations it generally has a positive effect on an insulted retina as in ischaemia. However, higher concentrations of zinc exacerbates the influence of the insult and also acts as a toxin. Use of zinc supplements in diet must, therefore, be taken with caution.","In just under 20 years the kynurenine family of compounds has developed from a group of obscure metabolites of the essential amino acid tryptophan into a source of intensive research, with postulated roles for quinolinic acid in neurodegenerative disorders, most especially the AIDS-dementia complex and Huntington's disease. One of the kynurenines, kynurenic acid, has become a standard tool for use in the identification of glutamate-releasing synapses, and has been used as the parent for several groups of compounds now being developed as drugs for the treatment of epilepsy and stroke. The kynurenines represent a major success in translating a basic discovery into a source of clinical understanding and therapeutic application, with around 3000 papers published on quinolinic acid or kynurenic acid since the discovery of their effects in 1981 and 1982. This review concentrates on some of the recent work most directly relevant to the understanding and applications of kynurenines in medicine.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol 2001 Oct;65(2):209-10.,"We review the neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and functional properties of the mammalian subiculum in this paper. The subiculum is a pivotal structure positioned between the hippocampus proper and entorhinal and other cortices, as well as a range of subcortical structures. It is an under-investigated region that plays a key role in the mediation of hippocampal-cortical interaction. We argue that on neuroanatomical, physiological and functional grounds, the subiculum is properly part of the hippocampal formation, given its pivotal role in the hippocampal circuit. We suggest that the term ""subicular complex"" embraces a heterogenous range of distinct structures and this phrase does not connote a functionally or anatomically meaningful grouping of structures. The subiculum has a range of electrophysiological and functional properties which are quite distinct from its input areas; given the widespread set of cortical and subcortical areas with which it interacts, it is able to influence activity in quite disparate brain regions. The rules which govern the plasticity of synaptic transmission are not well-specified; it shares some properties in common with the hippocampus proper, but behaves quite differently in other respects. Equally, its functional properties are not well-understood, it plays an important but ill-defined role both in spatial navigation and in mnemonic processing. The important challenges for the future revolve around the theoretical specification of its unique contribution to hippocampal formation processing on the one hand, and the experimental investigation of the many open questions (anatomical, physiological, pharmacological, functional) regarding its properties, on the other.","Macrophage-mediated segmental demyelination is the pathological hallmark of autoimmune demyelinating polyneuropathies, including the demyelinating form of Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Macrophages serve a multitude of functions throughout the entire pathogenetic process of autoimmune neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages are likely to act as local antigen-presenting cells by their capability to express major histocompatibility complex antigens and costimulatory B7-molecules, and may thus be critical in triggering the autoimmune process. Hematogenous infiltrating macrophages then find their way into the peripheral nerve together with T-cells by the concerted action of adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteases and chemotactic signals. Within the nerve, macrophages regulate inflammation by secreting several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha. Autoantibodies are likely to guide macrophages towards their myelin or primarily axonal targets, which then attack in a complement-dependent and receptor-mediated manner. In addition, non-specific tissue damage occurs through the secretion of toxic mediators and cytokines. Later, macrophages contribute to the termination of inflammation by promoting T-cell apoptosis and expressing anti-inflammatory cytokines including TGF-beta1 and IL-10. During recovery, they are tightly involved in allowing Schwann cell proliferation, remyelination and axonal regeneration to proceed. Macrophages, thus, play dual roles in autoimmune neuropathy, being detrimental in attacking nervous tissue but also salutary, when aiding in the termination of the inflammatory process and the promotion of recovery.","This review summarizes the stimulatory potentials of NO and peroxynitrite (OONO-) on neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system. Exogenous and endogenous NO stimulates to release neurotransmitter. NO synthesized intracellularly diffuses out through neuronal membrane and acts on the outer side of membrane to depolarize neuronal membrane, which triggers neurotransmitter release. NO-induced release of neurotransmitters is mediated by Ca2+-dependent and -independent processes. The latter process is operated by reverse process of the Na+-dependent carrier-mediated neurotransmitter uptake system or by unknown mechanisms. Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitter occurs in part subsequent to increase in Ca2+ influx via VDCCs, although N-type VDCCs may not involve in this action of NO because of suppression of Ca2+ influx through N-type VDCCs by NO. Participation of cGMP formation by NO on neurotransmitter release is controversial. A superoxide scavenger, Ca2+, Zn(2+)-superoxide dismutase, abolishes NO-induced neurotransmitter release and synthesized OONO- induces neurotransmitter release, indicating that OONO- participates in NO-evoked neurotransmitter release.","Most of the gene candidates for the control of developmental programmes that underlie brain morphogenesis in vertebrates are the homologues of Drosophila genes coding for signalling molecules or transcription factors. Among these, the orthodenticle group includes the Drosophila orthodenticle (otd) and the vertebrate Otx1 and Otx2 genes, which are mostly involved in fundamental processes of anterior neural patterning. These genes encode transcription factors that recognise specific target sequences through the DNA binding properties of the homeodomain. In Drosophila, mutations of otd cause the loss of the anteriormost head neuromere where the gene is transcribed, suggesting that it may act as a segmentation ""gap"" gene. In mouse embryos, the expression patterns of Otx1 and Otx2 have shown a remarkable similarity with the Drosophila counterpart. This suggested that they could be part of a conserved control system operating in the brain and different from that coded by the HOX complexes controlling the hindbrain and spinal cord. To verify this hypothesis a series of mouse models have been generated in which the functions of the murine genes were: (i) fully inactivated, (ii) replaced with each others, (iii) replaced with the Drosophila otd gene. Otx1-/- mutants suffer from epilepsy and are affected by neurological, hormonal, and sense organ defects. Otx2-/- mice are embryonically lethal, they show gastrulation impairments and fail in specifying anterior neural plate. Analysis of the Otx1-/-; Otx2+/- double mutants has shown that a minimal threshold level of the proteins they encode is required for the correct positioning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB). In vivo otd/Otx reciprocal gene replacement experiments have provided evidence of a general functional equivalence among otd, Otx1 and Otx2 in fly and mouse. Altogether these data highlight a crucial role for the Otx genes in specification, regionalization and terminal differentiation of rostral central nervous system (CNS) and lead to hypothesize that modification of their regulatory control may have influenced morphogenesis and evolution of the brain.","The gas NO is a messenger that modulates neuronal function. The use of NO donors and NO synthase inhibitors as pharmacological tools revealed that this free radical is probably implicated in the regulation of excitability and firing, in long-term potentiation and long-term depression, as well as in memory processes. Moreover, NO modulates neurotransmitter release. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that, in all brain structures investigated, endogenous NO modulates the release of several neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, catecholamines, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, serotonin, histamine, and adenosine. In most cases, enhanced NO level in the tissue increases the release of neurotransmitters, although decreasing effects have also been observed. Cyclic 3'-5' guanosine monophosphate and glutamate mediate the modulation of transmitter release by NO. Recent observations suggest that the release of some transmitters is dually influenced by NO. Thus, besides modulation by presynaptically located auto- and heteroreceptors, NO released from nitrergic neurons seems to play a universal role in modulating the release of transmitters in the brain.","Integrins, a subgroup of adhesion receptors, are transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate interactions between cytoplasm and the extracellular environment. These interactions influence, among others, events such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Differential expression of integrins is developmentally regulated in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and is associated with crucial events in both physiological and pathological processes. Preliminary studies suggest that integrin expression influences neural crest cell migration, axonal outgrowth, and Schwann cell differentiation. Similarly, the abnormal expression of integrins or their ligands, is associated with degenerative, inflammatory, and malignant disorders of the PNS. Finally, integrins participate in the complex interactions that promote repair of the PNS. A better comprehension of the role of integrins in the PNS, their protein interactions and transducing signals is being achieved by selected biochemical and genetic experiments. Here we review a large bias of evidence suggesting the key functions for integrins in the PNS.","It is suggested that the anatomical structures which mediate consciousness evolved as decisive embellishments to a (non-conscious) design strategy present even in the simplest unicellular organisms. Consciousness is thus not the pinnacle of a hierarchy whose base is the primitive reflex, because reflexes require a nervous system, which the single-celled creature does not possess. By postulating that consciousness is intimately connected to self-paced probing of the environment, also prominent in prokaryotic behavior, one can make mammalian neuroanatomy amenable to dramatically straightforward rationalization. Muscular contraction is the nervous system's only externally directed product, and the signaling routes which pass through the various brain components must ultimately converge on the motor areas. The function of several components is still debatable, so it might seem premature to analyze the global operation of the circuit these routes constitute. But such analysis produces a remarkably simple picture, and it sheds new light on the roles of the individual components. The underlying principle is conditionally permitted movement, some components being able to veto muscular contraction by denying the motor areas sufficient activation. This is true of the basal ganglia (BG) and the cerebellum (Cb), which act in tandem with the sensory cerebrum, and which can prevent the latter's signals to the motor areas from exceeding the threshold for overt movement. It is also true of the anterior cingulate, which appears to play a major role in directing attention. In mammals, the result can be mere thought, provided that a second lower threshold is exceeded. The veto functions of the BG and the Cb stem from inhibition, but the countermanding disinhibition develops at markedly different rates in those two key components. It develops rapidly in the BG, control being exercised by the amygdala, which itself is governed by various other brain regions. It develops over time in the Cb, thereby permitting previously executed movements that have proved advantageous. If cognition is linked to overt or covert movement, intelligence becomes the ability to consolidate individual motor elements into more complex patterns, and creativity is the outcome of a race-to-threshold process which centers on the motor areas. Amongst the ramifications of these ideas are aspects of cortical oscillations, phantom limb sensations, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the difficulty of self-tickling and mirror neurons.","Long-lasting alterations of neuronal functions could involve mechanisms associated with consolidation of transient extracellular signals through modulation of de novo synthesis of particular functional proteins in the brain. In eukaryotes, protein de novo synthesis is mainly under the control at the level of gene transcription by transcription factors in the cell nucleus. Transcription factors are nuclear proteins with an ability to recognize particular core nucleotides at the upstream and/or downstream of target genes, and thereby to modulate the activity of RNA polymerase II that is responsible for the formation of mRNA from double stranded DNA. Gel retardation electrophoresis is widely employed for conventional detection of DNA binding activities of a variety of transcription factors with different protein motifs. Extracellular ionotropic glutamate (Glu) signals lead to rapid and selective potentiation of DNA binding of the nuclear transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP1) that is a homo- and heterodimeric complex between Jun and Fos family members, in addition to inducing expression of the corresponding proteins, in a manner unique to each Glu signal in murine hippocampus. Therefore, extracellular Glu signals may be differentially transduced into the nucleus to express AP1 with different assemblies between Jun and Fos family members, and thereby to modulate de novo synthesis of the individual target proteins at the level of gene transcription in the hippocampus. Such mechanisms may be operative on synaptic plasticity as well as delayed neuronal death through consolidation of alterations of a variety of cellular functions induced by transient extracellular signals in the brain.","Brain cells express extremely different sensitivity to ischemic insults. The reason for this differential vulnerability is still largely unknown. Here we discuss the ionic bases underlying the physiological responses to in vitro ischemia in two neostriatal neuronal subtypes exhibiting respectively high sensitivity and high resistance to energy deprivation. Vulnerable neostriatal neurons respond to ischemia with a membrane depolarization. This membrane depolarization mainly depends on the increased permeability to Na+ ions. In contrast, resistant neostriatal neurons respond to ischemia with a membrane hyperpolarization due to the opening of K+ channels. Interestingly, in both neuronal subtypes the ischemia-dependent membrane potential changes can be significantly enhanced or attenuated by a variety of pharmacological agents interfering with intracellular Ca2+ entry, ATP-dependent K+ channels opening, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger functioning. The understanding of the ionic mechanisms underlying the differential membrane responses to ischemia represents the basis for the development of rational neuroprotective treatments during acute cerebrovascular insults.","This review summarizes recent work on the use of reporter genes to label selected neuronal populations in transgenic mice, with particular emphasis on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Reporter genes discussed are the lacZ, green fluorescent protein (GFP), luc, and bla genes, which encode the reporter proteins beta-galactosidase, GFP, luciferase, and beta-lactamase, respectively. Targeted transgenic expression of these reporter proteins is obtained by fusing the corresponding reporter gene, with or without a subcellular localization signal, to a cell type- or brain region-specific gene promoter. Mice carrying GnRH promoter-driven reporter genes have proven useful for revealing the promoter elements required for cell type-specific expression of GnRH, the full anatomical profile of the GnRH neuronal network, and its electrophysiological activity, suggesting that similar approaches will assist in elucidating the properties of other neuronal populations as well.","Histamine-releasing neurons are located exclusively in the TM of the hypothalamus, from where they project to practically all brain regions, with ventral areas (hypothalamus, basal forebrain, amygdala) receiving a particularly strong innervation. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of TM neurons (slow spontaneous firing, broad action potentials, deep after hyperpolarisations, etc.) are extremely similar to other aminergic neurons. Their firing rate varies across the sleep-wake cycle, being highest during waking and lowest during rapid-eye movement sleep. In contrast to other aminergic neurons somatodendritic autoreceptors (H3) do not activate an inwardly rectifying potassium channel but instead control firing by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels. Histamine release is enhanced under extreme conditions such as dehydration or hypoglycemia or by a variety of stressors. Histamine activates four types of receptors. H1 receptors are mainly postsynaptically located and are coupled positively to phospholipase C. High densities are found especially in the hypothalamus and other limbic regions. Activation of these receptors causes large depolarisations via blockade of a leak potassium conductance, activation of a non-specific cation channel or activation of a sodium-calcium exchanger. H2 receptors are also mainly postsynaptically located and are coupled positively to adenylyl cyclase. High densities are found in hippocampus, amygdala and basal ganglia. Activation of these receptors also leads to mainly excitatory effects through blockade of calcium-dependent potassium channels and modulation of the hyperpolarisation-activated cation channel. H3 receptors are exclusively presynaptically located and are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. High densities are found in the basal ganglia. These receptors mediated presynaptic inhibition of histamine release and the release of other neurotransmitters, most likely via inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels. Finally, histamine modulates the glutamate NMDA receptor via an action at the polyamine binding site. The central histamine system is involved in many central nervous system functions: arousal; anxiety; activation of the sympathetic nervous system; the stress-related release of hormones from the pituitary and of central aminergic neurotransmitters; antinociception; water retention and suppression of eating. A role for the neuronal histamine system as a danger response system is proposed.","Presynaptic action potentials trigger the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. However, even in the absence of depolarisation-dependent Ca2+ entry nearby release sites, spontaneous vesicular release still occurs. Even though this happens at low rate, such spontaneous release may play a trophic role in maintaining the shape of dendritic structures. Like evoked responses, action potential-independent release is subject to modulation. This review describes some of the regulatory factors that rapidly and presynaptically regulate the ongoing Ca2+-independent release of neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. For instance, the electrical activity of the nerve ending, neurotransmitters, hypertonic solutions, neurotoxins, polycations, neurotrophic factors, immunoglobulins, cyclothiazide and psychotropic drugs can all modify the rate of spontaneous release. This can be achieved through various mechanisms that can be Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent, protein kinase-dependent or independent. Since action potential-independent release contributes to the maintenance of dendritic structures, neuromodulators are likely to influence the density and/or length of dendritic spines, which in turn may modulate information processing in the central nervous system (CNS).","Mammalian tissues contain at least two types of cannabinoid receptor, CB(1) and CB(2), both coupled to G proteins. CB(1) receptors are expressed mainly by neurones of the central and peripheral nervous system whereas CB(2) receptors occur centrally and peripherally in certain non-neuronal tissues, particularly in immune cells. The existence of endogenous ligands for cannabinoid receptors has also been demonstrated. The discovery of this 'endocannabinoid system' has prompted the development of a range of novel cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists, including several that show marked selectivity for CB(1) or CB(2) receptors. It has also been paralleled by a renewed interest in cannabinoid-induced antinociception. This review summarizes current knowledge about the ability of cannabinoids to produce antinociception in animal models of acute pain as well as about the ability of these drugs to suppress signs of tonic pain induced in animals by nerve damage or by the injection of an inflammatory agent. Particular attention is paid to the types of pain against which cannabinoids may be effective, the distribution pattern of cannabinoid receptors in central and peripheral pain pathways and the part that these receptors play in cannabinoid-induced antinociception. The possibility that antinociception can be mediated by cannabinoid receptors other than CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, for example CB(2)-like receptors, is also discussed as is the evidence firstly that one endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, produces antinociception through mechanisms that differ from those of other types of cannabinoid, for example by acting on vanilloid receptors, and secondly that the endocannabinoid system has physiological and/or pathophysiological roles in the modulation of pain.",Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) potentials in focal epilepsies are sustained by synchronous paroxysmal membrane depolarization generated by assemblies of hyperexcitable neurons. It is currently believed that interictal spiking sets a condition that preludes to the onset of an ictal discharge. Such an assumption is based on little experimental evidence. Human pre-surgical studies and recordings in chronic and acute models of focal epilepsy showed that: (i) interictal spikes (IS) and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms; (ii) the cortical region that generates IS (irritative area) does not coincide with the ictal-onset area; (iii) IS frequency does not increase before a seizure and is enhanced just after an ictal event; (iv) spike suppression is found to herald ictal discharges; and (v) enhancement of interictal spiking suppresses ictal events. Several experimental evidences indicate that the highly synchronous cellular discharge associated with an IS is generated by a multitude of mechanisms involving synaptic and non-synaptic communication between neurons. The synchronized neuronal discharge associated with a single IS induces and is followed by a profound and prolonged refractory period sustained by inhibitory potentials and by activity-dependent changes in the ionic composition of the extracellular space. Post-spike depression may be responsible for pacing interictal spiking periodicity commonly observed in both animal models and human focal epilepsies. It is proposed that the strong after-inhibition produced by IS protects against the occurrence of ictal discharges by maintaining a low level of excitation in a general condition of hyperexcitability determined by the primary epileptogenic dysfunction.,"Not later than two synapses after their arrival in the cerebellar cortex all excitatory afferent signals are subsequently transformed into inhibitory ones. Guaranteed by the exceedingly ordered and stereotyped synaptic arrangement of its cellular elements, the cerebellar cortex transmits this inhibitory result of cerebellar integration exclusively via Purkinje cells (PCs) in a precise temporal succession directly onto the target neurons of the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Thus the cerebellar cortex seems to produce a temporal pattern of inhibitory influence on these target neurons that modifies their excitatory action in such a way that an activation of muscle fibers occurs which progressively integrates the intended motion into the actual condition of the motoric inventory. In consequence, disturbances that affect this cerebellar inhibition will cause uncoordinated, decomposed and ataxic movements, commonly referred to as cerebellar ataxia. Electrophysiological investigations using different cerebellar mouse mutants have shown that alterations in the cerebellar inhibitory input in the target nuclei lead to diverse neuronal responses and to different consequences for the behavioural phenotype. A dependence between the reconstitution of inhibition and the behavioural outcome seems to exist. Obviously two different basic mechanisms are responsible for these observations: (1) ineffective inhibition on target neurons by surviving PCs; and (2) enhancement of intranuclear inhibition in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Which of the two strategies evolves is dependent upon the composition of the residual cell types in the cerebellum and on the degree of PC input loss in a given area of the target nuclei. Motor behaviour seems to deteriorate under the first of these mechanisms whereas it may benefit from the second. This is substantiated by stereotaxic removal of the remaining PC input, which eliminates the influence of the first mechanism and is able to induce the second strategy. As a consequence, motor performance improves considerably. In this review, results leading to the above conclusions are presented and links forged to human cerebellar diseases.","This paper reviews the development of our research on the motor consequences of Mauthner cell function and related brainstem neurons. These cells activate fast-start responses such as seen in fishes escaping from predatory attacks. Our goal was to devise a neuroethological theory of fish escape that accurately reconciled the underlying neural function with a correct concept of the motor act. The identified neuron concept of invertebrates greatly influenced the initial studies. Horseradish peroxidase technology allowed us and other workers to identify principal neurons in the brainstem escape system. Digital imaging technology permitted adequate kinematic characterization of the behavior. Resulting experiments showed that Mauthner system demonstrates two general principles of motor organization: (1) the Mauthner cell is a command-like higher order neuron that serially outputs to a lower level central pattern generator; and (2) the Mauthner cell participates in a larger parallel, brainstem escape network. In this network, we showed that the spatio-temporal pattern of activity codes the timing and magnitude of agonist and antagonist trunk muscle contractions during the behavior. Because the approach angle of the stimulus determines these parameters, we were able to discover the overall sensorimotor relationship between stimulus angle and motor output. This relationship is given as a set of descriptive equations written in terms of stimulus angle, magnitude and timing variables of trunk muscle contractions, and resulting escape trajectory. The equations unify the apparent variability of C-start movement patterns into a single, quantitative theory. Recent studies by other workers show how this concept can make accurate predictions about the underlying neural processes, even at the level of the single, identified cell.","Among the advantages offered by the lamprey brainstem and spinal cord for studies of the structure and function of the nervous system is the unique identifiability of several pairs of reticulospinal neurons in the brainstem. These neurons have been exploited in investigations of the patterns of sensory input to these cells and the patterns of their outputs to spinal neurons, but no doubt these cells could be used much more effectively in exploring their roles in descending control of the spinal cord. The variability of cell positions of neurons in the spinal cord has precluded the recognition of unique spinal neurons. However, classes of nerve cells can be readily defined and characterized within the lamprey spinal cord and this has led to progress in understanding the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of locomotor activity. In addition, both the identifiable reticulospinal cells and the various spinal nerve cell classes and their known synaptic interactions have been used to demonstrate the degree and specificity of regeneration within the lamprey nervous system. The lack of uniquely identifiable cells within the lamprey spinal cord has hampered progress in these areas, especially in gaining a full understanding of the locomotor network and how neuromodulation of the network is accomplished.","Studies of insect identified neurons over the past 25 years have provided some of the very best data on sensorimotor integration; tracing information flow from sensory to motor networks. General principles have emerged that have increased the sophistication with which we now understand both sensory processing and motor control. Two overarching themes have emerged from studies of identified sensory interneurons. First, within a species, there are profound differences in neuronal organization associated with both the sex and the social experience of the individual. Second, single neurons exhibit some surprisingly rich examples of computational sophistication in terms of (a) temporal dynamics (coding superimposed upon circadian and shorter-term rhythms), and also (b) what Kenneth Roeder called ""neural parsimony"": that optimal information can be encoded, and complex acts of sensorimotor coordination can be mediated, by small ensembles of cells. Insect motor systems have proven to be relatively complex, and so studies of their organization typically have not yielded completely defined circuits as are known from some other invertebrates. However, several important findings have emerged. Analysis of neuronal oscillators for rhythmic behavior have delineated a profound influence of sensory feedback on interneuronal circuits: they are not only modulated by feedback, but may be substantially reconfigured. Additionally, insect motor circuits provide potent examples of neuronal restructuring during an organism's lifetime, as well as insights on how circuits have been modified across evolutionary time. Several areas where future advances seem likely to occur include: molecular genetic analyses, neuroecological syntheses, and neuroinformatics--the use of digital resources to organize databases with information on identified nerve cells and behavior.","Research on identified neurons during the last quarter century was forecast at a conference in 1973 that discussed ""neuronal mechanisms of coordination in simple systems."" The focus of the conference was on the neuronal control of simple stereotyped behavioral acts. Participants discussing the future of such research called for a comparative approach; emphasis on structure-function interactions; attention to environmental and behavioral context; and the development of new techniques. Significantly, in some cases amazing progress has been made in these areas. Major conclusions of the last quarter century are that so-called simple behaviors and the neural circuitry underlying them tend to be less simple, more flexible, and more highly modulated than originally imagined. However, the comparative approach has, as yet, failed to reach its potential. Molluscan preparations, along with arthropods and annelids, have always been at the forefront of neuroethological studies. Circuitry underlying feeding has been studied in a handful of species of gastropod molluscs. These studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of sensorimotor organization, the hierarchical control of behavior and coordination of multiple behaviors, and the organization and modulation of central pattern generators. However, direct interspecific comparisons of feeding circuitry and potentially homologous neurons have been lacking. This is unfortunate because much of the vast radiation of the class Gastropoda is associated with variations in feeding behaviors and feeding apparatuses, providing ample substrates for comparative studies including the evolution of defined circuitry. Here, the neural organization of feeding in the snail, Helisoma, is examined critically. Possible direct interspecific comparisons of neural circuitry and potentially homologous neurons are made. A universal model for central pattern generators underlying rasping feeding is proposed. Future comparative studies can be expected to combine behavioral, morphological, electrophysiological, molecular and genetic techniques to identify neurons and define neural circuitry. Digital resources will undoubtedly be exploited to organize and interface databases allowing illumination of the evolution of homologous identified neurons and defined neural circuitry in the context of behavioral change.","Since the experiments of Nicholls and Baylor, the initial characterization of identified neurons has provided significant insight into the circuitry transforming mechanosensory input into the motor output of swimming. From physiological characterization of only a small percentage of cells within the leech CNS, we have gained important information about how the decision to swim is processed and how the rhythmic motor pattern is generated. While many of the synaptic connections in the swim-generating circuit have been identified, the elucidation of the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms underlying these connections has only recently begun. The observation that constant input can result in variable motor output suggests that, in addition to describing a cell's identity in terms of structure and function, factors such as behavioral context and the ""internal state"" of the nervous system must also be considered. As circuits controlling other behaviors become known, one can examine the interactions between these networks to understand issues of behavioral choice at the level of identified neurons. The leech CNS has expanded our understanding of how the nervous system produces behavior and continues to serve as an excellent model in this endeavor.","The ontogenetic approach to physiological events is a useful strategy for understanding the functional organization/architecture of the vertebrate brainstem. However, conventional electrophysiological techniques are difficult or impossible to employ in the early embryonic central nervous system. Optical techniques using voltage-sensitive dyes have made it possible to monitor neural activities from multiple regions of living systems, and have proven to be a useful tool for analyzing the embryogenetic expression of brainstem neural function. This review describes recent progress in optical studies made on embryonic chick and rat brainstems. Several technical issues concerning optical recording from the embryonic brainstem preparations are discussed, and characteristics of the optical signals evoked by cranial nerve stimulation or occurring spontaneously are described. Special attention is paid to the chronological analyses of embryogenetic expression of brainstem function and to the spatial patterning of the functional organization/architecture of the brainstem nuclei. In addition, optical analyses of glutamate, GABA, and glycine receptor functions during embryogenesis are described in detail for the chick nucleus tractus solitarius. This review also discusses intrinsic optical signals associated with neuronal depolarization. Some emphases are also placed on the physiological properties of embryonic brainstem neurons, which may be of interest from the viewpoint of developmental neurobiology.","Although the neuropathological changes caused by severe or repeated seizures have been well characterized, many questions about the molecular mechanisms involved remain unanswered. Neuronal cell death, reactive gliosis, enhanced neurogenesis, and axonal sprouting are four of the best-studied sequelae of seizures. In vitro, each of these pathological processes can be substantially influenced by soluble protein factors, including neurotrophins, cytokines, and growth factors. Furthermore, many of these proteins and their receptors are expressed in the adult brain and are up-regulated in response to neuronal activity and injury. We review the evidence that these intercellular signaling proteins regulate seizure activity as well as subsequent pathology in vivo. As nerve growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor are the best-studied proteins of this class, we begin by discussing the evidence linking these neurotrophins to epilepsy and seizure. More than a dozen additional cytokines, growth factors, and neurotrophins that have been examined in the context of epilepsy models are then considered. We discuss the effect of seizure on expression of cytokines and growth factors, and explore the regulation of seizure development and aftermath by exogenous application or antagonist perturbation of these proteins. The experimental evidence supports a role for these factors in each aspect of seizure and pathology, and suggests potential targets for future therapeutics.","Cellular genes that are mutated in neurodegenerative diseases code for proteins that are expressed throughout neural development. Genetic analysis suggests that these genes are essential for a broad range of normal neurodevelopmental processes. The proteins they code for interact with numerous other cellular proteins that are components of signaling pathways involved in patterning of the neural tube and in regional specification of neuronal subtypes. Further, pathogenetic mutations of these genes can cause progressive, sublethal alterations in the cellular homeostasis of evolving regional neuronal subpopulations, culminating in late-onset cell death. Therefore, as a consequence of the disease mutations, targeted cell populations may retain molecular traces of abnormal interactions with disease-associated proteins by exhibiting changes in a spectrum of normal cellular functions and enhanced vulnerability to a host of environmental stressors. These observations suggest that the normal functions of these disease-associated proteins are to ensure the fidelity and integration of developmental events associated with the progressive elaboration of neuronal subtypes as well as the maintenance of mature neuronal populations during adult life. The ability to identify alterations within vulnerable neuronal precursors present in pre-symptomatic individuals prior to the onset of irrevocable cellular injury may help foster the development of effective therapeutic interventions using evolving pharmacologic, gene and stem cell technologies.","In this review, we have tried to summarize most available data dealing with the aquaporin (AQP) family of water channels in the CNS. Two aquaporins have been identified so far in the CNS, AQP1 and AQP4. AQP1 is restricted to the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles, which raises a role for this aquaporin in cerebrospinal fluid formation. AQP4 is the predominant water channel in the brain and it is more widely distributed than originally believed, with a marked prevalence over periventricular areas. In the first part of this review, we examine the complete distribution pattern of AQP4 in the CNS including its rostro-caudal localization to end with its subcellular location. After discussing scarce data dealing with regulation of aquaporins in the CNS, we focus in potential roles for aquaporins. Novel recent data highlights very important roles for this aquaporin in the normal and pathological brain including, among others, role in potassium buffering, body fluid homeostasis, central osmoreception and development and restoration of brain edema.","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to be involved in the mediation of complex behavioral responses. Considerable research efforts are directed towards refining the knowledge about the function of this brain area and the role it plays in cognitive performance and behavioral output. In the first part, this review provides, from a pharmacological perspective, an overview of anatomical, electrophysiological and neurochemical aspects of the function of the PFC, with an emphasis on the mesocortical dopamine system. Anatomy of the mesocortical system, basic physiological and pharmacological properties of neurotransmission within the PFC, and interactions between dopamine and glutamate as well as other transmitters within the mesocorticolimbic circuit are included. The coverage of these data is largely restricted to what is relevant for the second part of the review which focuses on behavioral studies that have examined the role of the PFC in a variety of phenomena, behaviors and paradigms. These include reward and addiction, locomotor activity and sensitization, learning, cognition, and schizophrenia. Although the focus of this review is on the mesocortical dopamine system, given the intricate interactions of dopamine with other transmitter systems within the PFC and the importance of the PFC as a source of glutamate in subcortical areas, these aspects are also covered in some detail where appropriate. Naturally, a topic as complex as this cannot be covered comprehensively in its entirety. Therefore this review is largely limited to data derived from studies using rats, and it is also specifically restricted to data concerning the medial PFC (mPFC). Since in several fields of research the findings concerning the function or role of the mPFC are relatively inconsistent, the question is addressed whether these inconsistencies might, at least in part, be related to the anatomical and functional heterogeneity of this brain area.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a small dimeric protein, structurally related to nerve growth factor, which is abundantly and widely expressed in the adult mammalian brain. BDNF has been found to promote survival of all major neuronal types affected in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, like hippocampal and neocortical neurons, cholinergic septal and basal forebrain neurons, and nigral dopaminergic neurons. In this article, we summarize recent work on the molecular and cellular biology of BDNF, including current ideas about its intracellular trafficking, regulated synthesis and release, and actions at the synaptic level, which have considerably expanded our conception of BDNF actions in the central nervous system. But our primary aim is to review the literature regarding BDNF distribution in the human brain, and the modifications of BDNF expression which occur in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our knowledge concerning BDNF actions on the neuronal populations affected in these pathological states is also reviewed, with an aim at understanding its pathogenic and pathophysiological relevance.","Contrary to a century-old belief that dendritic spines are stable storage sites of long term memory, the emerging picture from a recent flurry of exciting observations using novel high resolution imaging methods of living cells in culture is that of a dynamic structure, which undergoes fast morphological changes over periods of hours and even minutes. Concurrently, the nature of stimuli which cause formation or collapse of dendritic spines has changed from a mysterious Hebbian-governed plasticity producing stimulus to the more trivial activation of the synapse by strong/weak stimulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying spine plasticity are beginning to emerge; the role of presynaptic and/or postsynaptic activity, genetic, central or local factors in the formation and retraction of spines are currently being analyzed. A common mechanism for both, formation/elongation and pruning/retraction of spines, involving changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), is emerging. It appears that [Ca(2+)](i) is related to changes in spines in a bell shape form: lack of synaptic activity causes transient outgrowth of filopodia but eventual elimination of spines, a moderate rise in [Ca(2+)](i) causes elongation of existing spines and formation of new ones, while a massive increase in [Ca(2+)](i) such as that seen in seizure activity, causes fast shrinkage and eventual collapse of spines. Nuclear signals (e.g. CREB), activated by an increase in [Ca(2+)](i), are involved in the central regulation of spine formation, while spine shrinkage and elongation are probably triggered by local [Ca(2+)](i) changes. This hypothesis provides a parsimonious explanation for conflicting reports on activity-dependent changes in dendritic spine morphology. Still, the many differences between cultured neurons, with which most of current studies are conducted, and the neuron in the real brain, require a cautious extrapolation of current assumptions on the regulation of spine formation.","This review highlights recent evidence from clinical and basic science studies supporting a role for estrogen in neuroprotection. Accumulated clinical evidence suggests that estrogen exposure decreases the risk and delays the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and may also enhance recovery from traumatic neurological injury such as stroke. Recent basic science studies show that not only does exogenous estradiol decrease the response to various forms of insult, but the brain itself upregulates both estrogen synthesis and estrogen receptor expression at sites of injury. Thus, our view of the role of estrogen in neural function must be broadened to include not only its function in neuroendocrine regulation and reproductive behaviors, but also to include a direct protective role in response to degenerative disease or injury. Estrogen may play this protective role through several routes. Key among these are estrogen dependent alterations in cell survival, axonal sprouting, regenerative responses, enhanced synaptic transmission and enhanced neurogenesis. Some of the mechanisms underlying these effects are independent of the classically defined nuclear estrogen receptors and involve unidentified membrane receptors, direct modulation of neurotransmitter receptor function, or the known anti-oxidant activities of estrogen. Other neuroprotective effects of estrogen do depend on the classical nuclear estrogen receptor, through which estrogen alters expression of estrogen responsive genes that play a role in apoptosis, axonal regeneration, or general trophic support. Yet another possibility is that estrogen receptors in the membrane or cytoplasm alter phosphorylation cascades through direct interactions with protein kinases or that estrogen receptor signaling may converge with signaling by other trophic molecules to confer resistance to injury. Although there is clear evidence that estradiol exposure can be deleterious to some neuronal populations, the potential clinical benefits of estrogen treatment for enhancing cognitive function may outweigh the associated central and peripheral risks. Exciting and important avenues for future investigation into the protective effects of estrogen include the optimal ligand and doses that can be used clinically to confer benefit without undue risk, modulation of neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor expression, interaction of estrogen with regulated cofactors and coactivators that couple estrogen receptors to basal transcriptional machinery, interactions of estrogen with other survival and regeneration promoting factors, potential estrogenic effects on neuronal replenishment, and modulation of phenotypic choices by neural stem cells.","The paper reviews the main findings of studies of hemispatial neglect after acquired brain lesions in people. The behavioral consequences of experimentally induced lesions in animals and electrophysiological studies, which shed light on the nature of the disorder, are briefly considered. Neglect is behaviorally defined as a deficit in processing or responding to sensory stimuli in the contralateral hemispace, a part of the own body, the part of an imagined scene, or may include the failure to act with the contralesional limbs despite intact motor functions. Neglect in humans is frequently encountered after right parieto-temporal lesions and leads to a multicomponent syndrome of sensory, motor and representational deficits. Relevant findings relating to neglect, extinction and unawareness are reviewed and include the following topics: etiological and anatomical basis, recovery; allocentric, egocentric, object-centered and representational neglect; motor neglect and directional hypokinesia; elementary sensorimotor and associated disorders; subdivisions of space and frames of reference; extinction versus neglect; covert processing of information; unawareness of deficits; human and animal models; effects of sensory stimulation and rehabilitation techniques.","The tripeptide glutathione is the thiol compound present in the highest concentration in cells of all organs. Glutathione has many physiological functions including its involvement in the defense against reactive oxygen species. The cells of the human brain consume about 20% of the oxygen utilized by the body but constitute only 2% of the body weight. Consequently, reactive oxygen species which are continuously generated during oxidative metabolism will be generated in high rates within the brain. Therefore, the detoxification of reactive oxygen species is an essential task within the brain and the involvement of the antioxidant glutathione in such processes is very important. The main focus of this review article will be recent results on glutathione metabolism of different brain cell types in culture. The glutathione content of brain cells depends strongly on the availability of precursors for glutathione. Different types of brain cells prefer different extracellular glutathione precursors. Glutathione is involved in the disposal of peroxides by brain cells and in the protection against reactive oxygen species. In coculture astroglial cells protect other neural cell types against the toxicity of various compounds. One mechanism for this interaction is the supply by astroglial cells of glutathione precursors to neighboring cells. Recent results confirm the prominent role of astrocytes in glutathione metabolism and the defense against reactive oxygen species in brain. These results also suggest an involvement of a compromised astroglial glutathione system in the oxidative stress reported for neurological disorders.","One of the theories involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the oxidative stress hypothesis. The amyloid beta-peptide (A beta), a hallmark in the pathogenesis of AD and the main component of senile plaques, generates free radicals in a metal-catalyzed reaction inducing neuronal cell death by a reactive oxygen species mediated process which damage neuronal membrane lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore, the interest in the protective role of different antioxidants in AD such as vitamin E, melatonin and estrogens is growing up. In this review we summarize data that support the involvement of oxidative stress as an active factor in A beta-mediated neuropathology, by triggering or facilitating neurodegeneration, through a wide range of molecular events that disturb neuronal cell homeostasis.","Early after the development of aspirin, almost 150 years ago, its auditory toxicity has been associated with high doses employed in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Tinnitus, loss of absolute acoustic sensitivity and alterations of perceived sounds are the three auditory alterations described by human subjects after ingestion of large doses of salicylate. They develop over the initials days of treatment but may then level off, fluctuate or decrease, and are reversible within a few days of cessation of treatment. They may also occur within hours of ingestion of an extremely large dose. Individual subjects vary notably as to their susceptibility to salicylate-induced auditory toxicity. Tinnitus may be the first subjective symptom, and is often described as a continuous high pitch sound of mild loudness. The hearing loss is slight to moderate, bilaterally symmetrical and affects all frequencies with often a predominance at the high frequencies. Alterations of perceived sounds include broadening of frequency filtering, alterations in temporal detection, deterioration of speech understanding and hypersensitivity to noise. Behavioral conditioning of animals provides evidence for mild and reversible hearing loss and tinnitus, similar to those observed in humans. Anatomical examinations revealed significant alterations only at outer hair cell lateral membrane. Electrophysiological investigations showed no change in endocochlear resting potential, and small changes in the compound sensory potentials, cochlear microphonic and summating potential, at low acoustic levels. Measures of cochlear mechanical responses to sounds indicated a clear loss of absolute sensitivity and an associated broadening of frequency filtering, both of a magnitude similar to audiometric alterations in humans, but at extremely high salicylate levels. Otoacoustic emissions demonstrated changes in the mechano-sensory functioning of the cochlea in the form of decrease of spontaneous emissions and reduced nonlinearities. In vitro measures of isolated outer hair cells showed reduction of their fast motile responses which are thought to be at the origin of cochlear absolute sensitivity and associated fine filtering. Acoustically evoked neural responses from the eighth nerve to the auditory cortex showed reversible and mild losses of absolute sensitivity and associated broadening of frequency filtering. There is no evidence of a direct alteration of cochlear efferent innervation. Evidence was obtained for decreases in cochlear blood supply under control of autonomous innervation. Spontaneous neural activity of the auditory nerve revealed increases in firings and/or in underlying temporal synchronies. Similar effects were found at the inferior colliculus, mostly at the external nucleus, and at the cortex, mostly at the anterior and less at the secondary auditory cortex but not at the primary auditory cortex. These changes in spontaneous activity might underlie tinnitus as they affect mostly neural elements coding high frequencies, can occur without a loss of sensitivity, are dose dependent, develop progressively, and are reversible. Biochemical cochlear alterations are poorly known. Modifications of oxydative phosphorylation does not seem to occur, involvement of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis appears controversial but could underlie changes in blood supply. Other biochemical alterations certainly also occur at outer hair cells and at afferent nerve fibers but remain unknown.","Over the past decade, a growing body of evidence has emerged on the existence in the brain of a close bidirectional communication system between neurones and astrocytes. This article reviews recent advances in understanding the rules governing these interactions and describes putative, novel functions attributable to astrocytes in neuronal transmission. Astrocytes can respond to the neurotransmitter released from active synaptic terminals, with cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations whose frequency is under the dynamic control of neuronal activity. In response to these neuronal signals, astrocytes can signal back to neurones by releasing various neurone active compounds, such as the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Interestingly, there is accumulating evidence that glutamate is released via a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism which may share common properties with neurotransmitter exocytosis in neurones. This bidirectional communication system between neurones and astrocytes may lead to profound changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. While there clearly is an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work yet to figure out, a coherent view is now emerging which incorporates the astrocyte, with the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic target neurone, as a possible third functional element of the synapse.","The number of identified growth factors continues to increase rapidly with many being implicated in the development of the nervous system, although for most of them the autocrine and paracrine pathways of cellular regulation still remain to be elucidated. The primary olfactory pathway, consisting of the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, is presented here as a very useful model for the analysis of growth factor function. Review of the available literature suggests that a large proportion of neuroactive growth factors and their receptors are present in the olfactory epithelium or olfactory bulb. Furthermore, the primary olfactory pathway is one of the most plastic in the nervous system with neurogenesis continuing to contribute new sensory neurones in the olfactory epithelium and new interneurones in the olfactory bulb throughout adult life. The rich diversity of growth factors and their receptors in the olfactory system indicates that it will be useful in elucidating how these molecules regulate the formation of the nervous system. The olfactory epithelium in particular is proving useful as a model for the actions of growth factors in directing the neuronal lineage from stem cell to mature neurone.","Headache is a common problem which besets most of us at some time or the other. The pharmacology of headache is complex in an overall sense but can be understood in terms of the anatomy and physiology of the pain-producing structures. Migraine can be used as a template to understand the activation of nociceptive systems in the head and thus their neurotransmitter mediation and modulation. In recent years, the role of serotonin (5-HT) in headache pharmacology has been unravelled in the context of both understanding its role in the nociceptive systems related to headache and by exploiting its 5-HT1 receptor subtypes in headache therapeutics. The pharmacology of the head pain systems, as they are known and as they might evolve, are explored in the context of both, the anatomy and physiology of trigeminovascular nociception and in the context of clinical questions, such as those of efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse events.","The Midline Glia of Drosophila are required for nervous system morphogenesis and midline axon guidance during embryogenesis. In origin, gene expression and function, this lineage is analogous to the floorplate of the vertebrate neural tube. The expression or function of over 50 genes, summarised here, has been linked to the Midline Glia. Like the floorplate, the cells which generate the Midline Glia lineage, the mesectoderm, are determined by the interaction of ectoderm and mesoderm during gastrulation. Determination and differentiation of the Midline Glia involves the Drosophila EGF, Notch and segment polarity signaling pathways, as well as twelve identified transcription factors. The Midline Glia lineage has two phases of cell proliferation and of programmed cell death. During embryogenesis, the EGF receptor pathway signaling and Wrapper protein both function to suppress apoptosis only in those MG which are appropriately positioned to separate and ensheath midline axonal commissures. Apoptosis during metamorphosis is regulated by the insect steroid, Ecdysone. The Midline Glia participate in both the attraction of axonal growth cones towards the midline, as well as repulsion of growth cones from the midline. Midline axon guidance requires the Drosophila orthologs of vertebrate genes expressed in the floorplate, which perform the same function. Genetic and molecular evidence of the interaction of attractive (Netrin) and repellent (Slit) signaling is reviewed and summarised in a model. The Midline Glia participate also in the generation of extracellular matrix and in trophic interactions with axons. Genetic evidence for these functions is reviewed.","Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family with which it shares the same receptor, the EGF receptor (EGFR or erbB1). Identified since 1985 in the central nervous system (CNS), its functions in this organ have started to be determined during the past decade although numerous questions remain unanswered. TGFalpha is widely distributed in the nervous system, both glial and neuronal cells contributing to its synthesis. Although astrocytes appear as its main targets, mediating in part TGFalpha effects on different neuronal populations, results from different studies have raised the possibility for a direct action of this growth factor on neurons. A large array of experimental data have thus pointed to TGFalpha as a multifunctional factor in the CNS. This review is an attempt to present, in a comprehensive manner, the very diverse works performed in vitro and in vivo which have provided evidences for (i) an intervention of TGFalpha in the control of developmental events such as neural progenitors proliferation/cell fate choice, neuronal survival/differentiation, and neuronal control of female puberty onset, (ii) its role as a potent regulator of astroglial metabolism including astrocytic reactivity, (iii) its neuroprotective potential, and (iv) its participation to neuropathological processes as exemplified by astroglial neoplasia. In addition, informations regarding the complex modes of TGFalpha action at the molecular level are provided, and its place within the large EGF family is precised with regard to the potential interactions and substitutions which may take place between TGFalpha and its kindred.","The release of large dense core vesicles (LDCV) by neuroendocrine cells displays a very similar calcium dependence as found in synapses, yet, the organization of channels and vesicles is quite different. Various biophysical properties of the release process, notably a large delay (>10 ms) between excitation and release and a high impact of mobile calcium buffers, suggest that, generally, vesicles and channels do not co-localize as in synapses, but are separated by a distance of 100-300 nm. This review focuses on the consequences of this organization for the functional coupling of calcium channels to LDCV-release in neuroendocrine cells. The large distance between LDCV and calcium channels in neuroendocrine cells obviates molecular interactions between channels and fusion peptides and implies that each type of calcium channel may be involved in release. Thus, preferential functional coupling of specific calcium channel types to the exocytotic process may be completely lacking, as in melanotropes. Alternatively, it may be present to some extent to induce differences in coupling efficacy between channel types, as in calf chromaffin cells and mouse pancreatic beta-cells. Physiological mechanisms, like recruitment of channels through facilitation processes or suppression of channels through inactivation, may change coupling characteristics during activity. Due to the large distance between channels and vesicles, single action potentials (APs) are usually insufficient to elicit release, and the coupling between individual APs and release is loose. Most neuroendocrine cells are therefore seen to fire in bursts, like pancreatic beta-cells. Furthermore, a large variation in shape and duration of the APs, with APs of up to 300 ms as in melanotropes, acts as another mechanism to enhance stimulus secretion coupling.","Taurine is held to function as a modulator and osmoregulator in the central nervous system, being of particular importance in the immature brain. In view of the possible involvement of excitatory pathways in the regulation of taurine function in the brain, the interference of glutamate receptors with taurine release from different tissue preparations in vitro and from the brain in vivo is of special interest. The release of taurine from the brain is enhanced by glutamate receptor agonists. This enhancement is inhibited by the respective receptor antagonists both in vitro and in vivo. The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor agonists appear to be the most effective in enhancing taurine release, their effects being receptor-mediated. Kainate is less effective, particularly in adults. Of the glutamate receptors, the NMDA class seems to be the most susceptible to modulation by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide also modulates taurine release, enhancing the basal release in both immature and mature hippocampus, whereas the K(+)-stimulated release is generally inhibited. Metabotropic glutamate receptors also participate in the regulation of taurine release, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiating the release in the developing hippocampus, while group III receptors may be involved in the adult. Under various cell-damaging conditions, including ischemia, hypoxia and hypoglycemia, taurine release is enhanced, together with an enhanced release of excitatory amino acids. The increase in extracellular taurine upon excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and under cell-damaging conditions may serve as an important protective mechanism against excitotoxicity, being particularly effective in the immature brain.","Development of drugs for the effective treatment of depressive disorders requires elucidation of factors that are critical for clinically antidepressant effects. During the past 4 years, we have studied in situ neurochemical alterations in the brain that may underlie depressive behavior. This was achieved using the genetically-selected Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats (a unique animal model of depression), before and after chronic antidepressant treatment. This line of rats exhibits behavioral features characteristic of depression, and responds to chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatments. This review summarizes our findings concerning the local neuro-dynamics in the brain during manifestation of depressive behavior and effective antidepressant treatment in this animal model of depression. Understanding the abnormalities manifested in neurochemical pathways during depressive disorders and the dynamic effects of these abnormalities on the onset of action and efficacy of pharmacological treatments are crucial for the development of effective antidepresssant drugs and therapeutic strategies.","The development of new axonal tract tracing and cell labelling methods has revolutionised neurobiology in the last 30 years. The aim of this review is to consider some of the key methods of neuroanatomical tracing that are currently in use and have proved invaluable in charting the complex interconnections of the central nervous system. The review begins with a short overview of the most frequently used tracers, including enzymes, peptides, biocytin, latex beads, plant lectins and the ever-increasing number of fluorescent dyes. This is followed by a more detailed consideration of both well established and more recently introduced neuroanatomical tracing methods. Technical aspects of the application, uptake mechanisms, intracellular transport of tracers, and the problems of subsequent signal detection, are also discussed. The methods that are presented and discussed in detail include: (1) anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical labelling with fluorescent dyes in vivo, (2) labelling of post mortem tissue, (3) developmental studies, (4) transcellular tracing (phagocytosis-dependent staining of glial cells), (5) electrophysiological mapping combined with neuronal tract tracing, and (6) simultaneous detection of more than one axonal tracer. (7) Versatile protocols for three-colour labelling have been developed to study complex patterns of connections. It is envisaged that this review will be used to guide the readers in their selection of the most appropriate techniques to apply to their own particular area of interest.","The cause of sleep is a complex question, which needs first, a clear distinction amongst the different meanings of a causal relationship in the study of a given behavior, second, the requisites to be met by a suggested cause, and third, a precise definition of sleep to distinguish behavioral from polygraphic sleep. This review aims at clarifying the meaning of the question and at showing the phylogenetic origin of the mammalian and avian sleep. The phylogenetic appearance of sleep can be approached through a study of the evolution of the vertebrate brain. This began as an undifferentiated dorsal nerve, which was followed by the development of an anterior simplified brain and ended with the formation of the multilayered mammalian neocortex or the avian neostriate. The successive stages in the differentiation of the vertebrate brain produced, at least, two different waking types. The oldest one is the diurnal activity, bound to the light phase of the circadian cycle. Poikilotherms control the waking from the whole brainstem, where their main sensorymotor areas lie. Mammals developed the thalamocortical lines, which displaced the waking up to the cortex after acquiring homeothermy and nocturnal lifestyle. In order to avoid competence between duplicate systems, the early waking type, controlled from the brainstem, was suppressed, and by necessity was turned into inactivity, probably slow wave sleep. On the other hand, the nocturnal rest of poikilotherms most probably resulted in rapid eye movement sleep. The complex structure of the mammalian sleep should thus be considered an evolutionary remnant; the true acquisition of mammals is the cortical waking and not the sleep.","The aim of this review is to summarise and critically evaluate studies of vestibular compensation published over the last 2 years, with emphasis on those concerned with the molecular mechanisms of this process of lesion-induced plasticity. Recent studies of vestibular compensation have confirmed and extended the previous findings that: (i) compensation of the static ocular motor and postural symptoms occurs relatively rapidly and completely compared to the dynamic symptoms, many of which either do not compensate substantially or else compensate variably due to sensory substitution and the development of sensori-motor strategies which suppress or minimize symptoms; (ii) static compensation is associated with, and may be at least partially caused by a substantial recovery of resting activity in the ipsilateral vestibular nucleus complex (VNC), which starts to develop very quickly following the unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD) but does not correlate perfectly with the development of some aspects of static compensation (e.g., postural compensation); and (iii) many complex biochemical changes are occurring in the VNC, cerebellum and even areas of the central nervous system like the hippocampus, following UVD. However, despite many recent studies which suggest the importance of excitatory amino acid receptors such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, expression of immediate early gene proteins, glucocorticoids, neurotrophins and nitric oxide in the vestibular compensation process, how these various factors are linked and which of them may have a causal relationship with the physiological changes underlying compensation, remains to be determined.","The existence of transcortical reflex pathways in the control of distal arm and hand muscles in man is now widely accepted. Much more controversy exists regarding a possible contribution of such reflexes to the control of leg muscles. It is often assumed that transcortical reflex pathways play no, or only a minor, role in the control of leg muscles. Transcortical reflex pathways according to this view are reserved for the control of the distal upper limb and are seen in close relation to the evolution of the primate hand. Here we review data, which provide evidence that transcortical reflexes do exist for lower limb muscles and may play a significant role in the control of at least some of these muscles. This evidence is based on animal research, recent experiments combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with peripheral electrical and mechanical stimulation in healthy subjects and neurological patients. We propose that afferent activity from muscle and skin may play a role in the regulation of bipedal gait through transcortical pathways.","In vivo models of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia have shown that neuronal death may occur via necrosis or apoptosis. Necrosis is, in general, a rapidly occurring form of cell death that has been attributed, in part, to alterations in ionic homeostasis. In contrast, apoptosis is a delayed form of cell death that occurs as the result of activation of a genetic program. In the past decade, we have learned considerably about the mechanisms underlying apoptotic neuronal death following cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. With this growth in knowledge, we are coming to the realization that apoptosis and necrosis, although morphologically distinct, are likely part of a continuum of cell death with similar operative mechanisms. For example, following hypoxia-ischemia, excitatory amino acid release and alterations in ionic homeostasis contribute to both necrotic and apoptotic neuronal death. However, apoptosis is distinguished from necrosis in that gene activation is the predominant mechanism regulating cell survival. Following hypoxic-ischemic episodes in the brain, genes that promote as well as inhibit apoptosis are activated. It is the balance in the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that likely determines the fate of neurons exposed to hypoxia. The balance in expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes may also account for the regional differences in vulnerability to hypoxic insults. In this review, we will examine the known mechanisms underlying apoptosis in neurons exposed to hypoxia and hypoxia-ischemia.","Neuromedin B (NMB) is one of the bombesin (BN)-related peptides in mammals. It was originally purified from pig spinal cords, and it has been shown to be present in central nervous system as well as in gastrointestinal tract. BN and its related peptides have various physiological effects. These include regulation of exocrine and endocrine secretions, smooth muscle contraction, feeding, blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature and cell growth. NMB exerts its effect by binding to the cell surface receptor. A high affinity receptor, NMB receptor (NMB-R) has been identified. This is a G-protein coupled receptor with seven membrane-spanning regions. Upon agonist binding, several intracellular signaling cascades including phospholipase activation, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation lead to expression of several genes, DNA synthesis or cellular effects such as secretion. Existence of NMB-R has been demonstrated in several brain regions, notably in olfactory and thalamic regions, and in gastrointestinal tracts. Recent analysis using NMB-R-deficient mice, generated by gene-targeting technique, enables to distinguish functional properties of NMB-R from GRP-R. In this review, molecular characterization, anatomical distribution and pharmacological properties of NMB and NMB-R will be presented. Moreover, physiological roles of NMB and its receptor demonstrated by the analysis of NMB-R-deficient mice will be reported. Comparison with GRP/GRP-R system will provide important information about BN-like peptide systems in mammals.","Although more than 8000 papers of apoptosis are published annually, there are very few reports concerning necrosis in the past few years. A number of recent studies using lower species animals have suggested that the cornu Ammonis (CA) 1 neuronal death after brief global cerebral ischemia occurs by apoptosis, an active and genetically controlled cell suicide process. However, the studies of monkeys and humans rather support necrosis, the calpain-mediated release of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin after ischemia conceivably contributes to the cell degeneration of CA1 neurons. This paper provides an overview of recent developments in ischemic neuronal death, presents the cascade of the primate neuronal death with particular attentions to the cysteine proteases, and also indicates selective cathepsin inhibitors as a novel neuroprotectant. Furthermore, the possible interaction of calpain, cathepsin, and caspase in the cascade of ischemic neuronal death is discussed.","Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons travel in radial routes unerringly toward the optic disk, their first intermediate target in the center of the eye. The path of the RGC growth cone is restricted to a narrow zone subjacent to the endfeet of Müller glial cells and the vitreal basal lamina. The present survey indicates that RGC growth cones are guided by many molecular cues along their pathway which are recognized by receptors on their surface. Growth-promoting molecules on Müller glial endfeet and in the basal lamina assist growth cones in maintaining contact with these elements. The repellant character of deeper retinal laminae discourages them from escaping the RGC axon layer. Cell adhesion/recognition proteins enable growth cones to fasciculate with preformed axons in their vicinity. It is still unclear whether the optic disk emits long range guidance components which enable the growth cones to steer toward it. Recent evidence in fish indicates the existence of an axonal receptor (neurolin) for a guidance component of unknown identity. Receptor blockade causes RGC axons to course in aberrant routes before they reach the disk. At the disk, axons receive signals to exit the retina. Contact with netrin-1 at the optic disk/nerve head encourages growth cones to turn into the nerve. This response requires the axonal netrin receptor DCC, laminin-1, beta-integrin and most likely the UNC5H netrin receptors which convert the growth encouraging signal into a repulsive one which drives growth cones into the nerve.","During the 1950s to 70s most of the mechanisms that control transmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals were described at the neuromuscular junction. It was not, however, until the 1990s that the multiplicity of protein-protein interactions that govern this process began to be identified. The sheer numbers of proteins and the complexity of their interactions at first appears excessive, even redundant. However, studies of identified central synapses indicate that this molecular diversity may underlie a important functional diversity. The task of the neuromuscular junction is to relay faithfully the rate and pattern code generated by the motoneurone. To demonstrate phenomena such as facilitation and augmentation that are apparent only when the probability of release is low, experimental manipulation is required. In the cortex, however, low probability synapses displaying facilitation can be recorded in parallel with high probability synapses displaying depression. The mechanisms are largely the same as those displayed by the neuromuscular junction, but some are differentially expressed and controlled. Central synapses demonstrate exquisitely fine tuned information transfer, each of the many types displaying its own repertoire of pattern- and frequency-dependent properties. These appear tuned to match both the discharge pattern in the presynaptic neurone and the integrative requirements of the postsynaptic cell. The molecular identification of these differentially expressed frequency filters is now just coming into sight. This review attempts to correlate these two aspects of synaptic physiology and to identify the components of the release process that are responsible for the diversity of function.","Acid and salt responses of taste cells induced by natural stimulation have not been investigated with exception of early studies with conventional microelectrode method, due to the toxicity of high concentration of salt or low pH of acid stimuli applied to isolated taste cells. This indicates that the application of rapid and localized stimulation to the apical membrane of taste cells is necessary for recording of natural responses to salt or acid stimuli using patch clamp technique. Recently we have developed a procedure to accomplish the quasi-natural condition including rapid, localized stimuli to the apical receptive membrane and the maintenance of taste bud polarity. In this review, we present our recent results obtained under quasi-natural condition using patch clamp techniques, comparing with the previously proposed hypothesis. One of our major finding is the fact that the acid-induced responses of taste cells in the mouse fungiform papillae are never suppressed by amiloride but an apical proton-gated conductance and a basolateral Cl(-) conductance possibly contribute to sour transduction. On the other hand, salt-induced responses are suppressed by amiloride, although the salt-induced responses recorded from a single cell involve both amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive components. Furthermore, the amiloride-insensitive component of salt responses possibly consists of multiple subcomponents including an apical sodium-gated nonselective cation conductance and a basolateral Cl(-) conductance. Recent reports also support the hypothesis that both acid and salt responses require specific receptor mechanisms of inorganic cations such as H(+) and Na(+) at the apical receptive membrane.","Maintenance of osmotic pressure is a primary regulatory process essential for normal cell function. The osmolarity of extracellular fluids is regulated by modifying the intake and excretion of salts and water. A major component of this regulatory process is the neuroendocrine hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, which consists of neurons located in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. These neurons synthesize the neurohormones vasopressin and oxytocin and release them in the blood circulation. We here review the mechanisms responsible for the osmoregulation of the activity of these neurons. Notably, the osmosensitivity of the supraoptic nucleus is described including the recent data that suggests an important participation of taurine in the transmission of the osmotic information. Taurine is an amino acid mainly known for its involvement in cell volume regulation, as it is one of the major inorganic osmolytes used by cells to compensate for changes in extracellular osmolarity. In the supraoptic nucleus, taurine is highly concentrated in astrocytes, and released in an osmodependent manner through volume-sensitive anion channels. Via its agonist action on neuronal glycine receptors, taurine is likely to contribute to the inhibition of neuronal activity induced by hypotonic stimuli. This inhibitory influence would complement the intrinsic osmosensitivity of supraoptic neurons, mediated by excitatory mechanoreceptors activated under hypertonic conditions. These observations extend the role of taurine from the regulation of cell volume to that of the whole body fluid balance. They also point to a new role of supraoptic glial cells as active components in a neuroendocrine regulatory loop.","The nervous system of insects is profoundly reorganised during metamorphosis, affecting the fate of different types of neuron in different ways. Almost all adult motor neurons derive from larval motor neurons that are respecified for adult functions. A subset of larval motor neurons, those which mediate larval- or ecdysis-specific behaviours, die before and immediately after eclosion, respectively. Many adult interneurons develop from larval interneurons, whereas those related to complex adult sense organs originate during larval life from persisting embryonic neuroblasts. Sensory neurons of larvae and adults derive from essentially two distinct sources. Larval sensory neurons are formed in the embryonic integument and - with few exceptions - die during metamorphosis. Their adult counterparts, on the other hand, arise from imaginal discs. Special emphasis is given in this review to the metamorphic remodelling of persisting neurons, both at the input and output levels, and to the associated behavioural changes. Other sections deal with the programmed death of motor neurons and its causes, as well as with the metamorphic interactions between motor neurons and their target muscles. Remodelling and apoptosis of these two elements appear to be under independent ecdysteroid control. This review focusses on the two most thoroughly studied holometabolous species, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta. While Manduca has a long tradition in neurodevelopmental studies due to the identification of many of its neurons, Drosophila has been increasingly used to investigate neural reorganisation thanks to neurogenetic tools and molecular approaches. The wealth of information available emphasises the strength of the insect model system used in developmental studies, rendering it clearly the most important system for studies at the cellular level.","The basal ganglia circuitry processes the signals that flow from the cortex, allowing the correct execution of voluntary movements. In Parkinson's disease, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta triggers a cascade of functional changes affecting the whole basal ganglia network. The most relevant alterations affect the output nuclei of the circuit, the medial globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, which become hyperactive. Such hyperactivity is sustained by the enhanced glutamatergic inputs that the output nuclei receive from the subthalamic nucleus. The mechanisms leading to the subthalamic disinhibition are still poorly understood. According to the current model of basal ganglia organization, the phenomenon is due to a decrease in the inhibitory control exerted over the subthalamic nucleus by the lateral globus pallidus. Recent data, however, suggest that additional if not alternative mechanisms may underlie subthalamic hyperactivity. In particular, given the reciprocal innervation of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the subthalamic nucleus, the dopaminergic deficit might influence the subthalamic activity, directly. In addition, the increased excitatory drive to the dopaminergic nigral neurons originating from the hyperactive subthalamic nucleus might sustain the progression of the degenerative process. The identification of the role of the subthalamic nucleus and, more in general, of the glutamatergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease might lead to a new approach in the pharmacological treatment of the disease. Current therapeutic strategies rely on the use of L-DOPA and/or dopamine agonists to correct the dopaminergic deficit. Drugs capable of antagonizing the effects of glutamate might represent, in the next future, a valuable tool for the development of new symptomatic and neuroprotective strategies for therapy of Parkinson's disease.","This article focuses on local protein synthesis as a basis for maintaining axoplasmic mass, and expression of plasticity in axons and terminals. Recent evidence of discrete ribosomal domains, subjacent to the axolemma, which are distributed at intermittent intervals along axons, are described. Studies of locally synthesized proteins, and proteins encoded by RNA transcripts in axons indicate that the latter comprise constituents of the so-called slow transport rate groups. A comprehensive review and analysis of published data on synaptosomes and identified presynaptic terminals warrants the conclusion that a cytoribosomal machinery is present, and that protein synthesis could play a role in long-term changes of modifiable synapses. The concept that all axonal proteins are supplied by slow transport after synthesis in the perikaryon is challenged because the underlying assumptions of the model are discordant with known metabolic principles. The flawed slow transport model is supplanted by a metabolic model that is supported by evidence of local synthesis and turnover of proteins in axons. A comparison of the relative strengths of the two models shows that, unlike the local synthesis model, the slow transport model fails as a credible theoretical construct to account for axons and terminals as we know them. Evidence for a dynamic anatomy of axons is presented. It is proposed that a distributed ""sprouting program,"" which governs local plasticity of axons, is regulated by environmental cues, and ultimately depends on local synthesis. In this respect, nerve regeneration is treated as a special case of the sprouting program. The term merotrophism is proposed to denote a class of phenomena, in which regional phenotype changes are regulated locally without specific involvement of the neuronal nucleus.","The central nervous system (CNS) is divided into diverse embryological and functional compartments. The early embryonic CNS consists of a series of transverse subdivisions (neuromeres) and longitudinal domains. These embryonic subdivisions represent histogenetic fields in which neurons are born and aggregate in distinct cell groups (brain nuclei and layers). Different subsets of these aggregates become selectively connected by nerve fiber tracts and, finally, by synapses, thus forming the neural circuits of the functional systems in the CNS. Recent work has shown that 30 or more members of the cadherin family of morphoregulatory molecules are differentially expressed in the developing and mature brain at almost all stages of development. In a regionally specific fashion, most cadherins studied to date are expressed by the embryonic subdivisions of the early embryonic brain, by developing brain nuclei, cortical layers and regions, and by fiber tracts, neural circuits and synapses. Each cadherin shows a unique expression pattern that is distinct from that of other cadherins. Experimental evidence suggests that cadherins contribute to CNS regionalization, morphogenesis and fiber tract formation, possibly by conferring preferentially homotypic adhesiveness (or other types of interactions) between the diverse structural elements of the CNS. Cadherin-mediated adhesive specificity may thus provide a molecular code for early embryonic CNS regionalization as well as for the development and maintenance of functional structures in the CNS, from embryonic subdivisions to brain nuclei, cortical layers and neural circuits, down to the level of individual synapses.","A basic concept in neuroscience is to correlate specific functions with specific neuronal structures. By discussing a specific example, an alternative concept is proposed: structures may be linked to rules of processing and these rules may serve different functions in different species or at different stages of evolution. The medial superior olive (MSO), a mammalian auditory brainstem structure, has been thought to solely process interaural time differences (ITD), the main cue for localizing low frequency sounds. Recent findings, however, indicate that this is not its only function since mammals that do not hear low frequencies and do not use ITDs for sound localization also possess a MSO. Recordings from the bat MSO indicate that it processes temporal cues in the milli- and submillisecond range, based on monaural or binaural inputs. In bats, and most likely in other small mammals, this temporal processing is related to pattern recognition and echo suppression rather than sound localization. However, the underlying mechanism, coincidence detection of several inputs, creates an epiphenomenal ITD sensitivity that is of no use for small mammals like bats or ancestral mammals. Such an epiphenomenal ITD sensitivity would have been a pre-adaptation which, when mammals grew larger during evolution and when localization of low frequency sounds became a question of survival, suddenly gained relevance. This way the MSO became involved in a new function without changing its basic rules of processing.","Hypotheses are presented of what could be specified by genes to enable the different functional architectures of the neural networks found in the brain to be built during ontogenesis. It is suggested that for each class of neuron (e.g., hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells) a small number of genes specify the generic properties of that neuron class (e.g., the number of neurons in the class, and the firing threshold), while a larger number of genes specify the properties of the synapses onto that class of neuron from each of the other classes that makes synapses with it. These properties include not only which other neuron classes the synapses come from, but whether they are excitatory or inhibitory, the nature of the learning rule implemented at the synapse, and the initial strength of such synapses. In a demonstration of the feasibility of the hypotheses to specify the architecture of different types of neuronal network, a genetic algorithm is used to allow the evolution of genotypes which are capable of specifying neural networks that can learn to solve particular computational tasks, including pattern association, autoassociation, and competitive learning. This overall approach allows such hypotheses to be further tested, improved, and extended with the help of neuronal network simulations with genetically specified architectures in order to develop further our understanding of how the architecture and operation of different parts of brains are specified by genes, and how different parts of our brains have evolved to perform particular functions.","The occurrence of neuronal death during development is well documented for some neuronal populations, such as motoneurones and dorsal root ganglion cells, whose connecting pathways are clearly defined. Cell survival is thought to be regulated largely by target and input connections, a process that serves to match the size of synaptically linked neuronal populations. Far less is known about interneurones. It is assumed that most interneurone populations are excluded from this process because their connections are more diffuse. Recent studies on the rat spinal cord have indicated that interneurone death does occur, both naturally during development and induced following peripheral nerve injury. Here the evidence for spinal interneurone death is reviewed and the factors influencing it are discussed. There are many functional types of interneurones in the spinal cord that may differ in vulnerability to cell death, but it is concluded that for most spinal interneurones the traditional view of target regulation is unlikely. Instead it is proposed that developmental interneurone death in the spinal cord forms part of a plastic response to altered sensory activation rather than a size-matching exercise. There is also emerging evidence that interneurone death may play a more direct role in some neurodegenerative diseases than hitherto considered.","Tardive dyskinesia is a serious motor side effect of long-term treatment with neuroleptics, with an unknown pathophysiologic basis. Brain damage and aging are prominent risk-factors, and together with the persistent character of the disorder, it is likely that long-lasting neuronal changes are involved in the pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that striatal neurodegeneration caused by excitotoxic mechanisms and oxidative stress may play an important role in the development of the disorder, and the scope of the present work is to review the evidence supporting this hypothesis. The rat model of tardive dyskinesia has been used extensively in the field, and the usefulness of this model will be discussed. Neuroleptics are able to induce oxidative stress in vitro and increase striatal glutamatergic activity in rats, which may lead to toxic effects in the striatum. Drugs that block excitotoxicity inhibit the development of persistent oral dyskinesia in the rat model, and impaired energy metabolism leads to increased frequency of oral dyskinesia. There are also signs of altered striatal histology in rats with high frequency of oral dyskinesia. Furthermore, markers of increased oxidative stress and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with tardive dyskinesia. In conclusion, several lines of evidence implicate neurotoxic events in the development of neuroleptic induced tardive dyskinesia.","Averaged magnetoencephalography (MEG) following somatosensory stimulation, somatosensory evoked magnetic field(s) (SEF), in humans are reviewed. The equivalent current dipole(s) (ECD) of the primary and the following middle-latency components of SEF following electrical stimulation within 80-100 ms are estimated in area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the posterior bank of the central sulcus, in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated site. Their sites are generally compatible with the homunculus which was reported by Penfield using direct cortical stimulation during surgery. SEF to passive finger movement is generated in area 3a or 2 of SI, unlike with electrical stimulation. Long-latency components with peaks of approximately 80-120 ms are recorded in the bilateral hemispheres and their ECD are estimated in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in the bilateral hemispheres. We also summarized (1) the gating effects on SEF by interference tactile stimulation or movement applied to the stimulus site, (2) clinical applications of SEF in the fields of neurosurgery and neurology and (3) cortical plasticity (reorganization) of the SI. SEF specific to painful stimulation is also recorded following painful stimulation by CO(2) laser beam. Pain-specific components are recorded over 150 ms after the stimulus and their ECD are estimated in the bilateral SII and the limbic system. We introduced a newly-developed multi (12)-channel gradiometer system with the smallest and highest quality superconducting quantum interference device (micro-SQUID) available to non-invasively detect the magnetic fields of a human peripheral nerve. Clear nerve action fields (NAFs) were consistently recorded from all subjects.","An important biological consequence of the initial interactions between the cell surface and its extracellular environment is the diversity of cellular responses ranging from overt repulsion or avoidance reaction to stable adhesion or final positioning. It is now evident that positive and negative guiding mechanisms are equally relevant to normal pattern formation during development and decisive for the outcome of a regenerative process. In this context, the present review summarizes the knowledge about the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R, a member of the tenascin gene family. In contrast to all other known family members, tenascin-R is exclusively expressed in the central nervous system of vertebrates by oligodendrocytes and neuronal subsets at later developmental stages and in adulthood. We focus on the glycoprotein's structure, tissue distribution and functional implications in the molecular control of axon targeting, neural cell adhesion, migration and differentiation during nervous system morphogenesis and pathology.","Tissue transglutaminase is a multifunctional protein that is likely to play a role in numerous processes in the nervous system. Tissue transglutaminase posttranslationally modifies proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide bound glutamines. This action results in the formation of protein crosslinks or the incorporation of polyamines into substrate proteins, modifications that likely have significant effects on neural function. Tissue transglutaminase is a unique member of the transglutaminase family as in addition to catalyzing the calcium-dependent transamidation reaction, it also binds and hydrolyzes ATP and Guanosine 5'-triphosphate and may play a role in signal transduction. Tissue transglutaminase is a highly regulated and inducible enzyme that is developmentally regulated in the nervous system. In vitro, numerous substrates of tissue transglutaminase have been identified, and several of these proteins have been shown to be in situ substrates as well. Several specific roles for tissue transglutaminase have been described and there is evidence that tissue transglutaminase may also play a role in apoptosis. Recent findings have provided evidence that dysregulation of tissue transglutaminase may contribute to the pathology of several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. In both of these diseases tissue transglutaminase and transglutaminase activity are elevated compared to age-matched controls. Further, immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that there is an increase in tissue transglutaminase reactivity in affected neurons in both Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Although intriguing, many issues remain to be addressed to definitively establish a role for tissue transglutaminase in these neurodegenerative diseases.","In addition to its cofactor activities for aromatic L-amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH(4)) shows diverse actions on neurons. Dopamine release from the rat striatum or PC12 cells was stimulated by 6R-BH(4). The action of 6R-BH(4) was independent of its cofactor activities and stereospecific. Ca(2+) channels in rat brain and PC12 cells were activated by 6R-BH(4) via cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Membrane potential of PC12 cells was deplorized by 6R-BH(4). Thus, it is assumed that 6R-BH(4) acts on its specific action site (possibly outside of the cell membrane) to stimulate dopamine release by activating Ca(2+) channels. Apoptosis induced by depletion of serum and nerve growth factor in PC12 cells was prevented by 6R-BH(4). The cell surviving effect of 6R-BH(4) was also mediated by activation of Ca(2+) channels and cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. However, since 6R-BH(4) did not activate mitogen activated protein kinase, it did not support neuronal differentiation. Nitric oxide (NO)-induced cell death was prevented by 6R-BH(4) in PC12 cells. NOS activity was not changed by exogenous 6R-BH(4), but NO metabolites in culture medium were decreased by 6R-BH(4). When endogenous 6R-BH(4) was reduced by inhibition of biosynthesis, cell death was induced in PC12 cells. Superoxide is observed to be generated during autoxidation of 6R-BH(4). Superoxide producing system mimicked the cell protective action of 6R-BH(4) against NO toxicity. Thus, it is considered that 6R-BH(4) protects PC12 cells against NO toxicity by generating superoxide during its autoxidation. These results raised the possibility that 6R-BH(4) is a self-protective factor against NO toxicity in NO producing neurons. Our findings indicate that 6R-BH(4) regulates neuronal activities in the brain and that 6R-BH(4) can be a promising drug for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.","During exercise regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), as blood velocity in major cerebral arteries and also blood flow in the internal carotid artery increase, suggesting an increase in blood flow to a large part of the brain. Such an increase in CBF is independent of the concomitant increase in blood pressure but is modified by the alteration in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO(2)). Also, the increase in middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCA V(mean)) reported with exercise appears to depend on the ability to increase cardiac output (CO), as demonstrated in response to beta-1 blockade and in patients with cardiac insufficiency or atrial fibrillation.Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) determined cerebral oxygenation supports the alterations in MCA V(mean) during exercise. Equally, the observation that the cerebrovascular CO(2)-reactivity appears to be smaller in the standing than in the sitting and especially in the supine position could relate to the progressively smaller CO. In contrast, during exercise ""global"" cerebral blood flow (gCBF), as determined by the Kety-Schmidt technique is regarded as being constant. One limitation of the Kety-Schmidt method for measuring CBF is that blood flow in the two internal jugular veins depends on the origin of drainage and it has not been defined which internal jugular venous flow is evaluated. Such a consideration is equally relevant for an evaluation of cerebral metabolism during exercise. While the regional cerebral uptake of oxygen (O(2)) increases during exercise, the global value is regarded as being constant. Yet, during high intensity exercise lactate is taken up by the brain and its O(2) uptake also increases. Furthermore, in the initial minutes of recovery immediately following exercise, brain glucose and O(2) uptake are elevated and lactate uptake remains high.A maintained substrate uptake by the brain after exercise suggests a role for brain glycogen in cerebral activation, but the fate of brain substrate uptake has not yet been determined.","Depression in the elderly is nowadays a predominant health care problem, mainly due to the progressive aging of the population. It results from psychosocial stress, polypathology, as well as some biochemical changes which occur in the aged brain and can lead to cognitive impairments, increased symptoms from medical illness, higher utilization of health care services and increased rates of suicide and nonsuicide mortality. Therefore, it is very important to make an early diagnosis and a suitable pharmacological treatment, not only for resolving the acute episode, but also for preventing relapse and enhancing the quality of life. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and in pharmacodynamics have to be kept into account before prescribing an antidepressant therapy in an old patient. In this paper some of the most important and tolerated drugs in the elderly are reviewed. Tricyclic antidepressants have to be used carefully for their important side effects. Nortriptyline, amytriptiline, clomipramine and desipramine as well, seem to be the best tolerated tricyclics in old people. Second generation antidepressants are preferred for the elderly and those patients with heart disease as they have milder side effects and are less toxic in overdose and include the so called atypicals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenalene reuptake inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are useful drugs in resistant forms of depression in which the above mentioned drugs have no efficacy; the last generation drugs (reversible MAO inhibitors), such as meclobemide, seem to be very successful. Mood stabilizing drugs are widely used for preventing recurrences of depression and for preventing and treating bipolar illness. They include lithium, which is sometimes used especially to prevent recurrence of depression, even if its use is limited in old patients for its side effects, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid. Putative last generation mood stabilizing drugs include the dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants phenytoin, lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate, which have unique mechanisms of action and also merit further systematic study. Psychotherapy is often used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, while electroconvulsant therapy is used only in the elderly patients with severe depression, high risk of suicide or drug resistant forms.","Simple animal models have allowed biologists to apply the tools of modern molecular genetics to such complex behaviors as circadian rhythms and long-term memory consolidation. The mechanisms and molecules discovered in these simple animals are evolutionarily conserved in other species, including mammals. Sleep research lacks a simple animal model because criteria based on the electroencephalogram have been met only in birds and mammals. We argue that straightforward behavioral criteria could allow the identification of a sleep-like rest state that might be useful for molecular investigations to understand the regulation and function of sleep. Candidate model systems are discussed, leading to the conclusion that several species have complementary strengths. Specifically, techniques developed for larval zebrafish can be used to visualize neural firing patterns in the living animal, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used successfully for molecular and genetic dissection of complex behaviors. We conclude with a hypothesis that one putative function of sleep, the optimization of neural plasticity, would also have adaptive value in simple organisms and might therefore be evolutionarily conserved.","Accumulating evidence indicates that grafts of embryonic neurons achieve the anatomical and functional reconstruction of damaged neuronal circuitry. The restorative capacity of grafted embryonic neural tissue is most illustrated by studies with striatal tissue transplantation in animals with striatal lesions. Striatal neurons implanted into the lesioned striatum receive some of the major striatal afferents such as the nigrostriatal dopaminergic inputs and the gluatmatergic afferents from the neocortex and thalamus. The grafted neurons also send efferents to the primary striatal targets, including the globus pallidus (GP, the rodent homologue of the external segment of the globus pallidus) and the entopeduncular nucleus (EP, the rodent homologue of the internal segment of the globus pallidus). These anatomical connections provide the reversal of the lesion-induced alterations in neuronal activities of primary and secondary striatal targets. Furthermore, intrastriatal striatal grafts improve motor and cognitive deficits seen in animals with striatal lesions. Since the grafts affect motor and cognitive behaviors that are critically dependent on the integrity of neuronal circuits of the basal ganglia, the graft-mediated recovery in these behavioral deficits is most likely attributable to the functional reconstruction of the damaged neuronal circuits. The fact that the extent of the behavioral recovery is positively correlated to the amount of grafted neurons surviving in the striatum encourages this view. Based on the animal studies, embryonic striatal tissue grafting could be a viable strategy to alleviate motor and cognitive disorders seen in patients with Huntington's disease where massive degeneration of striatal neurons occurs.","Transgenic mice expressing in brain different mutant forms of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, develop functional, cognitive and pathological defects which resemble or are reminiscent of symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The late development of amyloid plaques in aging transgenic APP mice is needed to warrant that the earlier behavioural and cognitive defects are informative for the human disorder. We describe and discuss our work, the rationale behind the approach and the techniques used to generate these APP transgenic mice, including specific experimental problems. The APP transgenic mouse models are being comprehensively characterized and offer excellent perspectives for the study and definition of early biochemical and pathological aspects that are not accessible in human AD patients. The ongoing combination by breeding with other transgenic mouse strains, i.e. mice overexpressing human Presenilin 1, ApoE 4 and protein tau to generate ""multiple"" transgenic mice, offer additional potential to define the pathological interactions of these genetic factors, known to be involved, directly or indirectly, in dementia of the Alzheimer type. Finally, it must be the aim to obtain transgenic mice that not only model amyloidogenesis, but also the neurofibrillary tangle pathology and the involvement of protein tau.","By imposing saltatory conduction on the nervous impulse, the principal role of the myelin sheath is to allow the faster propagation of action potentials along the axons which it surrounds. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin is formed by the differentiation of the plasma membrane of Schwann cells. One of the biochemical characteristics that distinguishes myelin from other biological membranes is its high lipid-to-protein ratio. All the major lipid classes are represented in the myelin membrane, while several myelin-specific proteins have been identified. During development, the presence of axons is required for the initiation of myelination, but the nature of the axonal signal is still unknown. The only certainties are that this signal is synthesized by axons whose diameter is greater than 0.7 microm, and that the signal(s) include(s) a diffusible molecule. Morphological studies have provided us with information concerning the timing of myelination, the mechanism by which immature Schwann cells differentiate into a myelinating phenotype and lay down the myelin sheath around the axon, and the accumulation and the structure of the myelin membrane. The last 20 years have seen the identification and the cDNA and gene cloning of the major PNS myelin proteins, which signalled the beginning of the knock-out decade: transgenic null-mutant mice have been created for almost every protein gene. The study of these animals shows that the formation of myelin is considerably less sensitive to molecular alterations than the maintenance of myelin. During the same period, important data has been gathered concerning the synthesis and function of lipids in PNS myelin, although this field has received relatively little attention compared with that of their protein counterparts.","Striatal neurones receive myriad of synaptic inputs originating from different sources. Massive afferents from all areas of the cortex and the thalamus represent the most important source of excitatory amino acids, whereas the nigrostriatal pathway and intrinsic circuits provide the striatum with dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, nitric oxide and adenosine. All these neurotransmitter systems interact each other and with voltage-dependent conductances to regulate the efficacy of the synaptic transmission within this nucleus. The integrative action exerted by striatal projection neurones on this converging information dictates the final output of the striatum to the other basal ganglia structures. Recent morphological, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological findings demonstrated that the striatum also contains different interneurones, whose role in physiological and pathological conditions represents an intriguing challenge in these years. The use of the in vitro brain slice preparation has allowed not only the detailed investigation of the direct pre- and postsynaptic electrophysiological actions of several neurotransmitters in striatal neurones, but also the understanding of their role in two different forms of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, long-term depression and long-term potentiation. These long-lasting changes in the efficacy of excitatory transmission have been proposed to represent the cellular basis of some forms of motor learning and are altered in animal models of human basal ganglia disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The striatum also expresses high sensitivity to hypoxic-aglycemic insults. During these pathological conditions, striatal synaptic transmission is altered depending on presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release and opposite membrane potential changes occur in projection neurones and in cholinergic interneurones. These ionic mechanisms might partially explain the selective neuronal vulnerability observed in the striatum during global ischemia and Huntington's disease.","Although evidence continues to accumulate for the apoptosis-inducing role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, several outstanding questions remain. One of these concerns the signal transduction pathway of p75, which continues to be elusive. The evidence for the roles of ceramide, c-jun kinase and NF-kappaB is discussed: none of these are able to account satisfactorily for p75 death signalling. Negative modulation of Trk signalling by p75 could account for part of the pro-apoptotic effect, but is unlikely to be a major component. Although recent evidence indicates that the juxtamembrane region is critical for causing cell death, p75 has a well-conserved death domain. This may be important for functions other than killing. In glial cells and some neurons that express p75 but not TrkA, p75 causes cell death in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) binding. In sensory neurons and PC12 cells, p75 appears to signal constitutively. In cholinergic forebrain neurons, p75 expression leads to atrophy and downregulation of cholinergic markers, rather than cell death. The major challenges in p75 research are to define its signalling pathways, and particularly the intracellular proteins with which it interacts. Another major challenge is to develop a model that reconciles the different facets of p75, such as its ability in some situations to assist TrkA to rescue NGF-dependent neurons, but to stimulate apoptosis in others.","Wind-up is a frequency-dependent increase in the excitability of spinal cord neurones, evoked by electrical stimulation of afferent C-fibres. Although it has been studied over the past thirty years, there are still uncertainties about its physiological meaning. Glutamate (NMDA) and tachykinin NK1 receptors are required to generate wind-up and therefore a positive modulation between these two receptor types has been suggested by some authors. However, most drugs capable of reducing the excitability of spinal cord neurones, including opioids and NSAIDs, can also reduce or even abolish wind-up. Thus, other theories involving synaptic efficacy, potassium channels, calcium channels, etc. have also been proposed for the generation of this phenomenon. Whatever the mechanisms involved in its generation, wind-up has been interpreted as a system for the amplification in the spinal cord of the nociceptive message that arrives from peripheral nociceptors connected to C-fibres. This probably reflects the physiological system activated in the spinal cord after an intense or persistent barrage of afferent nociceptive impulses. On the other hand, wind-up, central sensitisation and hyperalgesia are not the same phenomena, although they may share common properties. Wind-up can be an important tool to study the processing of nociceptive information in the spinal cord, and the central effects of drugs that modulate the nociceptive system. This paper reviews the physiological and pharmacological data on wind-up of spinal cord neurones, and the perceptual correlates of wind-up in human subjects, in the context of its possible relation to the triggering of hyperalgesic states, and also the multiple factors which contribute to the generation of wind-up.","Neurons, the basic information processing units of the nervous system, are characterized by a complex polar morphology which is essential for their function. To attain their precise morphology, neurons extend cytoplasmatic processes (axons and dendrites) and establish synaptic connections in a highly regulated way. Additionally, neurons are also subjected to small plastic changes at the adult stage which serve to regulate synaptic transmission. Every step of neuronal development is genetically controlled by endogenous determinants, as well as by environmental signals including intercellular contacts, extracellular matrix and diffusible signals. Cytoskeletal components are among the main protein targets modified in response to most of those extracellular signals which ultimately determine neuronal morphology. One of the major mechanisms controlling the neuronal cytoskeleton is the modification of the phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal proteins via changes in the relative activities of protein kinases and phosphatases within neurons. In particular, the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) family of proteins is an abundant group of cytoskeletal components which are predominantly expressed in neurons and serve as substrates for most of protein kinases and phosphatases present in neurons. MAP2 phosphorylation seems to control its association with the cytoskeleton and it is developmentally regulated. Moreover, MAP2 may perform many functions including the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules (and maybe microfilaments), the regulation of organelle transport within axons and dendrites, as well as the anchorage of regulatory proteins such as protein kinases which may be important for signal transduction. These putative functions of MAP2 have also been proposed to play important roles in the outgrowth of neuronal processes, synaptic plasticity and neuronal cell death. Thus, MAP2 constitutes an interesting case to understand the regulation of neuronal function by the alteration of the phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal proteins in response to different extracellular signals. Here we will review the current knowledge about the regulation of MAP2 function through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and its relevance in the broader context of neuronal functions.","The proteoglycans are multifunctional macromolecules composed of a core polypeptide and a variable number of glycosaminoglycan chains. The structural diversity and complexities of proteoglycan expression in the developing and adult Nervous System underlies the variety of biological functions that these molecules fulfill. Thus, in the Nervous System, proteoglycans regulate the structural organisation of the extracellular matrix, modulate growth factor activities and cellular adhesive and motility events, such as cell migration and axon outgrowth. This review summarises the evidences indicating that proteoglycans have an important role as modulators of neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarity. Special emphasis will be placed on those studies that have shown that proteoglycans of certain subtypes inhibit neurite extension either during the development and/or the regeneration of the vertebrate Central Nervous System.","Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a family of ligand gated ion channels which are widely distributed in the human brain. Multiple subtypes of these receptors exist, each with individual pharmacological and functional profiles. They mediate the effects of nicotine, a widely used drug of abuse, are involved in a number of physiological and behavioural processes and are additionally implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The nAChRs have a pentameric structure composed of five membrane spanning subunits, of which nine different types have thus far been identified and cloned. The multiple subunits identified provide the basis for the heterogeneity of structure and function observed in the nAChR subtypes and are responsible for the individual characteristics of each. A substantial amount of information on human nAChR structure and function has come from studies on neuroblastoma cell lines which naturally express nAChRs and from recombinant nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In vitro brain nAChR distribution can be mapped with a number of appropriate agonist and antagonist radioligands and subunit distribution may be mapped by in situ hybridization using subunit specific mRNA probes. Receptor distribution in the living human brain can be studied with noninvasive imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT, with a significant reduction in nAChRs in the brains of Alzheimer's patients having been identified with [11C] nicotine in PET studies. Despite the significant body of knowledge now accumulated about nAChRs, much remains to be elucidated. This review will attempt to describe the current knowledge on the nAChR subtypes in the human brain, their functional roles and neuropathological involvement.","Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is an integral membrane protein in vertebrate neurons. Recent evidence suggests that NTE plays an important role in neural development, possibly via involvement in a signalling pathway between neurons and glial cells. NTE is a member of a novel protein family, represented in organisms from bacteria to man. NTE comprises an N-terminal regulatory domain (with some sequence similarity to cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins) and a C-terminal catalytic domain: the latter has three predicted transmembrane segments and requires membrane-association for activity. In vitro, NTE potently catalyses hydrolysis of phenyl valerate: however, its physiological substrate is likely to be a metabolite of a much longer chain carboxylic acid, possibly associated with cell membranes. NTE was discovered originally as the primary target for those organophosphorus esters (OPs) which cause a delayed neuropathy with degeneration of long axons in peripheral nerves and spinal cord. Paradoxically, NTE's catalytic activity appears redundant in adult vertebrates. Neuropathic OPs react covalently with NTE in a rapid two-step process which not only inhibits catalytic activity but also leaves a negatively-charged OP group attached to the active site serine. The latter event is proposed to induce a toxic gain of function in NTE. OP-modified NTE somehow engenders a ""chemical transection of the axon"". In turn, this leads to calcium entry, elevation of axonal calpain activity and Wallerian-type degeneration. The net damage to peripheral nerve axons is a balance between ongoing degenerative and repair processes: the latter involve serine hydrolases which can be inhibited by the same OPs used to modify NTE.","The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, also called stress activated protein kinases. SAPKs) and p38 kinases constitute together with extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) the family of MAP kinases. Whereas the functions of JNKs under physiological conditions are largely unknown, there is raising evidence that JNKs are potent effectors of apoptosis or degeneration of neurons in vitro and in the brain. The activation of the inducible transcription factor c-Jun by N-terminal phosphorylation is a central event in JNK-mediated degenerative processes that depend on de novo protein synthesis. At the post-translational level, cytoplasmic degenerative actions of JNKs might comprise inhibition of Bcl-2 and steroid hormone-receptor signaling or hyperphosphorylation of tau; and at transcriptional level, JNKs might trigger the induction of the apoptotic effectors p53 and Fas-Ligand by phosphorylation of c-Jun. The role of p38 is the nervous system is poorly understood, but its activation is also considered as part of the neuronal stress response. This review informs about the genetic processing, the regulation of activity and the biochemical actions of JNK and p38 isoforms in general. In the second part, we summarize the findings on expression and activation of JNKs and p38 under neurodegenerative condition. A particular focus is also put on the putative function of JNK under physiological conditions and for neuroprotection.","In the vertebrate retina, it is well known that an ON/OFF dichotomy is present. In other words, ON-center and OFF-center cells participate in segregated pathways morphologically and physiologically. However, there is no doubt that integration of both channels is necessary to generate the complicated response properties of visual neurons in higher optic centers. So far, functional organization of the ON and OFF channels in the optic centers has not been demonstrated at the level of neuronal populations. In this review article, we summarize our experimental approaches to demonstrate functional organization of the ON and OFF channels using current source density (CSD) analysis in the frog optic tectum. First, we show that one-dimensional CSD analysis, assuming constant conductivity, is applicable in the tectal laminated structure. The CSD depth profile of a response to electrical stimulation of the optic tract is composed of three current sinks (A, B, and D) in the retinorecipient layers and two current sinks (C and E) below those layers. This result is in agreement with previous morphological and physiological findings, and shows that CSD analysis is very useful to demonstrate the flow of visual information processing. Second, CSD analysis of tectal responses evoked by diffuse light ON and OFF stimuli reveals obviously different distributions of synaptic activity in the laminar structure. Two or three current sinks (I, II and III) are generated in response to ON stimulation only in the retinorecipient layers, while up to six current sinks (IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX) to OFF stimulation throughout the tectal layers. Based on well known properties of retinal ganglion cells of the frog, possible neuronal mechanisms underlying each current sinks and their functional roles in visually guided behavior are considered.","The wide tissue distribution of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in organisms makes specific roles possible, although no clear physiologic function has yet been assigned to this enzyme. In vertebrates, it appears e.g. in serum, hemopoietic cells, liver, lung, heart, at cholinergic synapses, in the central nervous system. in tumors and not at least (besides acetylcholinesterase, AChE) in developing embryonic tissues. Here, a functional role of BChE can be found in regulation of cell proliferation and the onset of differentiation during early neuronal development--independent of its enzymatic activity. For studies concerning this point, we have established a strategy for a specific and efficient inhibition of BChE to investigate how the expected decrease of enzyme and, therefore, the manipulation of cellular cholinesterase-equilibrium influences embryonic neurogenesis--among others to gain information about the significance of noncholinergic, activity-independent and cell growth functions of BChE. The antisense-5'BChE-DNA strategy is based on inhibition of BChE mRNA transcription and protein synthesis. For this, the BChE gene is cloned into a suitable vector system; this is done in antisense-orientation, so that a transfected cell will produce their own antisense mRNA to inhibit gene expression. For such investigations in neurogenesis, the developing retina is a good model and we are able to create organotypic, three-dimensional retinal aggregates in vitro (retinospheroids) using isolated retinal cells of 6-day-old chicken embryos. Using this in vitro retina and ""knock out"" of BChE gene expression, we could show a key role of BChE during neurogenesis. The results are of great interest because in tumorigenesis and some neuronal disorders, the BChE gene is amplified or abnormally expressed. It has to be discussed how the antisense-5'BChE strategy can play a role in the development of new and efficient therapy forms.","This review presents an historical account of the developments of the statistical analysis of quantal transmission over the past half century and of the progress made in using this approach to reveal new properties of nerve terminals. In the early 1950s, Katz and his colleagues showed that evoked transmitter release occurred in quanta at the neuromuscular junction, opening up the study of transmitter release at nerve terminals to statistical analysis. In the subsequent two decades attempts were made to see if evoked quantal release could be described by binomial or compound binomial statistics, as originally suggested by Katz, and to relate the parameters of the statistic to various structures of the nerve terminal. During this period two hypotheses were enunciated, namely the 'vesicle hypothesis', which states that quanta arise as a consequence of the packaging of transmitter in vesicles; and the 'active zone hypothesis', which states that vesicles undergo exocytosis at discrete sites on the nerve terminal. Unsuccessful attempts were made to relate the binomial parameter n to the elements in these hypotheses, that is to the number of active zones possessed by the terminal or the number of vesicles available for release at these zones. This difficulty was part resolved in the late 1970s with the application of non-uniform binomial statistics to transmitter release from nerve terminals, in which n is the number of active zones each with their individual probabilities, p(j). Autocorrelation functions were subsequently introduced to detect if transmitter release is quantised at a particular nerve terminal. Statistical methods which would allow discrimination between different models of transmitter release over the active zones of a terminal were then developed. The introduction of maximum likelihood estimation procedures then allowed estimates to be made of the parameters in the statistical models of quantal release. The application of these procedures to experimental data from a variety of nerve terminals provided evidence for the concept that each synapse, taken as possessing a single active zone, possesses its own individual probability of secretion of a quantum by the exocytosis of a vesicle. In the late 1960s Stevens introduced the first stochastic approach to the analysis of the kinetics of the release of a quantum of transmitter at the neuromuscular junction following an impulse. In the subsequent decades this was developed into an explicit theory for the interaction of proteins involved in regulated exocytosis of a vesicle at an active zone. The parameters were the number of transition steps in the release process (k), each occurring at the same rate (alpha), with the possibility of each of these steps becoming blocked at the same rate (gamma). Maximum likelihood estimation procedures could then be used to obtain these parameter values. The discovery was made in the 1990s of the core proteins of the SNARE complex that govern regulated exocytosis. This offers the possibility in the near future of identifying the kinetic interaction of these proteins with the parameters of the stochastic process of exocytosis which confer a particular probability on individual synapses.","The myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL (VIP17/MVP17) is a proteolipid of 17 kD with a hydrophobicity pattern that indicates a four transmembrane domain structure. The MAL cDNA has been cloned from human T-cells, rat oligodendrocytes and the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. In the nervous system both myelinating cells, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, express MAL protein. MAL expression parallels myelin formation, and MAL is predominantly localized in compact myelin. Prior to myelin formation MAL is also found in immature Schwann cells. Outside the nervous system MAL expression is found in T-cells and in distinct epithelial cells, e.g. in kidney, stomach and thyroid gland, where MAL is localised in the apical plasma membrane. Specific glycosphingolipids, e.g. galactosylceramide and sulfatide, are enriched in such apical kidney and stomach membranes as well as in myelin. MAL copurifies with these glycosphingolipids in detergent insoluble domains, indicating a close association and possible functional interactions of MAL with glycosphingolipids in these tissues. Moreover, recent reports point to additional functions of MAL-glycosphingolipid complexes in signalling, cell differentiation and apical sorting. The role of MAL in the formation, stabilisation and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains and its contribution to specific membrane properties in myelin and epithelial cells are discussed.","Nitric oxide (NO) is a major signaling molecule in the immune, cardiovascular and nervous systems. The synthesizing enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) occurs in three forms: endothelial (e), neuronal (n) and inducible (i) NOS. The first two are constitutively expressed. We surmise that in many tissues there is a basal level of NO and that the actions of several signaling molecules initiate increases in cNOS-derived NO to enhance momentary basal levels that exerts inhibitory cellular actions, via cellular conformational changes. It is our contention that much of the literature concerning the actions of NO really deal with i-NOS-derived NO. We make the case that cNOS is responsible for a basal or 'tonal' level of NO; that this NO keeps particular types of cells in a state of inhibition and that activation of these cells occurs through disinhibition. Furthermore, naturally occurring signaling molecules such as morphine, anandamide, interleukin-10 and 17-beta-estradiol appear to exert, in part, their beneficial physiological actions, i.e., immune and endothelial down regulation by the stimulation of cNOS. In regard to opiates, we demonstrate the presence of a human endothelial mu opiate receptor by RT-PCR and sequence determination, further substantiating the role of opiates in vascular coupling to NO release. Taken together, cNOS derived NO enhances basal NO actions, i.e., cellular activation state, and these actions are further enhanced by iNOS derived NO.","Cationic amphiphilic drugs, in general, induce phospholipid disturbances. Tricyclic, as well as other antidepressants belong to this group. In experimental animals, antidepressants induce lipid storage disorders in cells of most organs, a so-called generalized phospholipidosis. This disorder is conveniently detected by electron microscopic examination revealing myelin figures. Myelin figures or myeloid bodies are subcellular organelles containing unicentric lamellar layers. The lipidotic induction potency during in vivo is related to the apolarity of the compound. Metabolism of phospholipids takes place within the cell continuously. Several underlying mechanisms may be responsible for the induction of the phospholipid disturbance. For instance, it has been suggested that the compounds bind to phospholipids and such binding may alter the phospholipid's suitability as a substrate for phospholipases. Free TCA or metabolites thereof may also inhibit phospholipases directly, as has been demonstrated for sphingomyelinase in glioma and neuroblastoma cells. Both these mechanisms might result in phospholipidosis. Interaction between drug and phospholipid bilayer has been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance technique. There seems to be large differences in the sensitivities amongst different organs. Steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex, testis and ovaries are in particular susceptible to drug-induced lipidosis. The so-called foam cells are lung macrophages located in the interstitium which become densely packed with myelin figures during TCA exposure. It requires about 3-6 weeks of treatment to develop this converted cell. In cell cultures however, phospholipidosis is demonstrated already after 24 h only. It appears that the cells that undergo TCA-induced lipidosis may recover after withdrawal of the drug. The time required to achieve complete recovery ranges from 3-4 weeks to several months, depending on the organ affected. Little is known about the functional significance of lipidosis. Even if TCA and other antidepressants show other effects, it has not been possible to exclusively relate it to phospholipidosis. However, few attempts have been made to correlate the physiological effects of TCAs in experimental animals to the morphological changes associated with phospholipidosis. There is an increasing evidence however, that cationic amphiphilic drugs may have effects on immune function, signal transduction and receptor-mediated events, effects that to some extent might be related to disturbances in phospholipid metabolism.","An important, and often overlooked, problem in the neurochemical approach to neurobiological problems is that analysis of tissue involves almost always a heterogeneous population of cells (neurons, glia and other types of tissue cells). The use of cell cultures has obvious limitations such as that they derive from embryonic or immediately postnatal animals; in addition, the cell culture conditions most certainly are quite different from the real tissue environment for the nerve cells. We underline here an alternative strategy, which is not new, but which, in our view, has already given formidable contributions to neurobiological studies and still is giving results of great importance. This is the technique proposed and used since the late fifties and early sixties by the senior author (H. Hydén). The method involves the isolation of the big vestibular neurons from the adult rabbit vestibular nucleus. The neurons, fully differentiated and performing a precisely defined function, are obtained rapidly and completely free from surrounding glial cells. The separate microbiochemical study of these cells and their surrounding glia has yielded already in 1962, the information that modifications in gene expression are associated with plastic modifications of the function of the relevant neurons, which take place in the behavioral event of learning. Another important concept was formulated in the same time period following determination of the activities of energy metabolism related enzymes separately in vestibular neurons and their glia under vestibular stimulation. This is the concept that, under increased functional activity glia increases its anaerobic metabolism and passes then on the resulting metabolites to the neurons for aerobic metabolism. Both these concepts (RNA and memory; metabolic cooperation between glia and neurons) are nowadays widely accepted. In addition, this approach with pure big nerve cells has allowed in recent years the discovery of a novel mechanism for chloride extrusion in these cells. This mechanism utilizes structures similar to GABA activated chloride channels in cyclic modifications resulting in the final extrusion of chloride ions. The energy for the process is provided by a protein phosphorylation step. Future approaches are warranted such as the possibility of recognizing by RT-PCR specific neuronal mRNAs and their modification in expression in relation to function and plastic modifications (learning). Another possible interesting application appears to be the recognition of the mRNAs for GABA(A) receptor subunits expressed here in these neurons in relation to the physiological and pharmacological characteristics of these native neuronal GABA(A) receptors.","There are three main mechanisms of neuronal cell death which may act separately or cooperatively to cause neurodegeneration. This lethal triplet of metabolic compromise, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress causes neuronal cell death that is both necrotic and apoptotic in nature. Aspects of each of these three mechanisms are believed to play a role in the neurodegeneration that occurs in both Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Strategies to rescue or protect injured neurons usually involve promoting neuronal growth and function or interfering with neurotoxic processes. Considerable research has been done on testing a large array of neuroprotective agents using animal models which mimic these disorders. Some of these approaches have progressed to the clinical arena. Here, we review neuroprotective strategies which have been found to successfully ameliorate the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. First, we will give an overview of the mechanisms of cell death and the background of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Then we will elaborate on a range of neuroprotective strategies, including neurotrophic factors, anti-excitotoxins, antioxidants, bioenergetic supplements, anti-apoptotics, immunosuppressants, and cell transplantation techniques. Most of these approaches hold promise as potential therapies in the treatment of these disorders.","Endothelins and endothelin receptors are widespread in the brain. There is increasing evidence that endothelins play a role in brain mechanisms associated with behaviour and neuroendocrine regulation as well as cardiovascular control. We review the evidence for an interaction of endothelin with brain dopaminergic mechanisms. Our work has shown that particularly endothelin-1 and ET(B) receptors are present at significant levels in typical brain dopaminergic regions such as the striatum. Moreover, lesion studies showed that ET(B) receptors are present on dopaminergic neuronal terminals in striatum and studies with local administration of endothelins into the ventral striatum showed that activation of these receptors causes dopamine release, as measured both with in vivo voltammetry and behavioural methods. While several previous studies have focussed on the possible role of very high levels of endothelins in ischemic and pathological mechanisms in the brain, possibly mediated by ET(A) receptors, we propose that physiological levels of these peptides play an important role in normal brain function, at least partly by interacting with dopamine release through ET(B) receptors.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. Dementia is associated with massive accumulation of fibrillary aggregates in various cortical and subcortical regions of the brain. These aggregates appear intracellularly as neurofibrillary tangles, extracellularly as amyloid plaques and perivascular amyloid in cerebral blood vessels. The causative factors in AD etiology implicate both, genetic and environmental factors. The large majority of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) cases are linked to mutations in the genes coding for presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). The corresponding proteins are 467 (PS1) and 448 (PS2) amino-acids long, respectively. Both are membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane regions. Presenilins show a high degree of conservation between species and a presenilin homologue with definite conservation of the hydrophobic structure has been identified even in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. More than 50 missense mutations in PS1 and two missense mutations in PS2 were identified which are causative for FAD. PS mutations lead to the same functional consequence as mutations on amyloid precursor protein (APP), altering the processing of APP towards the release of the more amyloidogenic form 1-42 of Abeta (Abeta42). In this regard, the physical interaction between APP and presenilins in the endoplasmic reticulum has been demonstrated and might play a key role in Abeta42 production. It was hypothesized that PS1 might directly cleave APP. However, extracellular amyloidogenesis and Abeta production might not be the sole factor involved in AD pathology and several lines of evidence support a role of apoptosis in the massive neuronal loss observed. Presenilins were shown to modify the apoptotic response in several cellular systems including primary neuronal cultures. Some evidence is accumulating which points towards the beta-catenin signaling pathways to be causally involved in presenilin mediated cell death. Increased degradation of beta-catenin has been shown in brain of AD patients with PS1 mutations and reduced beta-catenin signaling increased neuronal vulnerability to apoptosis in cell culture models. The study of presenilin physiological functions and the pathological mechanisms underlying their role in pathogenesis clearly advanced our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying the neuronal cell death and will contribute to the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of AD.","Ethanol induces alterations in the central nervous system by differentially interfering with a number of neurotransmitter systems, although the mechanisms by which such effects are executed are not well understood. The present review therefore, is designed to ascertain the effect of ethanol on both excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters, as well as the sulphonated amino acid taurine, assayed by the microdialysis technique within specific brain regions of rat during different types of alcohol intoxication, acute and chronic, as well as during the withdrawal period. Such an understanding of these pharmacological actions of ethanol on neurotransmitters is essential in order to provide the impetus for the development of appropriate therapeutic intervention to ameliorate the multitude of neurochemical disorders induced by ethanol. In addition the possible mode of action of a new therapeutic drug for the treatment of alcoholism, acamprosate will be discussed. The first part of this review will be limited to studies of the effect of ethanol on both amino acid neurotransmitters and the sulphonated amino acid taurine, a possible neuromodulator. While, the second part will seek to establish the possible mechanism of action of a new therapeutic drug, acamprosate, which is used to combat the effects of ethanol, particularly during the craving period, as well as maintaining abstinence in weaned alcoholics.","Over the past 20 years, several members of the 2,3-benzodiazepine family have been synthesized. Some of these compounds--tofisopam (Grandaxin), girisopam, nerisopam--exert significant anxiolytic and antipsychotic activities. Sites where actions of 2,3-benzodiazepines are mediated differ from those of 1,4-benzodiazepines. Binding of 2,3-benzodiazepines to neuronal cells in the central nervous system shows a unique and specific distribution pattern: their binding sites are located exclusively to the basal ganglia. Chemical lesioning of the striato-pallido-nigral system, surgical transections of the striato nigral pathway and the activation of c-fos expression in the basal ganglia after application of 2,3-benzodiazepines suggest that these compounds mainly bind to projecting neurons of the striatum. The binding sites are transported from the striatum to the substantia nigra and the entopeduncular nucleus. Recent studies on mechanism of action of 2,3-benzodiazepines indicate their possible role in opioid signal transduction since 2,3-benzodiazepines augment the agonist potency of morphine to induce catalepsy and analgesia, and their action is diminished in morphine tolerant animals. The possible biochemical target of 2,3-benzodiazepines is an alteration in the phosphorylation of protein(s) important in the signal transduction process. Agents affecting emotional responses evoked by endogenous opioids without danger of tolerance and dependence may represent a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of addiction and affective disorders.","The process of aging deeply influences morphological and functional parameters of the peripheral nerves. Interestingly, recent observations performed in our laboratory on the rat sciatic nerves have indicated that the deterioration of myelin occurring in the peripheral nerves during aging may be explained by the fall of the messenger levels of the major peripheral myelin proteins (glycoprotein Po, myelin basic protein and peripheral myelin protein 22). At least in the case of the Po, the low levels of its messengers and of the protein itself found in aged animals are increased by the treatment with a physiological progesterone derivative like dihydroprogesterone. It has also been found that in normal adult male rats the levels of the messengers for Po in the sciatic nerve are increased by progesterone, dihydroprogesterone and tetrahydroprogesterone; surprisingly, the gene expression of peripheral myelin protein 22 is stimulated only by tetrahydroprogesterone. These observations have been confirmed in parallel studies performed on Schwann cell cultures. Since tetrahydroprogesterone does not bind to the progesterone receptor but is a ligand for the GABAA receptor, the hypothesis has been put forward that part of the steroidal effects reported might occur not through the classical progesterone receptor, but rather via an interaction with the GABAA receptor. In other experiments it has been found that the gene expression of Po may be decreased by orchidectomy and restored by treatment with the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Altogether, these observations suggest the future use of physiological and/ or synthetic steroid hormones as a possible therapeutic approach for some pathological situations occurring in peripheral nerves during aging and demyelinating diseases.","Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels control electrical excitability in various peripheral and central populations of neurons. Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated or ligand-operated channels, as well as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, have been shown to induce substantial Cl- conductances that determine the response to synaptic input, spike rate, and the receptor current of various kinds of neurons. In some neurons, Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels are localized in the dendritic membrane, and their contribution to signal processing depends on the local Cl- equilibrium potential which may differ considerably from those at the membranes of somata and axons. In olfactory sensory neurons, the channels are expressed in ciliary processes of dendritic endings where they serve to amplify the odor-induced receptor current. Recent biophysical studies of signal transduction in olfactory sensory neurons have yielded some insight into the functional properties of Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels expressed in the chemosensory membrane of these cells. Ion selectivity, channel conductance, and Ca2+ sensitivity have been investigated, and the role of the channels in the generation of receptor currents is well understood. However, further investigation of neuronal Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels will require information about the molecular structure of the channel protein, the regulation of channel activity by cellular signaling pathways, as well as the distribution of channels in different compartments of the neuron. To understand the physiological role of these channels it is also important to know the Cl- equilibrium potential in cells or in distinct cell compartments that express Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels. The state of knowledge about most of these aspects is considerably more advanced in non-neuronal cells, in particular in epithelia and smooth muscle. This review, therefore, collects results both from neuronal and from non-neuronal cells with the intent of facilitating research into Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels and their physiological functions in neurons.","Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous and pleiotropic seryl/threonyl protein kinase which is highly conserved in evolution indicating a vital cellular role for this kinase. The holoenzyme is generally composed of two catalytic (alpha and/or alpha') and two regulatory (beta) subunits, but the free alpha/alpha' subunits are catalytically active by themselves and can be present in cells under some circumstances. Special attention has been devoted to phosphorylation status and structure of these enzymic molecules, however, their regulation and roles remain intriguing. Until recently, CK2 was believed to represent a kinase especially required for cell cycle progression in non-neural cells. At present, with respect to recent findings, four essential features suggest potentially important roles for this enzyme in specific neural functions: (1) CK2 is much more abundant in brain than in any other tissue; (2) there appear to be a myriad of substrates for CK2 in both synaptic and nuclear compartments that have clear implications in development, neuritogenesis, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, information storage and survival; (3) CK2 seems to be associated with mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation in hippocampus; and (4) neurotrophins stimulate activity of CK2 in hippocampus. In addition, some data are suggestive that CK2 might play a role in processes underlying progressive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, chronic alcohol exposure or immunodeficiency virus HIV. The present review focuses mainly on the latest data concerning the regulatory mechanisms and the possible neurophysiological functions of this enzyme.","Calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is required for neurotransmitter release. Recent research has characterised several pharmacologically and electrophysiologically distinct VGCC subtypes, some of which are involved in neurotransmitter release. Transmitter release from autonomic neurons can be coupled to calcium entry through N-, P/Q- and/or R-type VGCCs; the precise combination of VGCC subtypes appears to vary according to the neurotransmitter, tissue and species. L-type channels rarely appear to be important in autonomic neurotransmitter release. There does not appear to be a general rule regarding the nature of the VGCCs coupled to release of a particular transmitter in different tissues or species. Release of the same neurotransmitter from different populations of neurons often reveals a different pattern of involvement of VGCCs. Transmitters released from the same population of neurons are sometimes coupled to calcium influx through different VGCC subtypes. However, release of transmitters thought to be co-localised within vesicles is coupled to calcium influx through the same VGCCs. The role of VGCC subtypes in transmitter release can be altered by mode of nerve stimulation. Different VGCC subtypes may be coupled to transmitter release at low versus high electrical stimulation frequencies, or in response to potassium depolarization or chemical stimulation. In certain disease processes, voltage-gated calcium channels on autonomic neurons can be targeted; for example antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome downregulate VGCCs, thereby inhibiting autonomic neuroeffector transmission.","Central to infection by a majority of DNA viruses is the expression of encoded proteins that modify cell cycle. Viruses such as SV40 and Adenovirus viruses encode proteins that interact directly, or indirectly, with key cell cycle proteins such as CBP300 and the retinoblastoma gene product. However, neurons do not have a cell cycle as we generally describe it and this is also reflected in the difficulty in obtaining immortalised neuronal cultures. The replication strategies of viruses that infect post-mitotic cells such as neurons may be different from infection of other somatic cells. The life cycle for viral latency or slow infection of neurons appears to involve silencing or restricting expression of the viral genome until such times as dictated by the environment. These signals from the environment usually reflect cell stress, otherwise the cell appears to tolerate the existence of the virus genome. We will review the genomic structure of alphaherpesviruses in neurons and transcriptional control mechanisms that may regulate expression. Where appropriate we will contrast and compare virus and endogenous neuronal gene expression.","Alzheimer's disease is associated with a specific pattern of pathological changes in the brain that result in neurodegeneration and the progressive development of dementia. Pathological hallmarks common to the disease include beta-amyloid plaques, dystrophic neurites associated with plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within nerve cell bodies. The exact relationship between these pathological features has been elusive, although it is clear that beta-amyloid plaques precede neurofibrillary tangles in neocortical areas. Examination of the brains of individuals in the preclinical stage of the disease have shown that the earliest form of neuronal pathology associated with beta-amyloid plaques resembles the cellular changes that follow structural injury to axons. Thus, the development of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain may cause physical damage to axons, and the abnormally prolonged stimulation of the neuronal response to this kind of injury ultimately results in the profound cytoskeletal alterations that underlie neurofibrillary pathology and neurodegeneration. Therapeutically, inhibition of the neuronal reaction to physical trauma may be a useful neuroprotective strategy in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease.","The phenomenon of long term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, whereby a series of conditioning trains of impulses potentiate the size of synaptic potentials for periods in excess of hours, was discovered in the mammalian hippocampus by Lomo [1966, Acta Physiol. Scand. 68(Suppl. 277), 128] and subsequently characterized by Bliss and Lomo (1970, J. Physiol. 207, 61P). The search for the underlying mechanisms of LTP makes for fascinating reading. The induction of associative LTP was shown by Collingridge et al. (1982, J. Physiol. 334, 33-46) to be dependent on the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, following the discovery of these receptors by Watkins and Evans (1981, A. Rev. Pharmac. Toxic. 21, 165-204). There has, however, been continuing controversy as to whether the maintenance phase of LTP over periods of hours may be attributed to an increase in the amount of transmitter released or to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors or both. There is more agreement on the important role or protein kinases in the maintenance phase of LTP. The role of LTP in memory is just now being elucidated.","During voluntary activity in humans, motor units are exposed to a number of descending drives that tend to synchronize motor unit activity at particular frequencies. In particular, the contralateral motor cortex drives muscle discharge in the beta (15-30 Hz) and Piper (30-60 Hz) bands. The cortical activity in these bands is task-specific, somatopicly distributed and generally precedes muscle discharge by an interval appropriate for conduction in fast pyramidal pathways. Coherence between cortex and muscle in the beta band is found during isometric contractions of weak to moderate strength. Thus oscillations within the beta band seem to coincide with a stable, relatively immutable state--a free running mode of the motor cortex that may maintain stable motor output with a minimum of computational effort. In contrast, coherence between cortex and muscle in the Piper band is most evident during strong isometric contractions or during movement. Demands on the motor cortex are likely to be greater and more mutable under these circumstances. Synchronisation in the gamma band may provide a means of binding together those particular, often spatially distributed, cortical elements involved in movement execution under conditions that vary from moment to moment and require some attention. Mechanisms both intrinsic and extrinsic to the cortex determine the pattern of rhythmic cortical activity. The basal ganglia have a pivotal role in this regard, and inadequate output from these nuclei leads to a disappearance of the beta and Piper drives to muscle. This may in turn contribute to slowness and weakness in Parkinson's disease.","This review discusses the role of muscle receptors, in particular, that of muscle spindles, in the detection of movements, both passive and active. Emphasis is placed on the importance of conditioning the muscles acting at a joint before making measurements of thresholds to passive movements, to take into account muscle's thixotropic property. The detection threshold:movement velocity relation is discussed and described for a number of different joints. Implications for muscle spindles are considered from the generalisation that, when expressed in terms of proportion of muscle fascicle length change, detection thresholds are about the same at different joints. It is concluded that the available data supports the view that muscle spindles lie in parallel with only a portion of a muscle fascicle and not the whole fascicle. At the elbow joint, where it has been tested, movement detection threshold is lower during passive movements than during contraction of elbow muscles. Both peripheral mechanisms and mechanisms operating within the central nervous system may be responsible for the rise in threshold. The signalling of movements by spindles during a contraction raises the question of how the central nervous system is able to extract the length signal under such circumstances, given that there is likely to be co-activation of alpha and gamma motoneurones. The evidence for a central subtraction of fusimotor-evoked impulses and some recent experiments relevant to this idea are described. In conclusion, a number of points of uncertainly have been revealed in this area and these should be the subject of future experiments.","Neuronal development and differentiation require a variety of cell interactions. Diffusible molecules from target neurons play an important part in mediating such interactions. Our early studies used explant culture technique to examine the factors that enhance the differentiation of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons, and they revealed that several components resident in the hippocampus are involved in the differentiation of presynaptic cholinergic neurons in the medial septal nucleus. One of these components, originally purified from young rat hippocampus, is a novel undecapeptide (hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide; HCNP); this enhances the production of ChAT, but not of AchE. Later experiments revealed that: (1) a specific receptor appears to mediate this effect; (2) NGF and HCNP act cooperatively to regulate cholinergic phenotype development in the medial septal nucleus in culture; and (3) these two molecules differ both in their mechanism of release from the hippocampus and their mechanism of action on cholinergic neurons. The amino acid sequence deduced from base sequence analysis of cloned HCNP-precursor protein cDNA shows that HCNP is located at the N-terminal domain of its precursor protein. The 21 kDa HCNP precursor protein shows homology with other proteins, and it functions not only as an HCNP precursor, but also as a binding protein for ATP, opioids and phosphatidylethanolamine. The distribution and localization of HCNP-related components and the expression of their mRNAs support the notion that the precursor protein is multifunctional. In keeping with its multiple functions, the multiple enhancers and promoters found in the genomic DNA for HCNP precursor protein may be involved in the regulation of its gene in a variety of cells and at different stages of development. Furthermore, several lines of evidence obtained from studies of humans and animal models suggest that certain types of memory and learning disorders are associated with abnormal accumulation and expression of HCNP analogue peptide and/or its precursor protein mRNA in the hippocampus.","Several areas in the brainstem and forebrain are important for the modulation and expression of the sleep/wake cycle. Even if the first observations of biochemical events in relation to sleep were made only 40 years ago, it is now well established that several neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurohormones are involved in the modulation of the sleep/wake cycle. Serotonin has been known for many years to play a role in the modulation of sleep, however, it is still very controversial how and where serotonin may operate this modulation. Early studies suggested that serotonin is necessary to obtain and maintain behavioral sleep (permissive role on sleep). However, more recent microdialysis experiments provide evidence that the level of serotonin during W is higher in most cortical and subcortical areas receiving serotonergic projections. In this view the level of extracellular serotonin would be consistent with the pattern of discharge of the DRN serotonergic neurons which show the highest firing rate during W, followed by a decrease in slow wave sleep and by virtual electrical silence during REM sleep. This suggests that during waking serotonin may complement the action of noradrenaline and acetylcholine in promoting cortical responsiveness and participate to the inhibition of REM-sleep effector neurons in the brainstem (inhibitory role on REM sleep). The apparent inconsistency between an inhibitory and a facilitatory role played by serotonin on sleep has at least two possible explanations. On the one hand serotonergic modulation on the sleep/wake cycle takes place through a multitude of post-synaptic receptors which mediate different or even opposite responses; on the other hand the achievement of a behavioral state depends on the complex interaction between the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter systems. The main aim of this commentary is to review the role of brain serotonin in relation to the sleep/wake cycle. In particular we highlight the importance of microdialysis for on-line monitoring of the level of serotonin in different areas of the brain across the sleep/wake cycle.","The serotonergic neurotransmission is known as a neuromodulatory system exerting its activity in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as at the periphery. The anatomical and morphological organization of the system based on a marked centralization of the cellular bodies and the large, almost ubiquitary, presence of axonal projections of the neurons is in good agreement with this modulatory role. Furthermore, a very high number of varicosities located along the axonal branches are capable of releasing serotonin (5-HT). The amine stimulates a number of different specific receptor types which allows 5-HT to exert different activities on its various cellular targets. Among these receptors, the 5-HT1B subtypes play a particular role as they are autoreceptors located on 5-HT neurons terminals and heteroreceptors located on non-serotonergic terminals where they control the release of the neurotransmitter. 5-HT-moduline, an endogenous tetrapeptide, regulates the efficacy of these 5-HT1B receptors, hence, is able to control the serotonergic activity in a synchronous manner for the various varicosities from a single neuron and thus may favour the differential effect of that neuron on distinct cerebral functions. Accordingly, the peptide allows the 'fine tuning' of the cerebral activity by the serotonergic system to elaborate the response given by the brain to a particular stimulus, that is, stress situations. At the periphery, the serotonergic system also appears to possess a regulatory activity via 5-HT1B receptors. In particular, the receptors located on immunocompetent cells control their activity and are themselves regulated by 5-HT-moduline likely originating from adrenal medulla and released after acute stress. The serotonergic system appears to play a major role in the reciprocal signalling existing between the neuronal and the immune system. The participation of 5-HT-moduline is likely in physiological functions as well as in pathological disorders affecting central and peripheral activities.","The different types of striatal neuron show a range of vulnerabilities to a variety of insults. This can be clearly seen in Huntington's disease where a well mapped pattern of pathological events occurs. Medium spiny projection (MSP) neurons are the first striatal cells to be affected as the disease progresses whilst interneurons, in particular the NADPH diaphorase positive ones, are spared even in the late stages of the disease. The MSP neurons themselves are also differentially affected. The death of MSP neurons in the patch compartment of the striatum precedes that in the matrix compartment and the MSP neurons of the dorsomedial caudate nucleus degenerate before those in the ventral lateral putamen. The enkephalin positive striatopallidal MSP neurons are also more vulnerable than the substance P/dynorphin MSP neurons. We review the potential causes of this selective vulnerability of striatopallidal neurons and discuss the roles of endogenous glutamate, nitric oxide and calcium binding proteins. It is concluded that MSP neurons in general are especially susceptible to disruptions of cellular respiration due to the enormous amount of energy they expend on maintaining unusually high transmembrane potentials. We go on to consider a subpopulation of enkephalinergic striatopallidal neurons in the rat which are particularly vulnerable. This subpopulation of neurons readily undergo apoptosis in response to experimental manipulations which affect dopamine and/or corticosteroid levels. We speculate that the cellular mechanisms underlying this cell death may also operate in degenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease thereby imposing an additional level of selectivity on the pattern of degeneration. The possible contribution of the selective death of striatopallidal neurons to a number of clinically important psychiatric conditions including obsessive compulsive disorders and Tourette's syndrome is also discussed.","In addition to their well known roles within cells, purine nucleotides such as adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP), nucleosides such as adenosine and guanosine and bases, such as adenine and guanine and their metabolic products xanthine and hypoxanthine are released into the extracellular space where they act as intercellular signaling molecules. In the nervous system they mediate both immediate effects, such as neurotransmission, and trophic effects which induce changes in cell metabolism, structure and function and therefore have a longer time course. Some trophic effects of purines are mediated via purinergic cell surface receptors, whereas others require uptake of purines by the target cells. Purine nucleosides and nucleotides, especially guanosine, ATP and GTP stimulate incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of astrocytes and microglia and concomitant mitosis in vitro. High concentrations of adenosine also induce apoptosis, through both activation of cell-surface A3 receptors and through a mechanism requiring uptake into the cells. Extracellular purines also stimulate the synthesis and release of protein trophic factors by astrocytes, including bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3, ciliary neurotrophic factor and S-100beta protein. In vivo infusion into brain of adenosine analogs stimulates reactive gliosis. Purine nucleosides and nucleotides also stimulate the differentiation and process outgrowth from various neurons including primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and pheochromocytoma cells. A tonic release of ATP from neurons, its hydrolysis by ecto-nucleotidases and subsequent re-uptake by axons appears crucial for normal axonal growth. Guanosine and GTP, through apparently different mechanisms, are also potent stimulators of axonal growth in vitro. In vivo the extracellular concentration of purines depends on a balance between the release of purines from cells and their re-uptake and extracellular metabolism. Purine nucleosides and nucleotides are released from neurons by exocytosis and from both neurons and glia by non-exocytotic mechanisms. Nucleosides are principally released through the equilibratory nucleoside transmembrane transporters whereas nucleotides may be transported through the ATP binding cassette family of proteins, including the multidrug resistance protein. The extracellular purine nucleotides are rapidly metabolized by ectonucleotidases. Adenosine is deaminated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) and guanosine is converted to guanine and deaminated by guanase. Nucleosides are also removed from the extracellular space into neurons and glia by transporter systems. Large quantities of purines, particularly guanosine and, to a lesser extent adenosine, are released extracellularly following ischemia or trauma. Thus purines are likely to exert trophic effects in vivo following trauma. The extracellular purine nucleotide GTP enhances the tonic release of adenine nucleotides, whereas the nucleoside guanosine stimulates tonic release of adenosine and its metabolic products. The trophic effects of guanosine and GTP may depend on this process. Guanosine is likely to be an important trophic effector in vivo because high concentrations remain extracellularly for up to a week after focal brain injury. Purine derivatives are now in clinical trials in humans as memory-enhancing agents in Alzheimer's disease. Two of these, propentofylline and AIT-082, are trophic effectors in animals, increasing production of neurotrophic factors in brain and spinal cord. Likely more clinical uses for purine derivatives will be found; purines interact at the level of signal-transduction pathways with other transmitters, for example, glutamate. They can beneficially modify the actions of these other transmitters.","The present review describes gene transfer into the brain using extraneuronal cells with an ex vivo approach. The mild immunological reactions in the central nervous system to grafts provided the rationale and empirical basis for brain-transplantation, to replace dying cells, of potential clinical relevance. Fetal human astrocytes were genetically engineered to express tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of catecholamines. These cells were also found to produce constitutively and secrete GDNF and interleukins. Therefore, these cells may prove as a drug-delivery system for the treatment of neurological degenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The field of neuronal reconstruction has reached a critical threshold and there is a need to evaluate the variables that will become critical as the field matures. One of the needs is to characterize the neurochemical alterations in the microenvironment in the context of grafted-host connectivity. This review discusses the functional effects of the pharmacologically-active construct, which consists of astrocytes producing L-DOPA and GDNF. The striatum in PD that lacks the dopaminergic projection from the substantia nigra metabolizes and releases dopamine differently from normal tissue and may react to different factors released by the grafted cells. Moreover, neurochemicals of the host tissue may effect grafted cells as well. An understanding of the way in which these neurochemicals are abnormal in PD and their role in the grafted brain is critical to the improvement of reconstructive strategies using cellular therapeutic strategies.","The in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparation of newborn rats is an established model for the analysis of respiratory network functions. Respiratory activity is generated by interneurons, bilaterally distributed in the ventrolateral medulla. In particular non-NMDA type glutamate receptors constitute excitatory synaptic connectivity between respiratory neurons. Respiratory activity is modulated by a diversity of neuroactive substances such as serotonin, adenosine or norepinephrine. Cl(-)-mediated IPSPs provide a characteristic pattern of membrane potential fluctuations and elevation of the interstitial concentration of (endogenous) GABA or glycine leads to hyperpolarisation-related suppression of respiratory activity. Respiratory rhythm is not blocked upon inhibition of IPSPs with bicuculline, strychnine and saclofen. This indicates that GABA- and glycine-mediated mutual synaptic inhibition is not crucial for in vitro respiratory activity. The primary oscillatory activity is generated by neurons of a respiratory rhythm generator. In these cells, a set of intrinsic conductances such as P-type Ca2+ channels, persistent Na+ channels and G(i/o) protein-coupled K+ conductances mediates conditional bursting. The respiratory rhythm generator shapes the activity of an inspiratory pattern generator that provides the motor output recorded from cranial and spinal nerve rootlets in the preparation. Burst activity appears to be maintained by an excitatory drive due to tonic synaptic activity in concert with chemostimulation by H+. Evoked anoxia leads to a sustained decrease of respiratory frequency, related to K+ channel-mediated hyperpolarisation, whereas opiates or prostaglandins cause longlasting apnea due to a fall of cellular cAMP. The latter observations show that this in vitro model is also suited for analysis of clinically relevant disturbances of respiratory network function.","Octopamine (OA), a biogenic monoamine structurally related to noradrenaline, acts as a neurohormone, a neuromodulator and a neurotransmitter in invertebrates. It is present in relatively high concentrations in neuronal as well as in non-neuronal tissues of most invertebrate species studied. It functions as a model for the study of modulation in general. OA modulates almost every physiological process in invertebrates studied so far. Among the targets are peripheral organs, sense organs, and processes within the central nervous system. The known actions of OA in the central nervous system include desensitization of sensory inputs, influence on learning and memory, or regulation of the 'mood' of the animal. Together with tyramine, OA it is the only neuroactive non-peptide transmitter whose physiological role is restricted to invertebrates. This focussed the interest on the corresponding OA receptors. They are believed to be good targets for highly specific insecticides as they are not found in vertebrates. All octopamine receptors belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. Four of them could be distinguished using pharmacological tools. They show different coupling to second messenger systems including activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of phospholipase C and coupling to a chloride channel. Recently, octopamine receptors from molluscs and insects have been cloned. Further studies of all aspects of octopaminergic neurotransmission should give deeper insights into modulation of peripheral and sense organs and within the central nervous system in general.","The aim of this review was to try to establish the current neurophysiological knowledge capable of explaining the differences of mental functioning during the different stages of sleep and waking. The analysis focused on the cortical state. Waking is characterized by electrophysiological activities (low voltage and gamma range EEG field patterns, unitary activities) and cerebral blood flow reflecting an activated state. On the contrary, neurochemical influences are marked by inhibitory afferent processes since dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine tend, for the most part, to inhibit cortical neurons by diffuse release at the level of varicosities. During slow wave sleep, all these brain stem influences sustaining the cortical state decrease and transiently disappear just prior to onset of REM sleep. During REM sleep, pontine and mesopontine ascending activating influences invade the cortex in their turn while neurochemical inhibitory influences disappear with the exception of dopaminergic ones. We hypothesize that the activating influences acting on the cortex allow the latter to function, just as petrol makes an engine run, but that the diffuse inhibitory influences somehow regulate cortex functioning. Therefore, it is understandable that, during waking, mental activity is reflective and rational, and that psychological content is less intense during slow wave sleep. During REM sleep, the activated and mostly disinhibited state might induce the characteristic dream activity which appear to be rather ill-considered and illogical. Persistent dopaminergic input combined with the absence of noradrenergic input may induce psychological activities somewhat similar to those related to psychotic syndromes. Deactivation of part of the prefrontal cortex could contribute to this unusual mental activity.","Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary choreiform movements, cognitive decline and a progressive neuronal degeneration primarily affecting the striatum. There is at present no effective therapy against this disorder. The gene responsible for the disease (IT15) has been cloned and the molecular defect identified as an expanded polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal region of a protein of unknown function, named huntingtin (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993. Cell 72, 971-983). An intense, search for the cell pathology attached to this molecular defect is currently under way [see Sharp and Ross (1996, Neurobiol. Dis. 3, 3-15) for review]. Huntingtin interacts with a number of proteins, some of which have well identified functions, and it has thus been suggested that alterations in glycolysis, vesicle trafficking or apoptosis play a role in the physiopathology of HD. On the other hand data derived from positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance spectroscopy and post-mortem biochemical evidence for a defect in succinate oxidation have suggested the implication of a primary impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism. All these hypotheses are not necessarily to be opposed and recent findings indicate that the HD mutation could possibly directly alter mitochondrial functions which would in turn activate apoptotic pathways. To test this mitochondrial hypothesis, we studied the effects in rodents and non-human primates of a chronic blockade of succinate oxidation by systemic administration of the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). Extensive behavioural and neuropathological evaluations showed that a partial but prolonged energy impairment induced by 3NP is sufficient to replicate most of the clinical and pathophysiological hallmarks of HD, including spontaneous choreiform and dystonic movements, frontal-type cognitive deficits, and progressive heterogeneous striatal degeneration at least partially by apoptosis. 3NP produces the preferential degeneration of the medium-sized spiny GABAergic neurons with a relative sparing of interneurons and afferents, as was observed in HD striatum. The present manuscript reviews the different aspects of this neurotoxic treatment in rodents and non-human primates, and its interest as a phenotypic model of HD to understand the degenerative process of HD and test new therapeutic strategies.","Parkinson's disease remains one of the greatest challenges facing those who work in the field of neurological research. Although the development of levodopa treatment revolutionised management of this debilitating diseases, no effective long-term therapy has yet been found. With recent advances in the understanding of basal ganglia physiopathology and the experimental demonstration of the efficacy of certain surgical procedures, there is a renewed interest in the surgical approach. This paper provides a chronological overview of the history of parkinsonian surgery and discusses the principal surgical options at our disposal today. These take three main forms: ablation (thalamotomy, pallidotomy and subthalamotomy); cell graft and gene therapy (mainly in the striatum); and deep brain stimulation (of the thalamus, globus pallidus pars internalis and the subthalamic nucleus). Our knowledge of basal ganglia function and our conception of how motor information is processed by this network have evolved parallel to the development of surgical techniques. Recent results from both clinical and experimental studies underline the complexity of the physiopathological mechanisms which generate parkinsonian symptomatology and lead us to question our assumption that each class of clinical signs (tremor, akinesia, rigidity, levodopa-induced dyskinesias...) is produced by a specific and separate mechanism. In the same way, comparison of the electrophysiological and biochemical effects of the different techniques induced in brain function vary considerably. This complex world of interaction and interconnection is a labyrinth that we are still far from comprehending in its entirety. All the more reason, in consequence, for extending experimental investigation into the impact of any new therapy before proposing its clinical application.","During the development of the nervous system, a large number of neurons are eliminated through naturally occurring neuronal death. Many morphological and biochemical properties of such dying neurons are reminiscent of apoptosis, a type of death involving the action of genetically-programmed events but also epigenetic phenomena including oxidative stress. The following review contains three parts focusing respectively on basic knowledge of neuronal death and redox regulation, the mechanisms involved in neuronal death which are ordered in three sequential phases, and on the complex relations between neuronal fate and the redox status. Finally, we point out that oxidants are not always detrimental for neuronal survival. On the one hand, dying neurons often display signs of oxidative stress, including an elevation of their intracellular concentration of free radicals. Antioxidants may reduce the extent of neuronal death, suggesting a causal implication of free radicals in the death-process. On the other hand, at high concentrations antioxidants may lose their protective effects on developing neurons, and a non-lethal oxidative stress may potentiate the protective effects of other agents. These data suggest that free radicals, perhaps through their effects on cellular signalling pathways, may have positive effects on neuronal survival, provided that their intraneuronal concentrations are maintained at low levels. Much evidence suggests that the neuronal redox status must be maintained within a narrow range of values compatible with survival. Antioxidants may protect neurons subjected to an oxidative stress following axotomy or trophic factor-deprivation; but excessive reduction may become equally detrimental for neurons.","It is well known that the nucleoside adenosine exerts a modulatory influence in the central nervous system by activating G protein coupled receptors. Adenosine A2A receptors, the subject of the present review, are predominantly expressed in striatum, the major area of the basal ganglia. Activation of A2A receptors interferes with effects mediated by most of the principal neurotransmitters in striatum. In particular, the inhibitory interactions between adenosine acting on A2A receptors and dopamine acting on D2 receptors have been well examined and there is much evidence that A2A receptors may be a possible target for future development of drugs for treatment of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and affective disorders. Our understanding of the role of striatal A2A receptors has increased dramatically over the last few years. New selective antibodies, antagonist radioligands and optimized in situ hybridization protocols have provided detailed information on the distribution of A2A receptors in rodent as well as primate striatum. Studies on the involvement of A2A receptors in the regulation of DARPP-32 and the expression of immediate early genes, such as nerve growth factor-induced clone A and c-fos, have pointed out an important role for these receptors in regulating striatopallidal neurotransmission. Moreover, by using novel selective antagonists for A2A receptors and transgenic mice lacking functional A2A receptors, crucial information on the behavioral role of striatal A2A receptors has been provided, especially concerning their involvement in the stimulatory action of caffeine and the anti-Parkinsonian properties of A2A receptor antagonists. In the present review, current knowledge on the distribution, biochemistry and function of striatal A2A receptors is summarized.","Carnosine and structurally related dipeptides are a group of histidine-containing molecules widely distributed in vertebrate organisms and particularly abundant in muscle and nervous tissue. Although many theories have been proposed, the biological function(s) of these compounds in the nervous system remains enigmatic. The purpose of this article is to review the distribution of carnosine-related dipeptides in the mammalian brain, with particular reference to some cell populations wherein these molecules have been demonstrated to occur very recently. The high expression of carnosine in the mammalian olfactory receptor neurons led to infer that this dipeptide could play a role as a neurotransmitter/modulator in olfaction. This prediction, which has not yet been fully demonstrated, does not explain the localization of carnosine-related dipeptides in other cell types, such as glial and ependymal cells. A recent demonstration of high carnosine-like immunoreactivity in the subependymal layer of rodents, an area of the forebrain which shares with the olfactory neuroepithelium the occurrence of continuous neurogenesis during adulthood, supports the hypothesis that carnosine-related dipeptides could be implicated in some forms of structural plasticity. However, the particular distribution of these molecules in the subependymal layer, along with their expression in glial/ependymal cell populations, suggests that they are not directly linked to cell migration or cell renewal. In the absence of a unified theory about the role of carnosine-related dipeptides in the nervous system, some common features shared by different cell populations of the mammalian brain which contain these molecules are discussed.","The regulation of breathing relies upon chemical feedback concerning the levels of CO2 and O2. The carotid bodies, which detect O2, provide tonic excitation to brainstem respiratory neurons under normal conditions and dramatic excitation if O2 levels fall. Feedback for CO2 involves the carotid body and receptors in the brainstem, central chemoreceptors. Small increases in CO2 produce large increases in breathing. Decreases in CO2 below normal can, in sleep and anesthesia, decrease breathing, even to apnea. Central chemoreceptors, once thought localized to the surface of the ventral medulla, are likely distributed more widely with sites presently identified in the: (1) ventrolateral medulla; (2) nucleus of the solitary tract; (3) ventral respiratory group; (4) locus ceruleus; (5) caudal medullary raphé; and (6) fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum. Why so many chemoreceptor sites? Hypotheses, some with supporting data, include the following. Geographical specificity; all regions of the brainstem with respiratory neurons contain chemoreceptors. Stimulus intensity; some sites operate in the physiological range of CO2 values, others only with more extreme changes. Stimulus specificity; CO2 or pH may be sensed by multiple mechanisms. Temporal specificity; some sites respond more quickly to changes on blood or brain CO2 or pH. Syncytium; chemosensitive neurons may be connected via low resistance, gap junctions. Arousal state: sites may vary in effectiveness and importance dependent on state of arousal. Overall, as judged by experiments of nature, and in the laboratory, central chemoreceptors are critical for adequate breathing in sleep, but other aspects of the control system can maintain breathing in wakefulness.",Erratum in Prog Neurobiol 2000 Mar;60(4):407.,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels play important roles in various physiological functions such as synaptic plasticity and synapse formation underlying memory, learning and formation of neural networks during development. They are also important for a variety of pathological states including acute and chronic neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and neuropathic pain syndromes. cDNA cloning has revealed the molecular diversity of NMDA receptor channels. The identification of multiple subunits with distinct distributions, properties and regulation, implies that NMDA receptor channels are heterogeneous in their pharmacological properties, depending on the brain region and the developmental stage. Furthermore, mutation studies have revealed a critical role for specific amino acid residues in certain subunits in determining the pharmacological properties of NMDA receptor channels. The molecular heterogeneity of NMDA receptor channels as well as their dual role in physiological and pathological functions makes it necessary to develop subunit- and site-specific drugs for precise and selective therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes from a molecular perspective the recent advances in our understanding of the pharmacological properties of NMDA receptor channels with specific references to agonists binding sites, channel pore regions, allosteric modulation sites for protons, polyamines, redox agents, Zn2+ and protein kinases, phosphatases.","The discovery was made in the 1940s that calcium is required for transmitter release at synapses, raising the question of the identity of the sensor molecule upon which this calcium acts. Subsequently it was shown in the 1960s that this calcium acts on the inside of the nerve terminal. The channels which mediate the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal were identified in the 1970s. This essay is concerned with tracing the development of the concept of a calcium sensor in nerve terminals and of recent work that identifies the sensor molecule as synaptotagmin.","The present review provides an overview of the distribution of dopaminergic fibers and dopaminoceptive elements within the avian telencephalon, the possible interactions of dopamine (DA) with other biochemically identified systems as revealed by immunocytochemistry, and the involvement of DA in behavioral processes in birds. Primary sensory structures are largely devoid of dopaminergic fibers, DA receptors and the D1-related phosphoprotein DARPP-32, while all these dopaminergic markers gradually increase in density from the secondary sensory to the multimodal association and the limbic and motor output areas. Structures of the avian basal ganglia are most densely innervated but, in contrast to mammals, show a higher D2 than D1 receptor density. In most of the remaining telencephalon D1 receptors clearly outnumber D2 receptors. Dopaminergic fibers in the avian telencephalon often show a peculiar arrangement where fibers coil around the somata and proximal dendrites of neurons like baskets, probably providing them with a massive dopaminergic input. Basket-like innervation of DARPP-32-positive neurons seems to be most prominent in the multimodal association areas. Taken together, these anatomical findings indicate a specific role of DA in higher order learning and sensory-motor processes, while primary sensory processes are less affected. This conclusion is supported by behavioral findings which show that in birds, as in mammals, DA is specifically involved in sensory-motor integration, attention and arousal, learning and working memory. Thus, despite considerable differences in the anatomical organization of the avian and mammalian forebrain, the organization of the dopaminergic system and its behavioral functions are very similar in birds and mammals.","The superior colliculus (SC) is one of the most ancient regions of the vertebrate central sensory system. In this hub afferents from several sensory pathways converge, and an extensive range of neural circuits enable primary sensory processing, multi-sensory integration and the generation of motor commands for orientation behaviours. The SC has a laminar structure and is usually considered in two parts; the superficial visual layers and the deep multi-modal/motor layers. Neurones in the superficial layers integrate visual information from the retina, cortex and other sources, while the deep layers draw together data from many cortical and sub-cortical sensory areas, including the superficial layers, to generate motor commands. Functional studies in anaesthetized subjects and in slice preparations have used pharmacological tools to probe some of the SC's interacting circuits. The studies reviewed here reveal important roles for ionotropic glutamate receptors in the mediation of sensory inputs to the SC and in transmission between the superficial and deep layers. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors appear to have special responsibility for the temporal matching of retinal and cortical activity in the superficial layers and for the integration of multiple sensory data-streams in the deep layers. Sensory responses are shaped by intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms mediated by GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors and influenced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These sensory and motor-command activities of SC neurones are modulated by levels of arousal through extrinsic connections containing GABA, serotonin and other transmitters. It is possible to naturally stimulate many of the SC's sensory and non-sensory inputs either independently or simultaneously and this brain area is an ideal location in which to study: (a) interactions between inputs from the same sensory system; (b) the integration of inputs from several sensory systems; and (c) the influence of non-sensory systems on sensory processing.","Startle is a fast response to sudden, intense stimuli and probably protects the organism from injury by a predator or by a blow. The acoustic startle response (ASR) of mammals is mediated by a relatively simple neuronal circuit located in the lower brainstem. Neurons of the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) are key elements of this primary ASR pathway. The ASR in humans and animals has a non-zero baseline, that is, the response magnitude can be increased or decreased by a variety of pathological conditions and experimental manipulations. Therefore, the ASR has been used as a behavioral tool to assess the neuronal basis of behavioral plasticity and to model neuropathological dysfunctions of sensorimotor information processing. Cross-species examples for the increase of the ASR magnitude are sensitization, fear-potentiation and drug-induced enhancement. Examples for the reduction of the ASR magnitude are habituation, prepulse inhibition, drug-induced inhibition and the attenuation by positive affect. This review describes the neuronal basis underlying the mediation of the ASR, as well as the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of different phenomena of enhancement and attenuation of the ASR. It also attempts to elucidate the biological background of these forms of behavioral plasticity. Special emphasis is put on the potential relevance of ASR modulations for the understanding of human psychiatric and neurological diseases.","Xenopus frogs exhibit dramatic changes in the binocular projections to the tectum during a critical period of development. Their eyes change position in the head, moving from lateral to dorsal and creating an increasing region of binocular overlap. There is a corresponding shift of binocular projections to the tectum that keeps the two eyes' maps in register with each other throughout this period. The ipsilateral input is relayed via the nucleus isthmi. Two factors bring the ipsilateral projection into register with the contralateral projection. First, chemoaffinity cues establish a crude topographic map beginning when the shift of eye position begins. Approximately 1 month later, visual cues bring the ipsilateral map into register with the contralateral map. The role of visual input is demonstrated by the ability of the axons that bring the ipsilateral eye's map to the tectum to reorganize in response to a surgical rotation of one eye and to come into register with the contralateral eye's map. This plasticity can be blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists during the critical period. In normal adults, reorganization is minimal. Eye rotation fails to induce reorganization of the ipsilateral map. However, plasticity persists indefinitely in animals that are reared in the dark, and plasticity can be restored in normally-reared animals by treatment with NMDA. The working model to explain this plasticity posits that correlated input from the two eyes triggers opening of NMDA receptor channels and initiates events that stabilize appropriately-located isthmotectal connections. Specific tests of this model are discussed.","Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The discovery of the metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), a family of G-protein coupled receptors than can be activated by glutamate, has led to an impressive number of studies in recent years aimed at understanding their biochemical, physiological and pharmacological characteristics. The eight mGluRs now known are divided into three groups according to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms, and agonist selectivity. Group I mGluRs include mGluR1 and mGluR5, which are linked to the activation of phospholipase C; Groups II and III include all others and are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclases. The availability in recent years of agents selective for Group I mGluRs has made possible the study of the physiological roles of these receptors in the CNS. In addition to mediating glutamatergic neurotransmission, Group I mGluRs can modulate other neurotransmitter receptors, including GABA and the ionotropic glutamate receptors. Group I mGluRs are involved in many CNS functions and may participate in a variety of disorders such as pain, epilepsy, ischemia, and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. This class of receptor may provide important pharmacological therapeutic targets and elucidating its functions will be relevant to develop new treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders in which glutamatergic neurotransmission is abnormally regulated. In this review anatomical, physiological and pharmacological results are presented with a special emphasis on the role of Group I mGluRs in functional and pathological processes.","This paper focuses on the successive historical papers related to medulla oblongata (M.O.) intracerebral connections, its activities and ascending influences regulating sleep waking behavior. The M.O. certainly influences the quantitative and qualitative processes of waking. However, its neurophysiological properties are often concealed by those of the upper-situated brain stem structures. The M.O., particularly the solitary tract nucleus, is involved in sleep-inducing processes. This nucleus seem to act as a deactivating system of the above situated reticular formation, but it also impacts directly on the thalamocortical slow wave and spindle-inducing processes. The M.O. is significantly involved in paradoxical sleep mechanisms. Indeed, the mesopontine executive centers are unable to induce paradoxical sleep without the M.O. Moreover, stimulation of the solitary tract nucleus afferents can induce paradoxical sleep, and the M.O. metabolic functioning is specifically disturbed by paradoxical sleep deprivation. Finally. there seems to be a paradoxical sleep Zeitgeber. Our current knowledge shows that this lowest brain stem level is crucial for sleep waking mechanisms. It will undoubtedly be further highlighted by future electrophysiologial and neurochemical studies.","Near-infrared (IR) light easily penetrates biological tissue, and the information offered by in vivo spectroscopy of cerebral oxygenation is detailed and comes with a high temporal resolution. Near-IR light spectroscopy (NIRS) reflects cerebral oxygenation during arterial hypotension, hypoxic hypoxaemia and hypo- and hypercapnia. As determined by dual-wavelength NIRS, the cerebral O2 saturation integrates the arterial O2 content and the cerebral perfusion, and as established for skeletal muscle, NIRS obtains information on tissue oxygenation and metabolism beyond that obtained by venous blood sampling. Caveats of cerebral NIRS include insufficient light shielding, optode displacement and a sample volume including muscle or the frontal sinus mucous membrane. The relative influence from the extracranial tissue is minimized by optode separation and correction for an extracranial sample volume, or both. The natural pigment melatonin and also water are of little influence to spectroscopic analysis of cerebral oxygenation, whereas bilirubin systematically lowers ScO2 and attenuates the detection of changes in cerebral oxygenation. By NIRS, reduction of cytochrome oxidase is demonstrated during hypoxic hypoxaemia and head-up tilt-induced arterial hypotension, but the changes are small. In the clinical setting, NIRS offers useful information in patients with both systemic and local cerebral circulatory impairment, for example, during cranial trauma, surgery on the cerebral arteries, orthostasis and acute heart failure. Whereas mapping of the brain circulation is needed for jugular venous sampling to reflect either global or local oxygenation, the determination of cerebral oxygenation by NIRS has the advantage of localized monitoring of the cerebral cortex.","The strategies used by the macaca monkey brain in controlling the performance of a reaching movement to a visual target have been studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 14C-DG method. Experiments on visually intact monkeys reaching to a visual target indicate that V1 and V2 convey visuomotor information to the cortex of the superior temporal and parietoccipital sulci which may encode the position of the moving forelimb, and to the cortex in the ventral part and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus which may encode the location of the visual target. The involvement of the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus in proprioceptive guidance of movement is also suggested on the basis of the parallel metabolic effects estimated in this region and in the forelimb representations of the primary somatosensory and motor cortices. The network including the inferior postarcuate skeletomotor and prearcuate oculomotor cortical fields and the caudal periprincipal area 46 may participate in sensory-to-motor and oculomotor-to-skeletomotor transformations, in parallel with the medial and lateral intraparietal cortices. Experiments on split brain monkeys reaching to visual targets revealed that reaching is always controlled by the hemisphere contralateral to the moving forelimb whether it is visually intact or 'blind'. Two supplementary mechanisms compensate for the 'blindness' of the hemisphere controlling the moving forelimb. First, the information about the location of the target is derived from head and eye movements and is sent to the 'blind' hemisphere via inferior parietal cortical areas, while the information about the forelimb position is derived from proprioceptive mechanisms and is sent via the somatosensory and superior parietal cortices. Second, the cerebellar hemispheric extensions of vermian lobules V, VI and VIII, ipsilateral to the moving forelimb, combine visual and oculomotor information about the target position, relayed by the 'seeing' cerebral hemisphere, with sensorimotor information concerning cortical intended and peripheral actual movements of the forelimb, and then send this integrated information back to the motor cortex of the 'blind' hemisphere, thus enabling it to guide the contralateral forelimb to the target.","Immunocytochemical mapping studies employing the extensively used monoclonal anti-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antibody M35 are reviewed. We focus on three neuronal muscarinic cholinoceptive substrates, which are target regions of the cholinergic basal forebrain system intimately involved in cognitive functions: the hippocampus; neocortex; and amygdala. The distribution and neurochemistry of mAChR-immunoreactive cells as well as behaviorally induced alterations in mAChR-immunoreactivity (ir) are described in detail. M35+ neurons are viewed as cells actively engaged in neuronal functions in which the cholinergic system is typically involved. Phosphorylation and subsequent internalization of muscarinic receptors determine the immunocytochemical outcome, and hence M35 as a tool to visualize muscarinic receptors is less suitable for detection of the entire pool of mAChRs in the central nervous system (CNS). Instead, M35 is sensitive to and capable of detecting alterations in the physiological condition of muscarinic receptors. Therefore, M35 is an excellent tool to localize alterations in cellular cholinoceptivity in the CNS. M35-ir is not only determined by acetylcholine (ACh), but by any substance that changes the phosphorylation/internalization state of the mAChR. An important consequence of this proposition is that other neurotransmitters than ACh (especially glutamate) can regulate M35-ir and the cholinoceptive state of a neuron, and hence the functional properties of a neuron. One of the primary objectives of this review is to provide a synthesis of our data and literature data on mAChR-ir. We propose a hypothesis for the role of muscarinic receptors in learning and memory in terms of modulation between learning and recall states of brain areas at the postsynaptic level as studied by way of immunocytochemistry employing the monoclonal antibody M35.","Management of epilepsy in the elderly involves many challenges, including the presence of concomitant diseases, polypharmacy and changes in body physiology. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have to be taken into account in order to avoid potentially severe adverse drug reactions in elderly people. The present study reviews the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the elderly. Because some AEDs may induce the metabolism of other agents and reduce the effectiveness of several drugs, the physicians have to carefully evaluate concomitant drugs being administered. Moreover, the main problems appear to be when beginning therapy, the first choice drug, the appropriate dosage and pharmacologic compliance. Elderly patients must be screened for hepatic and renal functions before beginning a treatment with an AED, carefully interviewed to reduce complaints for drug side-effects which may negatively influence compliance and monitored for total and free blood levels. Besides the 'classic' AEDs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, valproic acid, primidone and benzodiazepines, the review shows the possible advantages of new AEDs, such as felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine and gamma-vinyl-GABA, which may be used in the elderly too for their good tolerability. A careful control of drug assumption is requested in the elderly, especially when it is difficult to achieve seizure control.","Brain atrophy in alcoholics has been identified using both radiological and pathological techniques. However the magnitude and topography of the atrophy, and the factors which contribute to it, are unclear. This review compares the results of imaging and pathological studies in alcoholics examining variables which may contribute to any discrepancies. We conclude that significant brain damage does occur as a result of alcohol abuse per se, that the damage is regionally specific with the frontal lobes being particularly affected, and that both grey matter and white matter components are damaged.","Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide originally discovered in the gastrointestinal tract but also found in high density in the mammalian brain. The C-terminal sulphated octapeptide fragment of cholecystokinin (CCK8) constitutes one of the major neuropeptides in the brain; CCK8 has been shown to be involved in numerous physiological functions such as feeding behavior, central respiratory control and cardiovascular tonus, vigilance states, memory processes, nociception, emotional and motivational responses. CCK8 interacts with nanomolar affinities with two different receptors designated CCK-A and CCK-B. The functional role of CCK and its binding sites in the brain and periphery has been investigated thanks to the development of potent and selective CCK receptor antagonists and agonists. In this review, the strategies followed to design these probes, and their use to study the anatomy of CCK pathways, the neurochemical and pharmacological properties of this peptide and the clinical perspectives offered by manipulation of the CCK system will be reported. The physiological and pathological implication of CCK-B receptor will be confirmed in CCK-B receptor deficient mice obtained by gene targeting (Nagata el al., 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 11825-11830). Moreover, CCK receptor gene structure, deletion and mutagenesis experiments, and signal transduction mechanisms will be discussed.","Cannabinoids have a long history of consumption for recreational and medical reasons. The primary active constituent of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa is delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC). In humans, psychoactive cannabinoids produce euphoria, enhancement of sensory perception, tachycardia, antinociception, difficulties in concentration and impairment of memory. The cognitive deficiencies seem to persist after withdrawal. The toxicity of marijuana has been underestimated for a long time, since recent findings revealed delta9-THC-induced cell death with shrinkage of neurons and DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus. The acute effects of cannabinoids as well as the development of tolerance are mediated by G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors. The CB1 receptor and its splice variant CB1A, are found predominantly in the brain with highest densities in the hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum. The CB2 receptor is found predominantly in the spleen and in haemopoietic cells and has only 44% overall nucleotide sequence identity with the CB1 receptor. The existence of this receptor provided the molecular basis for the immunosuppressive actions of marijuana. The CB1 receptor mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase, inhibition of N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, stimulation of potassium channels, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. The CB2 receptor mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. The discovery of endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands, anandamide (N-arachidonylethanolamine) and 2-arachidonylglycerol made the notion of a central cannabinoid neuromodulatory system plausible. Anandamide is released from neurons upon depolarization through a mechanism that requires calcium-dependent cleavage from a phospholipid precursor in neuronal membranes. The release of anandamide is followed by rapid uptake into the plasma and hydrolysis by fatty-acid amidohydrolase. The psychoactive cannabinoids increase the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area-mesolimbic pathway. Since these dopaminergic circuits are known to play a pivotal role in mediating the reinforcing (rewarding) effects of the most drugs of abuse, the enhanced dopaminergic drive elicited by the cannabinoids is thought to underlie the reinforcing and abuse properties of marijuana. Thus, cannabinoids share a final common neuronal action with other major drugs of abuse such as morphine, ethanol and nicotine in producing facilitation of the mesolimbic dopamine system.","A number of theories have proposed the involvement of different brain structures and neurotransmitters in order to explain the regulation of the sleep wake cycle. However, there is no clear consensus as to the mechanisms through which the brain structures and their various neurotransmitters interact to produce theses phases. Perhaps the problem is related to the fact sleep is a very fragile state, easily modified or influenced by a variety of substances or experimental manipulations. In this paper, we describe the evidence of two different groups of factors that induce important changes on the sleep wake cycle. The endogenous factors: neurotransmitters; hormone; peptides; and some substances of lipidic nature and exogenous factors: stress, food intake, learning, sleep deprivation, sensorial stimulation, exercise and temperature on the regulation the sleep-wake cycle. Likewise, we propose a hypothesis which attempts to reconcile the fact that endogenous and exogenous factors have similar effects.","Global cerebral ischemia in rodents is an established model in experimental research on cerebral ischemia which is characterized morphologically by a selective neuronal damage in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex. Using this model many studies have been performed to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal damage. Based upon these results it has been analysed whether substances which interact with the pathophysiological processes reduce the ischemic neuronal damage. Besides the morphological changes global ischemia leads to functional changes which can be assessed by behavioural studies. The Morris water maze examines the animals' abilities to learn, remember and go to a place in space only defined by its position relative to distal extramaze cues. In this test ischemic animals display a deficit in spatial learning as revealed by an increase in latency and in swim distance in the escape trials and a deficit in spatial memory as shown by reduced quadrant time and crossings over the former platform position during the probe trial. In several studies it could be demonstrated that neuroprotective strategies which reduce ischemic neuronal damage also attenuate or even completely prevent the ischemia-induced behavioural deficits in the water maze. Transplantation of fetal tissue which can also be used to achieve morphological recovery following global ischemia results in an amelioration of the ischemia-induced deficit. Thus, the water maze can clearly show that transplanted tissue can be functionally relevant. Data from the water maze seem to be a valuable completion to morphology which is especially important with respect to the relevance of experimental studies for clinical trials.","The basal forebrain and in particular its cholinergic projections to the cerebral cortex have long been implicated in the maintenance of cortical activation. This review summarizes evidence supporting a close link between basal forebrain neuronal activity and the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). The anatomy of basal forebrain projections and effects of acetylcholine on cortical and thalamic neurons are discussed along with the modulatory inputs to basal forebrain neurons. As both cholinergic and GABAergic basal forebrain neurons project to the cortex, identification of the transmitter specificity of basal forebrain neurons is critical for correlating their activity with the activity of cortical neurons and the EEG. Characteristics of the different basal forebrain neurons from in vitro and in vivo studies are summarized which might make it possible to identify different neuronal types. Recent evidence suggests that basal forebrain neurons activate the cortex not only tonically, as previously shown, but also phasically. Data on basal forebrain neuronal activity are presented, clearly showing that there are strong tonic and phasic correlations between the firing of individual basal forebrain cells and the cortical activity. Close analysis of temporal correlation indicates that changes in basal forebrain neuronal activity precede those in the cortex. While correlational, these data, together with the anatomical and pharmacological findings, suggest that the basal forebrain has an important role in regulating both the tonic and the phasic functioning of the cortex.","Microglia are a major ghal component of the central nervous system (CNS) and are extremely sessile. Only a subtype, the perivascular microglia, are regularly replaced from the bone marrow in adult animals. Microglia respond to virtually any, even minor pathological events in the CNS. In most pathological settings microglia are aided by infiltrating hematogenous macrophages. Upon activation microglia and macrophages share most phenotypical markers and can exert similar effector functions. After transection of a CNS fibre tract microglia are insufficiently activated and hematogenous macrophages do not significantly enter the degenerating nerve stump. Thereby myelin debris that contains neurite outgrowth inhibiting activity persists for long time. This is in sharp contrast to the peripheral nervous system in which hematogenous macrophages are rapidly recruited in response to axotomy and clear myelin debris allowing regrowth of axons from the proximal stump. However, CNS lesion paradigms with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier such as cerebral ischemia, brain abscesses and stab wounds elicit prompt microglial activation, macrophage recruitment and debris clearance. There is increasing evidence that microglia play an active part in degenerative CNS diseases. In Alzheimer's disease activated microglia appear to be involved in plaque formation. In experimental globoid cell dystrophy T-cell independent induction of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on microglia accelerates demyelination. In autoimmune diseases microglia probably have dual functions. Microglia present antigen to infiltrating T cells and exert effector functions thereby locally augmenting immune responses. On the other hand, microglia have the capacity to downregulate T cell responses. In the human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus infected macrophages probably introduce the virus to the CNS and in concert with microglia are involved in the pathophysiology of the AIDS dementia complex.","Ca2+ plays a critical role in the normal function of the central nervous system. However, it can also be involved in the development of different neuropathological and neurotoxicological processes. The processing of a Ca2+ signal requires its union with specific intracellular proteins. Calmodulin is a major Ca(2+)-binding protein in the brain, where it modulates numerous Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes and participates in relevant cellular functions. Among the different calmodulin-binding proteins, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the phosphatase calcineurin are especially important in the brain because of their abundance and their participation in numerous neuronal functions. We present an overview on different works aimed at the study of the Ca2+/calmodulin signalling system in the neural response to convulsant agents. Ca2+ and calmodulin antagonists inhibit the seizures induced by different convulsant agents, showing that the Ca2+/calmodulin signalling system plays a role in the development of the seizures induced by these agents. Processes occurring in association with seizures, such as activation of c-fos, are not always sensitive to calmodulin, but depend on the convulsant agent considered. We characterized the pattern of expression of the three calmodulin genes in the brain of control mice and detected alterations in specific areas after inducing seizures. The results obtained are in favour of a differential regulation of these genes. We also observed alterations in the expression of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and calcineurin after inducing seizures. In addition, we found that reactive microglial cells increase the expression of calmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the brain after seizures.","Studies on the reflex modulation of vertebrate locomotion have been conducted in many different laboratories and with many different preparations: for example, lamprey swimming, bird flight, quadrupedal walking in cats and bipedal walking in humans. Emerging concepts are that reflexes are task-, phase- and context-dependent. To function usefully in a behaviour such as locomotion wherein initial conditions change from step to step, reflexes would have to show modulation. Papers are reviewed in which the study of different reflexes have been conducted during different behaviours, with an emphasis on experiments in humans. A framework is developed in which the modulation and flexibility of reflexes are demonstrated. Alterations in cutaneous, and muscle (stretch and load receptor) reflexes between sitting, standing and walking are discussed. Studies in which both electrical, mechanical and 'natural' receptor activation have been conducted during walking are reviewed. Reflexes are shown to have important regulatory functions during human locomotion. A framework for discussion of reflex function throughout the step cycle is developed. The function of a given reflex pathway changes dynamically throughout the locomotor cycle. While all reflexes act in concert to a certain extent, generally cutaneous reflexes act to alter swing limb trajectory to avoid stumbling and falling. Stretch reflexes act to stabilize limb trajectory and assist force production during stance. Load receptor reflexes are shown to have an effect on both stance phase body weight support and step cycle timing. After neurotrauma or in disease, reflexes no longer function as during normal locomotion, but still have the potential to be clinically exploited in gait modification regimens.","The number of animal lectins, basically defined upon their interaction with specific carbohydrate structures, is growing considerably during the last few years. Among these proteins the recently identified subfamily of I-type lectins consists of mainly transmembranous glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Most of the I-type lectins participate in cell adhesion events, as are the different sialoadhesins recognizing sialylated glycan structures, which represent the best characterized subgroup. I-type lectins are abundant in the nervous system and have been implicated in a number of morphogenetic processes as fundamental as axon growth, myelin formation and growth factor signaling. In the present review, we summarize the structural and functional properties of I-type lectins expressed in neural tissues with a main focus on the sialoadhesin myelin-associated glycoprotein, the neural cell adhesion molecule and the fibroblast growth factor receptors.","Daily rhythms are a fundamental feature of all living organisms; most are synchronized by the 24 hr light/dark (LD) cycle. In most species, these rhythms are generated by a circadian system, and free run under constant conditions with a period close to 24 hr. To function properly the system needs a pacemaker or clock, an entrainment pathway to the clock, and one or more output signals. In vertebrates, the pineal hormone melatonin is one of these signals which functions as an internal time-keeping molecule. Its production is high at night and low during day. Evidence indicates that each melatonin producing cell of the pineal constitutes a circadian system per se in non-mammalian vertebrates. In addition to the melatonin generating system, they contain the clock as well as the photoreceptive unit. This is despite the fact that these cells have been profoundly modified from fish to birds. Modifications include a regression of the photoreceptive capacities, and of the ability to transmit a nervous message to the brain. The ultimate stage of this evolutionary process leads to the definitive loss of both the direct photosensitivity and the clock, as observed in the pineal of mammals. This review focuses on the functional properties of the cellular circadian clocks of non-mammalian vertebrates. How functions the clock? How is the photoreceptive unit linked to it and how is the clock linked to its output signal? These questions are addressed in light of past and recent data obtained in vertebrates, as well as invertebrates and unicellulars.","Overwhelming evidence indicates that the glutamate/nitric oxide (NO) synthase/soluble guanylyl cyclase system is of primary importance in a variety of physiological and pathological processes of the brain. Most of our knowledge on this neurochemical pathway derives from in vitro and ex vivo studies but the recent improvement of microdialysis techniques combined with extremely sensitive measurements of the amplified end-product cyclic GMP (cGMP) has given new impulses to the investigation of this cascade of events, its modulation by neurotransmitters and its functional relevance, in a living brain. The first reports, appeared in the early 90's, have demonstrated that microdialysis monitoring of cGMP in the extracellular environment of the cerebellum and hippocampus exactly reflects what is expected to occur at the intracellular level; thus, in vivo extracellular cGMP is sensitive to NO-synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitors, can be increased by NO-donors or phosphodiesterase blockers and is modulated by glutamate receptor stimulation in a NO-dependent fashion. Since then, other microdialysis studies have been reported showing that the brain NO synthase/guanylyl cyclase pathway is mainly controlled by NMDA, AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors but can be also influenced by other transmitters (GABA, acetylcholine, neuropeptides) through polysynaptic circuits interacting with the glutamatergic system. The available data indicate that this technique, applied to freely-moving animals and combined with behavioural tests, could be useful to get a better insight into the functional roles played by NO and cGMP in physiological and pathological situations such as learning, memory formation, epilepsy, cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.","Within the past century it has been well established that most mature neurons lose their ability to divide. Since then, it has been assumed that behavioral performance leads to synaptic changes in the brain. The existence of these potential changes has been demonstrated in numerous experiments, and different mechanisms contributing to synaptic plasticity have been discovered. Many structures involved in different types of learning have now been identified. This article reviews the different methods used with mammals to detect electrophysiological modifications in synaptic plasticity following behavior. Evidence of long-term potentiation and long-term depression has been found in the hippocampus and cerebellum, respectively, and empirical data has been used to correlate these mechanisms with specific learning performance. Similar observations were made recently in the septum and amygdala. These phenomena seem to be involved in maintaining the performance in the cortical areas of the brain. Ongoing attempts to find the relationship between behavioral performance and modifications in synaptic efficacy allow to speculate upon the dynamics of cellular mechanisms that contribute to the ability of mammals to modify wide neuronal networks in the brain during their life.","Valproate is currently one of the major antiepileptic drugs with efficacy for the treatment of both generalized and partial seizures in adults and children. Furthermore, the drug is increasingly used for therapy of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders, neuropathic pain and for prophylactic treatment of migraine. These various therapeutic effects are reflected in preclinical models, including a variety of animal models of seizures or epilepsy. The incidence of toxicity associated with the clinical use of valproate is low, but two rare toxic effects, idiosyncratic fatal hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity, necessitate precautions in risk patient populations. Studies from animal models on structure-relationships indicate that the mechanisms leading to hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity are distinct and also differ from the mechanisms of anticonvulsant action of valproate. Because of its wide spectrum of anticonvulsant activity against different seizure types, it has repeatedly been suggested that valproate acts through a combination of several mechanisms. As shown in this review, there is substantial evidence that valproate increases GABA synthesis and release and thereby potentiates GABAergic functions in some specific brain regions, such as substantia nigra, thought to be involved in the control of seizure generation and propagation. Furthermore, valproate seems to reduce the release of the epileptogenic amino acid gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and to attenuate neuronal excitation induced by NMDA-type glutamate receptors. In addition to effects on amino acidergic neurotransmission, valproate exerts direct effects on excitable membranes, although the importance of this action is equivocal. Microdialysis data suggest that valproate alters dopaminergic and serotonergic functions. Valproate is metabolized to several pharmacologically active metabolites, but because of the low plasma and brain concentrations of these compounds it is not likely that they contribute significantly to the anticonvulsant and toxic effects of treatment with the parent drug. By the experimental observations summarized in this review, most clinical effects of valproate can be explained, although much remains to be learned at a number of different levels of valproate's mechanisms of action.","Calcineurin belongs to the family of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2B. Calcineurin is the only protein phosphatase which is regulated by a second messenger, Ca2+. Furthermore, calcineurin is highly localized in the central nervous system, especially in those neurons vulnerable to ischemic and traumatic insults. For these reasons, calcineurin is considered to play important roles in neuron-specific functions. Recently, on the basis of the finding that FK506 and cyclosporin A serve as calcineurin-specific inhibitors, this enzyme has become the subject of much study. It is clear that calcineurin is involved in many neuronal (or non-neuronal) functions such as neurotransmitter release, regulation of receptor functions, signal transduction systems, neurite outgrowth, gene expression and neuronal cell death. In this review, we describe the calcineurin functions, functions of the substrates, and the pathogenesis of traumatic and ischemic insults, and we discuss the potential role of calcineurin. There are many similarities in traumatic and ischemic pathogenesis of the brain in which the release of excessive glutamate is followed by an intracellular Ca2+ increase. However, the intracellular cascade which leads to neuronal cell death after the release of excess Ca2+ is unclear. Although calcineurin is thought to be a key toxic enzyme on the basis of studies using immunosuppressants (FK506 or cyclosporin A), many of the functions of the substrates for calcineurin protect against neuronal cell death. We concluded that calcineurin is a bi-directional enzyme for neuronal cell death, having protective and toxic actions, and the balance of the bi-directional effects may be important in ischemic and traumatic pathogenesis.","Magnocellular oxytocin and vasopressin cells are among the most extensively studied neurons in the brain; their large size and high synthetic capacity, their discrete, homogeneous distribution and the anatomical separation of their terminals from their cell bodies, and the ability to determine their neuronal output readily by measurements of hormone concentration in the plasma, combine to make these systems amenable to a wide range of fundamental investigations. While vasopressin cells have intrinsic burst-generating properties, oxytocin cells are organized within local pattern-generating networks. In this review we consider the rôle played by particular afferent pathways in the regulation of the activity of oxytocin and vasopressin cells. For both cell types, the effects of changes in the activity of synaptic input can be complex.","Nitroglycerin is an organic nitrate that has been used as a vasodilator in the treatment of cardiac diseases for over a century. Only recently it has been demonstrated that the vasodilator effect of this drug depends upon the formation of nitric oxide in the blood vessel wall. However, clinical and research data gathered during the last decades have suggested that nitroglycerin possesses, besides its peripheral vasodilator effect, additional, puzzling biological activities. This organic nitrate compound provokes reflex cardiovascular activities via its interaction with the central sympathetic system. Its cerebrovascular effect, on the other hand, is probably mediated by the local release of neuropeptides. The direct application of nitroglycerin onto brain nuclei causes a prompt increase in the neuronal discharge rate. From a neurological point of view, nitroglycerin consistently induces a specific headache attack in patients suffering from migraine. Because of its temporal pattern and clinical characteristics, nitroglycerin-induced headache cannot be solely ascribed to the a drug-induced vasorelaxation. The demonstration that systemic nitroglycerin administration activates a widespread set of vegetative, nociceptive and neuroendocrine structures in the central nervous system seems to further support the occurrence of central mechanisms in the biological activity of nitroglycerin. Double labeling immunocytochemical and neuropharmacological studies have provided information on the putative neurotransmitters and neurochemical mechanisms involved in nitroglycerin-induced neuronal activation.","Lower urinary tract dysfunction is a common problem in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Since the coordination of the urinary bladder and urethra is controlled by the complex mechanisms in spinal and supraspinal neural pathways, SCI rostral to the lumbosacral level disrupts voluntary and supraspinal control of voiding and induces a considerable reorganization of the micturition reflex pathway. Following SCI, the urinary bladder is initially areflexic. but then becomes hyperreflexic because of the emergence of a spinal micturition reflex pathway. Recent electrophysiologic and histologic studies in rats have revealed that chronic SCI induces various phenotypic changes in bladder afferent neurons such as: (1) somal hypertrophy along with increased expression of neurofilament protein; and (2) increased excitability due to the plasticity of Na+ and K+ ion channels. These results have now provided detailed information to support the previous notion that capsaicin-sensitive, unmyelinated C-fiber afferents innervating the urinary bladder change their properties after SCI and are responsible for inducing bladder hyperreflexia in both humans and animals. It is also suggested that the changes in bladder reflex pathways following SCI are influenced by neural-target organ interactions probably mediated by neurotrophic signals originating in the hypertrophied bladder. Thus, increased knowledge of the plasticity in bladder afferent pathways may help to explain the pathogenesis of lower urinary tract dysfunctions after SCI and may provide valuable insights into new therapeutic strategies for urinary symptoms in spinal cord-injured patients.","Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) elicits the activation of both astrocytes and microglia. This review is focused on the principal features that characterize the activation of microglia after CNS injury. It provides a critical discussion of concepts regarding microglial biology that include the relationship between microglia and macrophages, as well as the role of microglia as immunocompetent cells of the CNS. Mechanistic and functional aspects of microgliosis are discussed primarily in the context of microglial neuronal interactions. The controversial issue of whether reactive microgliosis is a beneficial or a harmful process is addressed, and a resolution of this dilemma is offered by suggesting different interpretations of the term 'activated microglia' depending on its usage during in vivo or in vitro experimentation.","The inferior olive climbing fibre projection and associated spino-olivocerebellar paths (SOCPs) have been studied intensively over the last quarter of a century yet precisely what information they signal to the cerebellar cortex during movements remains unclear. A different approach is to consider the times during a movement when afferent signals are likely to be conveyed via these paths. Central regulation (gating) of afferent transmission during active movements is well documented in sensory pathways leading to the cerebral cortex and the present review examines the possibility that a similar phenomenon also occurs in SOCPs during movements such as locomotion and reaching. Several lines of evidence are considered which suggest that SOCPs are not always open for transmission. Instead, flow of sensory information to the cerebellum via climbing fibre paths is powerfully modulated during active movements. The findings are discussed in relation to the parasagittal zonal organization of the cerebellar cortex and, in particular, evidence is presented that different cerebellar zones are subject to similar patterns of gating during reaching but can differ appreciably in the pattern of modulation their SOCPs exhibit during locomotion. Furthermore, differences in gating can occur at different rostrocaudal loci within the same zone, suggesting that in the awake behaving animal, individual cerebellar zones are not functionally homogeneous. Finally, the data are interpreted in relation to the error detector hypothesis of climbing fibre function and the possibility explored that the gating serves as a task-dependent mechanism that operates to prevent self-generated 'irrelevant' sensory inputs from being relayed via the SOCPs to the cerebellar cortex, while behaviourally 'relevant' signals are selected for transmission.","Recently, opioid receptor like1 (ORL1) receptor was identified. The ORL1 receptor is a G protein coupled receptor and the sequence of the ORL1 receptor is closely related to that of the opioid receptors. Nociceptin/orphanin FQ has been identified as a potent endogenous agonist of the ORL1 receptor and the sequence of nociceptin/orphanin FQ is closely related to that of dynorphin A. Nociceptin/orphanin FQis not active at the classical opioid receptors, such as mu, kappa and delta receptors. The distribution of prepronociceptin mRNA is distinct from that of the opioid peptide precursor. Mice lacking the ORL1 receptor showed no significant differences in nociceptive threshold compared with wild mice. The role of nociceptin/orphanin FQ on nociceptive transmission is unclear. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of nociceptin/orphanin FQ produced hyperalgesia and allodynia and antagonized morphine analgesia. On the other hand, intrathecal injection of low dose nociceptin/orphanin FQ produces allodynia, but high dose of nociceptin/orphanin FQ produces an analgesic effect. Although we do not fully understand the mechanisms that produce the difference between the effect of i.c.v. injection of nociceptin/orphanin FQ and that of intrathecal injection of nociceptin/orphanin FQ, we believe that spinal ORL1 receptor may be the next receptor which should be targeted by drugs designed for the treatment of pain.","The phenomenon of mRNA sorting to defined subcellular domains is observed in diverse organisms such as yeast and man. It is now becoming increasingly clear that specific transport of mRNAs to extrasomal locations in nerve cells of the central and peripheral nervous system may play an important role in nerve cell development and synaptic plasticity. Although the majority of mRNAs that are expressed in a given neuron are confined to the cell somata, some transcript species are specifically delivered to dendrites and/or, albeit less frequently, to the axonal domain. The physiological role and the molecular mechanisms of mRNA compartmentalization is now being investigated extensively. Even though most of the fundamental aspects await to be fully characterized, a few interesting data are emerging. In particular, there are a number of different subcellular distribution patterns of different RNA species in a given neuronal cell type and RNA compartmentalization may differ depending on the electrical activity of nerve cells. Furthermore, RNA transport is different in neurons of different developmental stages. Considerable evidence is now accumulating that mRNA sorting, at least to dendrites and the initial axonal segment, enables local synthesis of key proteins that are detrimental for synaptic function, nerve cell development and the establishment and maintenance of nerve cell polarity. The molecular determinants specifying mRNA compartmentalization to defined microdomains of nerve cells are just beginning to be unravelled. Targeting appears to be determined by sequence elements residing in the mRNA molecule to which proteins bind in a manner to direct these transcripts along cytoskeletal components to their site of function where they may be anchored to await transcriptional activation upon demand.","Natural polyamines, spermidine and spermine, and their precursor putrescine, are of considerable importance for the developing and mature nervous system. They exhibit a number of neurophysiological and metabolic effects in the nervous system, including control of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, modulation of ionic channels and calcium-dependent transmitter release. The polyamine system is also known to be involved in various brain pathologic events (seizures, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and others). While cerebral polyamine concentrations and the activities of polyamine-metabolizing enzymes have been studied in great detail, much less is known about the cells that are responsible for cerebral polyamine synthesis and interconversion. With the present review the attempt is made to show how exact knowledge about the regional distribution and cellular localization of polyamines and the polyamine-synthesizing enzymatic machinery (and especially of L-ornithine decarboxylase) may help to better understand the functional interplay between polyamines and other endogenous agents (transmitters, receptors, growth factors neuroactive drugs etc.). Polyamines have been localized both in neurones and glial cells. However, the main cellular locus of the ODC is the neuron--both in the immature and adult central nervous system. Each period of normal brain development and ageing seems to have its own, characteristic temporo-spatial pattern of neuronal ODC expression. During strong functional activation (kindling, epileptic seizures, neural transplantation) astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells do also express ODC and other polyamine-metabolizing enzymes. Astroglial expression of ODC is accompanied by an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in these cells. This shift in the cellular mechanisms of polyamine metabolism is currently far from being understood. In human brain diseases (Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia) certain neurones show an increased expression of ODC, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine metabolism. Since polyamines are structurally related to psychoactive drugs (neuroleptics, antidepressants) the polyamine system might be of importance as a putative target for drug intervention in psychiatry.","The dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) is a distinct auditory neuronal group located ventral to the inferior colliculus (IC). It receives excitatory and inhibitory afferent inputs from various structures of the auditory lower brainstem and sends GABAergic inhibitory efferents mainly to the contralateral DNLL and the bilateral IC. The synaptic excitation in DNLL neurons consists of two components, an early fast depolarization and a later long lasting one. Glutamate is the probable excitatory neurotransmitter for DNLL neurons. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors mediate the early part of the excitation while N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate the long lasting component. The long lasting NMDA receptor-mediated component in the DNLL may contribute to a prolonged inhibition in the IC. The DNLL is thought to be a structure for processing binaural information. Most DNLL neurons in rat and bat are sensitive to interaural intensity differences (IIDs). They are excited by stimulation of the contralateral ear and inhibited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, showing an excitatory/inhibitory (EI) binaural response pattern. The EI pattern can be attributed to synaptic inputs that originate from various structures in the lower auditory brainstem and impinge on the DNLL neurons. In cat some DNLL neurons are sensitive to IIDs and some are sensitive to interaural time differences. In addition, DNLL neurons exhibit different temporal response patterns to contralateral tonal stimulation and respond to amplitude modulated tones, implying that DNLL may contribute to processing temporally complex acoustic information. DNLL neurons shape binaural responses in the contralateral inferior colliculus and auditory cortex through their inhibitory brainstem projections and contribute to the accuracy with which animals localize sounds in space.","Methods have been developed to investigate recurrent inhibition (RI) in humans. A conditioning reflex discharge is used to evoke in motoneurones (MNs) supplying homonymous and synergistic muscles, an inhibition the characteristics of which are consistent with RI: it appears and increases with the conditioning motor discharge, has a short latency and a long duration, and is enhanced by an agonist of acetylcholine. As in the cat, homonymous RI exists in all explored motor nuclei of the limbs except those of the digits and the pattern of distribution of heteronymous RI closely matches that of monosynaptic Ia excitation. However, striking inter-species differences exist concerning the distribution of heteronymous RI since it is much more widely extended in the human lower limb than in the cat hindlimb, whereas it is more restricted in the upper limb than in the cat forelimb. Changes in transmission in the recurrent pathway have been investigated during various voluntary or postural contractions involving different (homonymous, synergistic, antagonistic) muscles and it has been found that the activation of Renshaw cells (RCs) by the voluntary motor discharge via recurrent collaterals was powerfully controlled by descending tracts: for example, during homonymous contraction, RI evoked by a given conditioning reflex discharge is much smaller during strong than during weak contraction, which suggests that the descending control of RCs might contribute to the regulation of muscle force. The finding that RC inhibition is more marked during phasic than during tonic contraction of similar force of the homonymous muscle is discussed in relation with the projections of RCs to Ia interneurones mediating reciprocal inhibition. Only in patients with progressive paraparesis is there evidence for decreased RI at rest which may contribute to the exaggeration of the passively-induced stretch reflex underlying spasticity. However, despite the seemingly normal RI at rest in most patients, the control of RCs during voluntary movements is disturbed in these patients, which probably contributes to their motor disability.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a deadly outcome. AD is the leading cause of senile dementia and although the pathogenesis of this disorder is not known, various hypotheses have been developed based on experimental data accumulated since the initial description of this disease by Alois Alzheimer about 90 years ago. Most approaches to explain the pathogenesis of AD focus on its two histopathological hallmarks, the amyloid beta protein- (A(beta)-) loaded senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles, which consist of the filament protein tau. Various lines of genetic evidence support a central role of A(beta) in the pathogenesis of AD and an increasing number of studies show that oxidation reactions occur in AD and that A(beta) may be one molecular link between oxidative stress and AD-associated neuronal cell death. A(beta) itself can be neurotoxic and can induce oxidative stress in cultivated neurons. A(beta) is, therefore, one player in the concert of oxidative reactions that challenge neurons besides inflammatory reactions which are also associated with the AD pathology. Consequently, antioxidant approaches for the prevention and therapy of AD are of central interest. Experimental as well as clinical data show that lipophilic antioxidants, such as vitamin E and estrogens, are neuroprotective and may help patients suffering from AD. While an additional intensive elucidation of the cellular and molecular events of neuronal cell death in AD will, ultimately, lead to novel drug targets, various antioxidants are already available for a further exploitation of their preventive and therapeutic potential. reserved","Small rodents, mice in particular, have been widely used for genetic manipulation because of the extensive knowledge in development, embryology and other molecular aspects of this species. However, the use of mice for neurobiology research in the area of brain edema and neuronal injury has not been common. Here we summarize the studies of cold injury-induced brain edema and neuronal apoptosis using mice. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, demonstrated by extravasation of a serum albumin tracer, Evans Blue, was increased immediately after the injury and returned to the control level by 24 hr. Water content was maximized at 24 hr, whereas a secondary lesion gradually progressed up to 72 hr after cold injury. The mechanism of the development of the cold injury-induced edema and the secondary lesion, involving of oxygen radicals in particular, was determined using superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 transgenic (Tg) mice with overexpressed copper, zinc-SOD. All of the parameters, BBB permeability, water content and secondary lesion, were attenuated in the Tg mice as compared to littermate non-Tg mice. This clearly demonstrates that oxygen radicals, superoxide anion in particular, mediate cold injury. We also studied whether apoptosis contributes to brain injury following cold injury. Staining with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling showed the apoptotic cells widespread throughout the entire lesion while still remaining in the margin. DNA laddering was exhibited by gel electrophoresis. These studies indicate that oxidative mediates the development of cold injury-induced edema and the secondary injury, and induces apoptotic cell death. We believe that cold injury in mice provides a simple animal model to study the pathogenesis of brain edema and apoptosis in genetically altered animals.","Neurotrophins play a crucial role in the maintenance, survival and selective vulnerability of various neuronal populations within the normal and diseased brain. Several families of growth promoting substances have been identified within the central nervous system (CNS) including the superfamily of nerve growth factor related neurotrophin factors, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). In addition, other non-neuronal growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) have also been identified. This article reviews the trophic anatomy of these factors within the CNS. Intraventricular and intraparenchymal injections of exogenous nerve growth factor result in retrograde labeling mainly within the cholinergic basal forebrain. Distribution of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following intraventricular injection is minimal due to the binding to the trkB receptor along the ventricular wall. In contrast, intraparenchymal injections of BDNF results in widespread retrograde transport throughout the CNS. BDNF has also been shown to be transported anterogradely within the CNS. Infusion of GDNF into the CNS results in retrograde transport limited to the nigrostriatal pathway. Hippocampal injections of NT-3 retrogradely label mainly basal forebrain neurons. Retrograde transport of radiolabeled CNTF has only been observed in sensory neurons of the sciatic nerve. Following intraventricular and intraparenchymal infusion of radiolabeled bFGF, retrograde neuronal labeling was found in the telecephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and pons. In contrast retrograde labeling for aFGF was found only in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Since select neurotrophins traffic anterogradely and retrogradely within the nervous system, these proteins could be used to treat neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","This review primarily discusses work that has been performed in our laboratories and that of our direct collaborators and therefore does not represent an exhaustive review of the current literature. Our aim is to further discuss the role that gene expression plays in neuronal plasticity and pathology. In the first part of this review we examine activity-dependent changes in the expression of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) and neurotrophins with long-term potentiation (LTP) and kindling. This work has identified particular ITFs (Krox-20 and Krox-24) and neurotrophin systems (particularly the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine receptor kinase-B, Trk-B system) that may be involved in stabilizing long-lasting LTP (i.e. LTP3). We also show that changes in the expression of other ITFs (Fos, Jun-D and Krox-20) and the BDNF/trkB neurotrophin system may play a central role in the development of hippocampal kindling, an animal model of human temporal lobe epilepsy. In the next part of this review we examine changes in gene expression after neuronal injuries (ischemia, prolonged seizure activity and focal brain injury) and after nerve transection (axotomy). We identify apoptosis-related genes (p53, c-Jun, Bax) whose delayed expression selectively increases in degenerating neurons, further suggesting that some forms of neuronal death may involve apoptosis. Moreover, since overexpression of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 induces apoptosis in a wide variety of dividing cell types we speculate that it may perform the same function in post-mitotic neurons following brain injuries. Additionally, we show that neuronal injury is associated with rapid, transient, activity-dependent expression of neurotrophins (BDNF and activinA) in neurons, contrasting with a delayed and more persistent injury-induced expression of certain growth factors (IGF-1 and TGFbeta) in glia. In this section we also describe results linking ITFs and neurotrophic factor expression. Firstly, we show that while BDNF and trkB are induced as immediate-early genes following injury, the injury-induced expression of activinA and trkC may be regulated by ITFs. We also discuss whether loss of retrograde transport of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor following nerve transection triggers the selective and prolonged expression of c-Jun in axotomized neurons and whether c-Jun is responsible for regeneration or degeneration of these axotomized neurons. In the last section we further examine the role that gene expression may play in memory formation, epileptogenesis and neuronal degeneration, lastly speculating whether the expression of various growth factors after brain injury represents an endogenous neuroprotective response of the brain to injury. Here we discuss our results which show that pharmacological enhancement of this response with exogenous application of IGF-1 or TGF-beta reduces neuronal loss after brain injury.","The deltorphins are a class of highly selective delta-opioid heptapeptides from the skin of the Amazonian frogs Phyllomedusa sauvagei and P. bicolor. The first of these fascinating peptides came to light in 1987 by cloning of the cDNA of from frog skins, while the other members of this family were identified either by cDNA or isolation of the peptides. The distinctive feature of deltorphins is the presence of a naturally occurring D-enantiomer at the second position in their common N-terminal sequence, Tyr-D-Xaa-Phe, comparable to dermorphin, which is the prototype of a group of mu-selective opioids from the same source. The D-amino acid and the anionic residues, either Glu or Asp, as well as their unique amino acid compositions are responsible for the remarkable biostability, high delta-receptor affinity, bioactivity and peptide conformation. This review summarizes a decade of research from many laboratories that defined which residues and substituents in the deltorphins interact with the delta-receptor and characterized pharmacological and physiological activities in vitro and in vivo. It begins with a historical description of the topic and presents general schema for the synthesis of peptide analogues of deltorphins A, B and C as a means to document the methods employed in producing a myriad of analogues. Structure activity studies of the peptides and their pharmacological activities in vitro are detailed in abundantly tabulated data. A brief compendium of the current level of knowledge of the delta-receptor assists the reader to appreciate the rationale for the design of these analogues. Discussion of the conformation of these peptides addresses how structure leads to further hypotheses regarding ligand receptor interaction. The review ends with a broad discussion of the potential applications of these peptides in clinical and therapeutic settings.","In 1970 it was thought that if the motor-nerve supply to a muscle was interrupted and then allowed to regenerate into the muscle, motor-synaptic terminals most often formed presynaptic specializations at random positions over the surface of the constituent muscle fibres, so that the original spatial pattern of synapses was not restored. However, in the early 1970s a systematic series of experiments were carried out showing that if injury to muscles was avoided then either reinnervation or cross-reinnervation reconstituted the pattern of synapses on the muscle fibres according to an analysis using the combined techniques of electrophysiology, electronmicroscopy and histology on the muscles. It was thus shown that motor-synaptic terminals are uniquely restored to their original synaptic positions. This led to the concept of the synaptic site, defined as that region on a muscle fibre that contains molecules for triggering synaptic terminal formation. However, nerves in developing muscles were found to form connections at random positions on the surface of the very short muscle cells, indicating that these molecules are not generated by the muscle but imprinted by the nerves themselves; growth in length of the cells on either side of the imprint creates the mature synaptic site in the approximate middle of the muscle fibres. This process is accompanied at first by the differentiation of an excess number of terminals at the synaptic site, and then the elimination of all but one of the terminals. In the succeeding 25 years, identification of the synaptic site molecules has been a major task of molecular neurobiology. This review presents an historical account of the developments this century of the idea that synaptic-site formation molecules exist in muscle. The properties that these molecules must possess if they are to guide the differentiation and elimination of synaptic terminals is considered in the context of a quantitative model of this process termed the dual-constraint hypothesis. It is suggested that the molecules agrin, ARIA, MuSK and S-laminin have suitable properties according to the dual-constraint hypothesis to subserve this purpose. The extent to which there is evidence for similar molecules at neuronal synapses such as those in autonomic ganglia is also considered.","The goal of this review is to give a detailed description of the main results obtained in the field of learning-induced plasticity. The review is focused on receptive field and map changes observed in the auditory, somatosensory and visual thalamo-cortical system as a result of an associative training performed in waking animals. Receptive field (RF) plasticity, 2DG and map changes obtained in the auditory and somatosensory system are reviewed. In the visual system, as there is no RF and map analysis during learning per se, the evidence presented are from increased neuronal responsiveness, and from the effects of perceptual learning in human and non human primates. Across sensory modalities, the re-tuning of neurons to a significant stimulus or map reorganizations in favour of the significant stimuli were observed at the thalamic and/or cortical level. The analysis of the literature in each sensory modality indicates that relationships between learning-induced sensory plasticity and behavioural performance can, or cannot, be found depending on the tasks that were used. The involvement (i) of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in the described neuronal changes and (ii) of neuromodulators as ""gating"" factors of the neuronal changes, is evaluated. The weakness of the Hebbian schema to explain learning-induced changes and the need to better define what the word ""learning"" means are stressed. It is suggested that future research should focus on the dynamic of information processing in sensory systems, and the concept of ""effective connectivity"" should be useful in that matter.","The highly disagreeable sensation of pain results from an extraordinarily complex and interactive series of mechanisms integrated at all levels of the neuroaxis, from the periphery, via the dorsal horn to higher cerebral structures. Pain is usually elicited by the activation of specific nociceptors ('nociceptive pain'). However, it may also result from injury to sensory fibres, or from damage to the CNS itself ('neuropathic pain'). Although acute and subchronic, nociceptive pain fulfils a warning role, chronic and/or severe nociceptive and neuropathic pain is maladaptive. Recent years have seen a progressive unravelling of the neuroanatomical circuits and cellular mechanisms underlying the induction of pain. In addition to familiar inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and bradykinin, potentially-important, pronociceptive roles have been proposed for a variety of 'exotic' species, including protons, ATP, cytokines, neurotrophins (growth factors) and nitric oxide. Further, both in the periphery and in the CNS, non-neuronal glial and immunecompetent cells have been shown to play a modulatory role in the response to inflammation and injury, and in processes modifying nociception. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, wherein the primary processing of nociceptive information occurs, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are activated by glutamate released from nocisponsive afferent fibres. Their activation plays a key role in the induction of neuronal sensitization, a process underlying prolonged painful states. In addition, upon peripheral nerve injury, a reduction of inhibitory interneurone tone in the dorsal horn exacerbates sensitized states and further enhance nociception. As concerns the transfer of nociceptive information to the brain, several pathways other than the classical spinothalamic tract are of importance: for example, the postsynaptic dorsal column pathway. In discussing the roles of supraspinal structures in pain sensation, differences between its 'discriminative-sensory' and 'affective-cognitive' dimensions should be emphasized. The purpose of the present article is to provide a global account of mechanisms involved in the induction of pain. Particular attention is focused on cellular aspects and on the consequences of peripheral nerve injury. In the first part of the review, neuronal pathways for the transmission of nociceptive information from peripheral nerve terminals to the dorsal horn, and therefrom to higher centres, are outlined. This neuronal framework is then exploited for a consideration of peripheral, spinal and supraspinal mechanisms involved in the induction of pain by stimulation of peripheral nociceptors, by peripheral nerve injury and by damage to the CNS itself. Finally, a hypothesis is forwarded that neurotrophins may play an important role in central, adaptive mechanisms modulating nociception. An improved understanding of the origins of pain should facilitate the development of novel strategies for its more effective treatment.","This review gives an overview of recent findings and developments in research on brain mechanisms of reward and reinforcement from studies using the place preference conditioning paradigm, with emphasis on those studies that have been published within the last decade. Methodological issues of the paradigm (such as design of the conditioning apparatus, biased vs unbiased conditioning, state dependency effects) are discussed. Results from studies using systemic and local (intracranial) drug administration, natural reinforcers, and non-drug treatments and from studies examining the effects of lesions are presented. Papers reporting on conditioned place aversion (CPA) experiments are also included. A special emphasis is put on the issue of tolerance and sensitization to the rewarding properties of drugs. Transmitter systems that have been investigated with respect to their involvement in brain reward mechanisms include dopamine, opioids, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, glutamate, substance P, and cholecystokinin, the motivational significance of which has been examined either directly, by using respective agonist or antagonist drugs, or indirectly, by studying the effects of these drugs on the reward induced by other drugs. For a number of these transmitters, detailed studies have been conducted to delineate the receptor subtype(s) responsible for the mediation of the observed drug effects, particularly in the case of dopamine, the opioids, serotonin and glutamate. Brain sites that have been implicated in the mediation of drug-induced place conditioning include the 'traditional' brain reward sites, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, but the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral pallidum, amygdala and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus have also been shown to play important roles in the mediation of place conditioning induced by drugs or natural reinforcers. Thus, although the paradigm has also been criticized because of some inherent methodological problems, it is clear that during the past decade place preference conditioning has become a valuable and firmly established and very widely used tool in behavioural pharmacology and addiction research.","Several pharmacological and neurochemical conditions in rats induce 'vacuous' or 'tremulous' jaw movements. Although the clinical significance of these movements has been a subject of some debate, considerable evidence indicates that the non-directed, chewing-like movements induced by cholinomimetics, dopamine antagonists and dopamine depletions have many of the characteristics of parkinsonian tremor. These movements occur within the 3-7 Hz peak frequency range that is characteristic of parkinsonian tremor. Tremulous jaw movements are induced by many of the conditions that are associated with parkinsonism, and suppressed by several different antiparkinsonian drugs, including scopolamine, benztropine, L-DOPA, apomorphine, bromocriptine, amantadine and clozapine. Striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the generation of tremulous jaw movements, and substantia nigra pars reticulata appears to be a major basal ganglia output region through which the jaw movements are regulated. Future research on the neurochemical and anatomical characteristics of tremulous jaw movements could yield important insights into the brain mechanisms that generate tremulous movements.","Ageing is associated with impairments in a variety of biological functions, one of the most striking might be considered to be the impairment in cognitive function. This impairment probably relates to the vulnerability of the hippocampus to the ageing process, since several cognitive functions rely on the integrity of this brain area. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the effect of ageing on hippocampal function has focused to a great extent on analysis of age-related changes in long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus of experimental animals. LTP is a remarkable form of synaptic plasticity which is characterized by a persistent increase in synaptic efficacy following tetanic stimulation of an afferent pathway to one of the hippocampal subfields. On the basis of its properties, LTP has been proposed as a biological substrate for learning and/or memory. There is general agreement that aged rats exhibit an impaired ability to sustain LTP but there is no agreement on the underlying cause of this deficit. In this review, the evidence which suggests that age-related changes in membrane composition, triggered by oxidative changes, might significantly contribute to the impairment in LTP, is considered. These findings are supported by recent data which indicates that dietary supplementation with the antioxidant vitamins, E and C, reversed the age-related impairment in LTP, in parallel with reversing the age-related decrease in alpha-tocopherol concentration and the age-related increase in lipid peroxidation. The possibility that the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta, triggers several age-related changes in hippocampus is considered and, based on the evidence presented, the hypothesis that interleukin-1 beta plays a significant role in ageing in the hippocampus is proposed.","The increased expression and/or abnormal processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is associated with the formation of amyloid plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, which are one of the major morphological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the processes regulating APP metabolism, the proteolytic cleavage of APP into amyloidogenic or nonamyloidogenic fragments is of special interest. The cleavage of the APP by the alpha-secretase within the beta-amyloid sequence generates nonamyloidogenic C-terminal APP fragments and soluble APPs alpha, which has neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities. Proteolytic processing of APP by beta-secretase, on the other hand, exposes the N-terminus of beta-amyloid, which is liberated after gamma-secretase cleavage at the variable amyloid C-terminus. The resulting 39-43 amino acid beta-amyloid may be neurotoxic and disrupt neuronal connectivity after its accumulation in senile plaques. In this review, we discuss evidence derived from in vitro experiments, suggesting that the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-coupled M1/M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors increases the nonamyloidogenic, secretory pathway of APP processing. It has also been shown in animal models that under conditions of reduced M1/M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation the secretory pathway of APP processing is inhibited and that constitutive upregulation of M1/M3-associated PKC increases APP secretion. Thus, the cortical cholinergic hypoactivity characteristic of AD may inhibit the nonamyloidogenic APP processing pathway and lead to increased beta-amyloid generation. It has been shown in vitro that nerve growth factor (NGF)-associated signaling also influences the expression and catabolism of APP. Recent experiments with NGF-responsive cells revealed a specific role for the high-affinity NGF receptor, TrkA, in the increases in secretory APP processing and a role for the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, in the transcriptional regulation of APP. Therefore, treatments with NGF could ameliorate cortical cholinergic dysfunction in AD. These findings may influence the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating cholinergic function and at increasing nonamyloidogenic APP processing without elevating APP expression.","The basal ganglia have been implicated in a number of important motor functions, in particular in the initiation of motor responses. According to the current model of basal ganglia functions, motor initiation is supposed to be associated with an inhibition of basal ganglia output structures (substantia nigra pars reticulata/entopeduncular nucleus) which, in turn, might be brought about by corresponding striatal activity changes conveyed via direct and indirect intrinsic pathways to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the entopeduncular nucleus. Rodent studies using neuropharmacological manipulations of basal ganglia transmitter systems by neurotoxins or drugs provide converging evidence that dopamine within the caudate-putamen, but also within extrastriatal basal ganglia nuclei, is involved in motor initiation by modulating the activity of direct and indirect intrinsic pathways. However, the striatal segregation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in control of the direct and indirect projection neurons seems not to be maintained throughout the basal ganglia. In dopamine intact animals, striatal glutamate plays a major role in response initiation probably through actions on striatopallidal neurons involving N-methyl-D-aspartate, but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Striatal adenosine might also contribute to movement initiation by acting on adenosine A2A receptors located on striatopallidal neurons. Analysis of two integral parts of the indirect pathway revealed that inactivation of the subthalamic nucleus was found to facilitate response initiation, while inactivation of the globus pallidus resulted in facilitation as well as inhibition of response initiation indicating a complex contribution of this latter nucleus. Glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) controlling the activity of the substantia nigra pars reticulata could be involved in control of response initiation in a way predicted by the simplified model of basal ganglia functions. In contrast, the role of the entopeduncular nucleus in response initiation and its control through GABA and glutamate is at variance with this hypothesis, suggesting functional differences of the output structures. Taken together, neurochemical systems of the basal ganglia significantly contribute to intact response initiation by mechanisms which are only partly consistent with predictions of the current functional scheme of the basal ganglia. This suggests that a more complex model is required to account for these disparate findings.","Abdominal muscles serve many roles; in addition to breathing, especially at higher levels of chemical drive or at increased end-expiratory lung volumes, they are responsible for, or contribute to, such protective reflexes as cough, sneeze, and vomiting, generate the high intra-abdominal pressures necessary for defecation and parturition, are active during postural adjustments, and play an essential role in vocalization in many species. Despite this widespread involvement, however, their control has, with rare exceptions, received little attention for two major reasons. First, in most anesthetized or decerebrate preparations, they are relatively inactive at rest, in part because the position of the preparation (supine or prone with abdomen supported), reduces lung volume and, therefore, their activity. Second, unlike phrenic motoneurons innervating the diaphragm, identification of motoneurons to a particular abdominal muscle is difficult. At the lumbar level, a given motoneuron may innervate any one of the four abdominal muscles; at the thoracic level, they are also intermixed with those innervating the intercostals. The two internal muscles, the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis, respond more to increases in chemical or volume-related drive than the two external muscles, the rectus abdominis and external oblique; the basis for this differential sensitivity is unknown. Segmental reflexes at the thoracic and lumbar levels are sufficient to activate abdominal motoneurons in the absence of descending drive but the basis for these reflex effects is also unknown. Neuroanatomical experiments demonstrate many more inputs to, and outputs from, the nucleus retroambigualis, the brainstem region in which the premotor neurons are located, than can be accounted for by their respiratory role alone. These other connections likely subserve activities other than respiration. Studies of the multifunctional roles of the abdominal muscles, on the basis of recent work, hold considerable promise for improving our understanding of their control.","In this review first we evaluate evidence on the role of the neurobiological alterations induced by chronic ethanol consumption in the development of ethanol tolerance, dependence and withdrawal. Secondly, we describe the neuropathological consequences of chronic ethanol on cognitive functions and on brain structures. Chronic alcohol consumption can induce alterations in the function and morphology of most if not all brain systems and structures. While tolerance mechanisms are unlikely to contribute to the neuroadaptive changes associated with ethanol dependence, it is otherwise clear that repeated high, intoxicating doses of ethanol trigger those neuroadaptive processes that lead to dependence and contribute to the manifestation of the abstinence syndrome upon withdrawal. An unbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission is the most prominent neuroadaptive process induced by chronic ethanol consumption. Due to the diffuse glutamatergic innervation to all brain structures, the neuroadaptive alterations in excitatory neurotransmission can affect the function of most if not all of neurotransmitter systems. The expression of the withdrawal syndrome is the major causal factor for the onset and development of the neuropathological alterations. This suggests a link between the neuroadaptive mechanisms underlying the development of ethanol dependence and those underlying the functional and structural alterations induced by chronic ethanol. In animals and humans, specific alterations occur in the function and morphology of the diencephalon, medial temporal lobe structures, basal forebrain, frontal cortex and cerebellum, while other subcortical structures, such as the caudate nucleus, seem to be relatively spared. The neuropathological alterations in the function of mesencephalic and cortical structures are correlated with impairments in cognitive processes. In the brain of alcoholics, the prefrontal cortex and its subterritories seem particularly vulnerable to chronic ethanol, whether Korsakoff's syndrome is present or not. Due to the role of these cortical structures in cognitive functions and in the control of motivated behavior, functional alterations in this brain area may play an important role in the onset and development of alcoholism.","Melatonin was recently reported to be an effective free radical scavenger and antioxidant. Melatonin is believed to scavenge the highly toxic hydroxyl radical, the peroxynitrite anion, and possibly the peroxyl radical. Also, secondarily, it reportedly scavenges the superoxide anion radical and it quenches singlet oxygen. Additionally, it stimulates mRNA levels for superoxide dismutase and the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (all of which are antioxidative enzymes), thereby increasing its antioxidative capacity. Also, melatonin, at least at some sites, inhibits nitric oxide synthase, a pro-oxidative enzyme. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments melatonin has been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to nuclear DNA. While these effects have been observed primarily using pharmacological doses of melatonin, in a small number of experiments melatonin has been found to be physiologically relevant as an antioxidant as well. The efficacy of melatonin in inhibiting oxidative damage has been tested in a variety of neurological disease models where free radicals have been implicated as being in part causative of the condition. Thus, melatonin has been shown prophylactically to reduce amyloid beta protein toxicity of Alzheimer's disease, to reduce oxidative damage in several models of Parkinson's disease (dopamine auto-oxidation, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and 6-hydroxydopamine), to protect against glutamate excitotoxicity, to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, to lower neural damage due to gamma-aminolevulinic acid (phorphyria), hyperbaric hyperoxia and a variety of neural toxins. Since endogenous melatonin levels fal 1 markedly in advanced age, the implication of these findings is that the loss of this antioxidant may contribute to the incidence or severity of some age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.","Only limited therapeutic measures are currently available for the treatment of spinal cord injury. This review describes the pathologic mechanisms of trauma-induced spinal cord injury in rats, which will contribute to new understanding of the pathologic process leading to spinal cord injury and to further development of new therapeutic strategies. Spinal cord injury induced by trauma is a consequence of an initial physical insult and a subsequent progressive injury process that involves various pathochemical events leading to tissue destruction; the latter process should therefore be a target of pharmacological treatment. Recently, activated neutrophils have been shown to be implicated in the latter process of the spinal cord injury in rats. Activated neutrophils damage the endothelial cells by releasing inflammatory mediators such as neutrophil elastase and oxygen free radicals. Adhesion of activated neutrophils to the endothelial cell could also play a role in endothelial cell injury. This endothelial cell injury could in turn induce microcirculatory disturbances leading to spinal cord ischemia. We have found that some therapeutic agents that inhibit neutrophil activation alleviate the motor disturbances observed in the rat model of spinal cord injury. Methylprednisolone (MPS) and GM1 ganglioside, which are the only two pharmacological agents currently clinically available for treatment of acute spinal cord injury, do not inhibit neutrophil activation in this rat model. Taken together, these observations raise a possibility that other pharmacological agents that inhibit neutrophil activation used in conjunction with MPS or GM1 ganglioside may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury in humans.","Proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6, have multiple effects in the central nervous system (CNS) not strictly cytotoxic being involved in controlling neuronal and glial activation, proliferation, differentiation and survival, thus influencing neuronal and glial plasticity, degeneration as well as development and regeneration of the nervous system. Moreover, they can contribute to CNS disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Alzheimer's disease and human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia complex. Recent results with deficient mice in the expression of those cytokines indicate that they are in general more sensible to insults resulting in neural damage. Some of the actions induced by TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma, including both beneficial and detrimental, are mediated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-derived nitric oxide (NO) production. NO produced by iNOS may be beneficial by promoting the differentiation and survival of neurons. IL-6 does not induce iNOS, explaining why this cytokine is less often involved in this dual role protection pathology. Some of the proinflammatory as well as the neurotrophic effects of those cytokines also involve upregulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAM). Those apparently conflicting results may be reconciled considering that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in promoting the disease, mostly by inducing expression of CAM leading to alteration of the blood-brain barrier integrity, whereas they have a protective role once disease is established due to its immunosuppressive or neurotrophic role. Understanding the dichotomy pathogenesis/neuroprotection of those cytokines may provide a rationale for better therapeutic strategies.","A technique for thermal imaging of the animal and human brain cortex using an infrared optical system is described. Thermoencephaloscopy (TES) is based on improved thermovision and image processing techniques and allows two-dimensional, contact-free, dynamic and non-invasive recording of background and evoked cortical activity through an unopened skull. Activated (heated) and deactivated (cooled) zones of the cerebral cortex are revealed. The instrumental temporal resolution of TES is 40 msec (25 maps sec-1), the spatial resolution is up to 70 x 70 microns pixel-1. The diameter of the smallest recordable active region of the cortex is 200-300 microns. TES allows to detect the position, size and sequence of activation of precisely located specific cortical zones, and to measure their dynamics before, during and after sensory and direct cortical stimulation, motor acts and conditioning (associative learning). TES effects were recorded in rats, rabbits, cats, monkeys and humans. Waves were found spreading over the cortex with a speed up to 33 mm sec-1 along trajectories specific for the sensory modality and the site of stimulation. Some pathological processes in the brain are detectable by TES: spreading depression; stress; catalepsy; experimental tumors; and epileptic focuses. The main mechanisms of thermal responses recorded by TES are discussed: neural activity; local metabolism of units; local cerebral blood flow; and thermoconductivity in the activated zones of the cortex. Thermoencephaloscopy is a dynamic, non-invasive, contact-free, comparatively cheap, simple and inexpensive method of neuroimaging with a relatively high temporal and spatial resolution and sensitivity. It can be a useful tool in basic neuroscience and medicine.","In the past 15 years the release of neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the locus coeruleus (LC) has been studied by using three approaches: microdialysis; push-pull superfusion; and voltammetry. These sophisticated techniques, which render it possible to follow the time course and magnitude of neurochemical changes in anaesthetized and conscious animals, have permitted great strides towards understanding neurotransmission in the LC. It appears that noradrenaline, known to be released in distant terminal fields, is also released in the somatodendritic area of LC neurons in response to drugs and physiological stimuli. Furthermore, determination of in vivo release enables the identification of functionally important neurotransmitter systems involved in relaying and integrating information reaching the LC via afferent neurons. As outlined in this review, the release rates of glutamate, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and catecholamines, are modified in particular by arousing and stressful stimuli, pain, changes in cardiovascular homeostasis, as well as during opioid withdrawal or the sleep-wake-cycle. Profound interactions also occur between some of the neurotransmitters released during these situations. It appears that individual stimuli produce distinct neurochemical changes which contribute to the regulation of neuronal LC activity. Stimuli that activate LC neurons, such as pain, fall of blood pressure, noise, opiate withdrawal, do not produce a uniform response but modality-specific release patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters within the LC. From these studies and from existing neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data our knowledge of how neurotransmitters work in concert to regulate the functional state of LC noradrenergic perikarya in physiological and pathophysiological conditions is just emerging.","Preparations of Aconitum roots are employed in Chinese and Japanese medicine for analgesic, antirheumatic and neurological indications. The recent surge in use of phytomedicine derived from traditional Chinese medicine as well as increasing concerns about possible toxic effects of these compounds have inspired a great deal of research into the mechanisms by which certain Aconitum alkaloids may act on the central nervous system. The pharmacological effects of preparations of Aconitum roots are attributed to several diterpenoid alkaloids. The main alkaloid of these plants is aconitine, a highly toxic diterpenoid alkaloid which is known to suppress the inactivation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels by binding to neurotoxin binding site 2 of the alpha-subunit of the channel protein. In this article the pharmacology of several structurally related Aconitum alkaloids is highlighted and their therapeutic vs toxic potential is discussed. Neurochemical and neurophysiological studies will be reviewed with emphasis on the effects of the alkaloids in regions of the brain that have been implicated in pain transmission and generation of epileptic activity. Considering the chemical structure of the Aconitum alkaloids as well as their mechanism of action, a subdivision in three groups becomes obvious: the first group comprises such alkaloids which possess high toxicity due to two ester boundings at the diterpene skeleton. The members of this group activate voltage-dependent sodium channels already at resting potential and inhibit noradrenaline reuptake. Activation of sodium channels and in consequence excessive depolarization with final inexcitability and suppression of pain transmission account for their antinociceptive properties. The second group comprises less toxic monoesters which have been shown to possess strong antinociceptive, antiarrhythmic and antiepileptiform properties due to a blockade of the voltage-dependent sodium channel. Electrophysiological studies have revealed a use-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity by these alkaloids. They seem to be competitive antagonists of the group I-alkaloids. The third group of Aconitum alkaloids are lacking an ester side chain in the molecule. Toxicity is markedly reduced when compared with the two other groups. They fail to affect neuronal activity, but are reported to have antiarrhythmic actions suggesting that they may have different affinities to various subtypes of the alpha-subunit of the Na+ channel in brain and heart.","The experimental findings reviewed here indicate that the cerebellum has to be added to the regions known to be involved in the spatial learning. Cerebellar function is specifically linked to 'how to find an object' rather than 'where the object is in the space'. In the Morris water maze (MWM) hemicerebellectomized (HCbed) rats displayed a severe impairment in coping with spatial information, displaying only peripheral circling. And yet, when the MWM cue phase was prolonged, HCbed rats succeeded in acquiring some abilities to learn platform position, even in a pure place paradigm, such as finding a hidden platform with the starting points sequentially changed. Conversely, whether the searching strategy was acquired preoperatively, no exploration deficit appeared. Thus, cerebellar lesions appear to affect the procedural components of spatial function, sparing the declarative ones. When intact animals were non-spatially pre-trained and then HCbed, they exhibited an expanded scanning strategy, underlining the cerebellar involvement in procedural component acquisition. By testing HCbed rats in an active avoidance task, first without and then with a request for right/left discrimination, lesioned rats displayed severe deficits. Thus, besides a marked impairment in facing procedural components of spatial processing, cerebellar lesion provokes deficits also in right/left discrimination task. In conclusion, it is possible to propose the cerebellum as one part of a large system that includes frontal, posterior parietal, inferior temporal cortices, hippocampus and basal ganglia. These structures form an allocentric spatial system and an egocentric control system, that interlock to process the information involved in representing an object in the space.","Some authors claim that microglia originate from the neuroepithelium, although most now believe that microglial cells are of mesodermal origin, and probably belong to the monocyte/macrophage cell line. These cells must enter the developing central nervous system (CNS) from the blood stream, the ventricular space or the meninges. Afterward microglial cells are distributed more or less homogeneously through the entire nervous parenchyma. Stereotyped patterns of migration have been recognized during development, in which long-distance tangential migration precedes radial migration of individual cells. Microglial cells moving through the nervous parenchyma are ameboid microglia, which apparently differentiate into ramified microglia after reaching their definitive location. This is supported by the presence of cells showing intermediate features between those of ameboid and ramified microglia. The factors that control the invasion of the nervous parenchyma, migration within the developing CNS and differentiation of microglial cells are not well known. These phenomena apparently depend on environmental factors such as soluble or cell-surface bound molecules and components of the extracellular matrix. Microglial cells within the developing CNS are involved in clearing cell debris and withdrawing misdirected or transitory axons, and presumably support cell survival and neurite growth.","Focal cerebral ischemia elicits a strong inflammatory response involving early recruitment of granulocytes and delayed infiltration of ischemic areas and the boundary zones by T cells and macrophages. Infiltration of hematogenous leukocytes is facilitated by an upregulation of the cellular adhesion molecules P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells. Blocking of the leukocyte/endothelial cell adhesion process significantly reduces stroke volume after transient, but not permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the infarct region microglia are activated within hours and within days transform into phagocytes. Astrocytes upregulate intermediate filaments, synthesize neurotrophins and form glial scars. Local microglia and infiltrating macrophages demarcate infarcts and rapidly remove debris. Remote from the lesion no cellular infiltration occurs, but astroglia and microglia are transiently activated. Astrocytic activation is induced by spreading depression. In focal ischemia neurons die acutely by necrosis and in a delayed fashion by programmed cell death, apoptosis. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta are upregulated within hours in ischemic brain lesions. Either directly or via induction of neurotoxic mediators such as nitric oxide, cytokines may contribute to infarct progression in the post-ischemic period. On the other hand, inflammation is tightly linked with rapid removal of debris and repair processes. At present it is unclear whether detrimental effects of inflammation outweigh neuroprotective mechanisms or vice versa. In global ischemia inflammatory responses are limited, but micro- and astroglia are also strongly activated. Glial responses significantly differ between brain regions with selective neuronal death and neighbouring areas that are more resistent to ischemic damage.","A damage or pathological process that destroys the continuity of axons in the mature central nervous system (CNS) has devastating consequences and produces lasting functional deficits. One of the major challenges in this field is to stimulate the regrowth of severed axons and reconstruction of pathways. Recent progress in molecular and cell biology has resulted in an explosion of knowledge on factors in the adult CNS being nonsupportive or even actively inhibitory to axonal regrowth. The new findings have a strong impact on the development of new therapeutic concepts directed to stimulate axonal regeneration. They give rise to cautious optimism, showing that under some circumstances repair of a CNS lesion is possible. In this review the authors summarize the current knowledge on the factors and mechanisms involved in regeneration failure and provide an overview of the current therapeutic approaches that may enable effective CNS regeneration in the future.","Normal respiration, termed eupnea, is characterized by periodic filling and emptying of the lungs. Eupnea can occur 'automatically' without conscious effort. Such automatic ventilation is controlled by the brainstem respiratory centers of pons and medulla. Following removal of the pons, eupnea is replaced by gasping, marked by brief but maximal inspiratory efforts. The mechanisms by which the respiratory rhythms are generated have been examined intensively. Evidence is discussed that ventilatory activity can be generated in multiple regions of pons and medulla. Eupnea and gasping represent fundamentally different ventilatory patterns. Only for gasping has a critical region for neurogenesis been identified, in the rostral medulla. Gasping may be generated by the discharge of 'pacemaker' neurons. In eupnea, this pacemaker activity is suppressed and incorporated into the pontile and medullary neuronal circuit responsible for the neurogenesis of eupnea. Evidence for ventilatory neurogenesis which has been obtained from a number of in vitro preparations is discussed. A much-used preparation is that of a 'superfused' brainstem of the neonatal rat. However, activities of this preparation differ greatly from those of eupnea, as recorded in vitro or in arterially perfused in vitro preparations. Activities of this 'superfused' preparation are identical with gasping and, hence, results must be reinterpreted accordingly. The possibility is present that mechanisms responsible for generating respiratory rhythms may differ from those responsible for shaping respiratory-modulated discharge patterns of cranial and spinal nerves. The importance of pontile mechanisms in the neurogenesis and control of eupnea is reemphasized.","This review focuses on that most engaging feature of the sympathetic nervous system, its rhythmicity. In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although afferent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to fire in each synchronized discharge. Little is known about this control other than it appears to be quite separate from the control over the timing of discharges. Spinal cord mechanisms are possibly involved. SNA frequencies above 0.7 Hz do not appear to directly induce oscillations in innervated vasculature, however, are likely to contribute to setting the level of vasconstrictive tone. Slower frequencies appear to directly cause oscillations in blood flow.","Most functional studies of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels have been confined to photoreceptors and olfactory epithelium, in which CNG channels are abundant and easy to study. The widespread distribution of CNG channels in tissues throughout the body has only recently been recognized and the functions of this channel family in many of these tissues remain largely unknown. The molecular biological and pharmacological properties of the CNG channel family are summarized in order to put in context studies aimed at probing CNG channel functions in these tissues using pharmacological and genetic methods. Compounds have now been identified that are useful in distinguishing CNG channel activated pathways from cAMP/cGMP dependent-protein kinases or other pathways. The ways in which these interact with CNG channels are understood and this knowledge is leading to the identification of more potent and more specific CNG channel subtype-specific agonists or antagonists. Recent molecular and genetic analyses have identified novel roles of CNG channels in neuronal development and plasticity in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Targeting CNG channels via specific drugs and genetic manipulation (such as knockout mice) will permit better understanding of the role of CNG channels in both basic and higher orders of brain function.","Inflammatory components play an important part in many diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent evidence suggests that this may also be true of diseases which were previously considered as purely neuro-degenerative. However, it is also clear that inflammatory responses in the CNS differ in many ways from responses in non-CNS tissues. Some of these differences have been demonstrated by the use of animal models. For example, when bacteria are injected into the brain parenchyma, they induce a typical acute inflammatory response. However, unlike in other tissues, bacteria which are not cleared from the brain parenchyma remain undetected by the immune system. Some bacteria, such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin, can persist in the brain parenchyma for months sequestered in microglia and perivascular macrophages. When an animal with an intraparenchymal bacteria deposit is later sensitised peripherally, an immune response is evoked at the site of the deposits. The lesions induced in the CNS parenchyma are T-cell mediated and show characteristics typical of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The lesions produce a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and demyelination. These immune responses are similar to those described for multiple sclerosis lesions. The responses to bacteria are unique to the brain parenchyma. Pathogens injected into the ventricles induce inflammatory responses similar to those in other non-CNS tissues: there is an acute inflammatory response which develops spontaneously into an immune mediated response within the first week.","The vasodilating capability of cerebral vessels is vital to brain survival. There are multiple mechanisms participating in the regulation of cerebral vascular smooth muscle relaxation. The cyclic nucleotide-related signal transduction pathways are particularly important to the vasodilating function of cerebral arteries and arterioles. Those pathways are involved in the vasodilations elicited by a wide variety of stimuli, which include hypoxia and hypercapnia and agonist/receptor interactions (e.g. muscarinic, beta-adrenergic, and prostacyclin receptors). There is considerable control exerted upon the activities of the cyclic nucleotide signal transduction cascades. One of those control mechanisms relates to the abilities of cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monosphosphate (cAMP) and cyclic 3'-5' guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to modulate each other's synthesis, degradation, and actions. That capacity for ""crosstalk"" between the two pathways provides the focus of the present review. To facilitate our discussion of cGMP/cAMP crosstalk regulation, we have placed some emphasis on hypercapnia-induced cerebral vasodilation. The review considers crosstalk at 4 different levels. First, the capacity for each cyclic nucleotide to repress the degradation of its counterpart via actions on phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is discussed. Second, consideration is given to crosstalk regulation of cGMP/cAMP synthesis. Third cGMP- or cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG and PKA, respectively) are discussed with respect to: (a) the potential of each cyclic nucleotide to activate the counterpart kinase, and (b) the ability of PKG: PKA to elicit common actions. Fourth, some attention is given to the role of compartmentalization of: (a) the enzymes catalyzing cyclic nucleotide synthesis and degradation, (b) the enzymes responsible for cyclic nucleotides-mediated phosphorylations, and (c) the protein targets of those kinases.","Brain plasticity and the mechanisms controlling plasticity are central to learning and memory as well as the recovery of function after brain injury. While it is clear that neurotrophic factors are one of the molecular classes that continue to regulate brain plasticity in the adult central nervous system (CNS), less appreciated but equally profound is the role of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in plasticity mechanisms such as long term potentiation, preservation of neurons and regeneration. Ironically, however, CAMs can also reorganize the extra-cellular space and cause disturbances that drive the development of brain pathology in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Candidate molecules include the amyloid precursor protein which shares many properties of a classical CAM and beta-amyloid which can masquerade as a pseudo CAM. Beta-Amyloid serves as a nidus for the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease and like CAMs provides an environment for organizing neurotrophic factors and other CAMs. Inflammatory responses evolve in this environment and can initiate a vicious cycle of perpetuated neuronal damage that is medicated by microglia, complement and other factors. Certain CAMs may converge on common signal transduction pathways involving focal adhesion kinases. Thus a breakdown in the organization of key CAMs and activation of their signal transduction mechanisms may serve as a new principle for the generation of brain pathology.","This paper is the result of discussions between scientists working in widely separated areas, united by an interest in the hippocampus. The discussions focused on the possible role of GABA in the development and maturation of the hippocampus and in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). GABA neurons are among the first to differentiate in the hippocampus and the properties of GABA neurotransmission in the developing hippocampus are distinct from those in the adult. GABAergic transmission may play a role in the clustering and maturation of GABA receptors, as well as of receptors for other neurotransmitters. The development and maturation of synaptic connections involves changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton, and mechanical force generation is probably required to establish appropriate points of contact. This generation of force may require coupling of specific receptors to the cytoskeleton through specialized proteins. In AD, much of the developmental process is progressively unraveled in the hippocampus, as afferent fibers, most notably from entorhinal excitatory neurons and from basal forebrain cholinergic cells, degenerate. This denervation undoubtedly has consequences for receptor systems, dendritic morphology and the underlying cytoskeleton. GABA neurons remain in the AD hippocampus, and may actually contribute to abnormal firing and degeneration of remaining pyramidal neurons. This attempt to bring together data from different areas of research has allowed the development of a scheme which identifies significant specific gaps in our knowledge, which could be readily filled by focused experimental work.","Recovery after nervous system lesions may lead to partial re-institution of developmental schemes and processes. Here we review several of these proposed schemes, with the conclusion that though some processes may involve re-expression of embryonic phenotypes, there are many processes invoked during recovery from lesions that do not mirror developmental phenomena. The inability to fully revert to embryonic schemes because of adult phenotype may partially account for the decreased recovery observed in adults compared to that noted after lesions during development.","The synaptic plasticity that is addressed in this review follows neurodegeneration in the brain and thus has both structural as well as functional components. The model of neurodegeneration that has been selected is the kainic acid lesioned hippocampus. Degeneration of the CA3 pyramidal cells results in a loss of the Schaffer collateral afferents innervating the CA1 pyramidal cells. This is followed by a period of structural plasticity where new synapses are formed. These are associated with changes in the numbers and shapes of spines as well as changes in the morphometry of the dendrites. It is suggested that this synaptogenesis is responsible for an increase in the ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors mediating excitatory synaptic transmission at these synapses. Changes in the temporal and spatial properties of these synapses resulted in an altered balance between LTP and LTD. These properties together with a reduction in the inhibitory drive increased the excitability of the surviving CA1 pyramidal cells which in turn triggered epileptiform bursting activity. In this review we discuss the insights that may be gained from studies of the underlying molecular machinery. Developments in one of the collections of the cogs in this machinery has been summarized through recent studies characterizing the roles of neural recognition molecules in synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous systems of vertebrates and invertebrates. Such investigations of neural cell adhesion molecules, cadherins and amyloid precursor protein have shown the involvement of these molecules on the morphogenetic level of synaptic changes, on the one hand, and signal transduction effects, on the other. Further complex cogs are found in the forms of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) family of genes and their ligands play pivotal roles in the brain development and in regulating the growth and remodelling of neurones. Evidence is discussed for their role in the maintenance of cognitive function as well as Alzheimer's. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the clustering and maintenance of transmitter receptors at postsynaptic sites are the final cogs in the machinery that we have reviewed. Postsynaptic densities (PSD) from excitatory synapses have yielded many cytoskeletal proteins including actin, spectrin, tubulin, microtubule-associated proteins and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Isolated PSDs have also been shown to be enriched in AMPA, kainate and NMDA receptors. However, recently, a new family of proteins, the MAGUKs (for membrane-associated guanylate kinase) has emerged. The role of these proteins in clustering different NMDA receptor subunits is discussed. The MAGUK proteins are also thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors are highly clustered at excitatory postsynaptic sites in cortical and hippocampal neurones but have revealed differences in their choice of molecular components. Both GABAA and glycine (Gly) receptors mediate synaptic inhibition in the brain and spinal cord. Whilst little is known about how GABAA receptors are localized in the postsynaptic membrane, considerable progress has been made towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of Gly receptors. It has been shown that the peripheral membrane protein gephyrin plays a pivotal role in the formation of Gly receptor clusters most likely by anchoring the receptor to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Evidence for the distribution as well as function of gephyrin and Gly receptors is discussed. Postsynaptic membrane specializations are complex molecular machinery subserving a multitude of functions in the proper communication between neurones. Despite the fact that only a few key players have been identified it will be a fascinating to watch the story as to how they contribute to structural and functional plasticity unfold.","It seems likely that the Alzheimer disease (AD)-related dendritic changes addressed in this article are induced by two principally different processes. One process is linked to the plastic response associated with deafferentation, that is, long-lasting transneuronally induced regressive changes in dendritic geometry and structure. The other process is associated with severe alterations of the dendritic- and perikaryal cytoskeleton as seen in neurons with the neurofibrillary pathology of AD, that is, the formation of paired helical filaments formed by hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. As the development of dendritic and cytoskeletal abnormalities are at least mediated by alterations in signal transduction, this article also reviews changes in signal pathways in AD. We also discuss transgenic approaches developed to model and understand cytoskeletal abnormalities.","In the area of routing and sorting of dendritic traffic, the current phenomenological data beg questions about the cellular mechanisms utilized not only to transport material but also to modulate activity in a process, even apoptosis. To aid in formulating testable hypotheses, many plausible models are developed here and linked with some of the preliminary data that supports them. We first assume that in long dendrites the sorting of membranous proteins into transport vesicles also involves the linkage of motor proteins to the vesicles. Second, we assume that the cytoskeleton in dendrites is altered from the cytoskeleton in axons and the cell body. Viral glycoproteins, MAP2 and specific mRNA sorting into dendrites provide the simplest models for analyzing vesicular, cytoskeletal and RNA sorting. In the case of viral glycoproteins, initial sorting appears to occur at the Golgi but additional routing steps involve further complexities that could best be served by an additional sorting step at the junction of the cell body and the process. Transport of the specialized cytoskeletal proteins and specific mRNAs as well as vesicular material could be controlled by a similar gatekeeper at the mouth of a process. Studies of the microtubule-organelle motor complex, regulation of microtubule-based motility by microtubule-associated proteins, and slow axonal transport all provide insights into important aspects of the routing and sorting. These processes are in turn controlled by extracellular signals such as those generated by matrix molecules or their hydrolysis products in the case of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Routing and sorting mechanisms may be central to the development of Alzheimer's disease in view of evidence that APP processing is affected, transport is disturbed, and intracellular vesicles (early endosomes) hypertrophied. Further it is possible that routing mechanisms play a role in cell-cell interactions as, for example, the possibility that pathogenic/cellular stress signals may be passed along circuits transsynaptically.","Neurons are extraordinarily complicated devices, in which physical and chemical processes are intercoupled, in spatially non-uniform manner, over distances of millimeters or more, and over time scales of < 1 msec up to the lifetime of the animal. The fact that neuronal populations generating most brain activities of interest are very large-perhaps many millions of cells-makes the task of analysis seem hopeless. Yet, during at least some population activities, neuronal networks oscillate synchronously. The emergence of such oscillations generates precise temporal relationship between neuronal inputs and outputs, thus rendering tractable the analysis of network function at a cellular level. We illustrate this idea with a review of recent data and a network model of synchronized gamma frequency (> 20 Hz) oscillations in vitro, and discuss how these and other oscillations may relate to recent data on back-propagating, action potentials, dendritic Ca2+ transients, long-term potentiation and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic potentials.","The goal of this review in an overview of the structural elements of the entorhinal-hippocampal connection. The development of the dendrites of hippocampal neurons will be outlined in relation to afferent pathway specificity and the mature dendritic structure compared. Interneurons will be contrasted to pyramidal cells in terms of processing of physiological signals and convergence and divergence in control of hippocampal circuits. Mechanisms of axonal guidance and target recognition, target structures, the involvement of receptor distribution on hippocampal dendrites and the involvement of non-neuronal cellular elements in the establishment of specific connections will be presented. Mechanisms relevant for the maintenance of shape and morphological specializations of hippocampal dendrites will be reviewed. One of the significant contexts in which to view these structural elements is the degree of plasticity in which they participate, during development and origination of dendrites, mature synaptic plasticity and after lesions, when the cells must continue to maintain and reconstitute function, to remain part of the circuitry in the hippocampus. This review will be presented in four main sections: (1) interneurons-development, role in synchronizing influence and hippocampal network functioning; (2) principal cells in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus regions-their development, function in terms of synaptic integration, differentiating structure and alterations with lesions; (3) glia and glia/neuronal interactions-response to lesions and developmental guidance mechanisms; and (4) network and circuit aspects of hippocampal morphology and functioning. Finally, the interwoven role of these various elements participating in hippocampal network function will be discussed.","There is extensive evidence that ethanol interacts with a variety of neurotransmitters. Considerable research indicates that the major actions of ethanol involve enhancement of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at GABAA receptors and blockade of the NMDA subtype of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor. Ethanol increases GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition, but this does not occur in all brain regions, all cell types in the same region, nor at all GABAA receptor sites on the same neuron, nor across species in the same brain region. The molecular basis for the selectivity of the action of ethanol on GaBAA receptors has been proposed to involve a combination of benzodiazepine subtype, beta 2 subunit, and a splice variant of the gamma 2 subunit, but substantial controversy on this issue currently remains. Chronic ethanol administration results in tolerance, dependence, and an ethanol withdrawal (ETX) syndrome, which are mediated, in part, by desensitization and/or down-regulation of GABAA receptors. This decrease in ethanol action may involve changes in subunit expression in selected brain areas, but these data are complex and somewhat contradictory at present. The sensitivity of NMDA receptors to ethanol block is proposed to involve the NMDAR2B subunit in certain brain regions, but this subunit does not appear to be the sole determinant of this interaction. Tolerance to ethanol results in enhanced EAA neurotransmission and NMDA receptor upregulation, which appears to involve selective increases in NMDAR2B subunit levels and other molecular changes in specific brain loci. During ETX a variety of symptoms are seen, including susceptibility to seizures. In rodents these seizures are readily triggered by sound (audiogenic seizures). The neuronal network required for these seizures is contained primarily in certain brain stem structures. Specific nuclei appear to play a hierarchical role in generating each stereotypical behavioral phases of the convulsion. Thus, the inferior colliculus acts to initiate these seizures, and a decrease in effectiveness of GABA-mediated inhibition in these neurons is a major initiation mechanism. The deep layers of superior colliculus are implicated in generation of the wild running behavior. The pontine reticular formation, substantia nigra and periaqueductal gray are implicated in generation of the tonic-clonic seizure behavior. The mechanisms involved in the recruitment of neurons within each network nucleus into the seizure circuit have been proposed to require activation of a critical mass of neurons. Achievement of critical mass may involve excess EAA-mediated synaptic neurotransmission due, in part, to upregulation as well as other phenomena, including volume (non-synaptic diffusion) neurotransmission. Effects of ETX on receptors observed in vitro may undergo amplification in vivo to allow the excess EAA action to be magnified sufficiently to produce synchronization of neuronal firing, allowing participation of the nucleus in seizure generation. GABA-mediated inhibition, which normally acts to limit excitation, is diminished in effectiveness during ETX, and further intensifies this excitation.","This review evaluates the various lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the small intestine during feeding plays a physiological satiety. Issues considered include, the effects of systemic injection of CCK on consummatory and operant feeding, the role of the vagus nerve, the effects of CCKB receptor antagonists, and the neuroendocrine responses to exogenous CCK. A critical appraisal of this research indicates that while it is clearly demonstratable that exogenous peripheral CCK can alter food intake by acting on CCKA receptors, the mechanism involved may be more closely related to the induction if aversion and nausea, rather than satiety. With regard to peripheral endogenous CCK, the available evidence also does not seem to support a role for the hormone in satiety. In particular, it is doubtful whether plasma concentrations of CCK following a meal are sufficiently high to inhibit feeding. Moreover, CCKA receptor antagonist which do not cross the blood brain barrier fail to increase meal size, as would be expected if peripheral CCK was an effective satiety factor. In addition, the recent literature concerned with the possibility that CCK may have a direct action within the brain in the control of food intake has been reviewed. These studies show that CCK administered intracerebroventicularly, or by micoinjection into discrete brain regions, also inhibits feeding via a CCKA receptor mechanism. However, the physiological relevance of these findings have yet to be determined.","Protein kinase C (PKC), activated by either diacylglycerol and/or arachidonic acid, through the activation of presynaptic receptors or nerve or nerve depolarization is involved is involved in the enhancement of transmitter release from many neural types. This facilities is most likely mediated by the phosphorylation of proteins involved in vesicle dynamics although a role for ion channels cannot be ruled out. PKC is not fundamental to the release process but rather has a modulatory role of PKC is to help maintain transmitter output during prolonged or elevated levels of activation and this seems to parallel suggestions that PKC is involved in the movement of reserve pools of vesicles into release-study sites. presynaptic facilitatory actions mediated by PKC are also involved in integrated modulatory functions such as long term potentiation, again where it elevates or maintains transmitter output. Although studies have tried to identify specific roles for various PKC isoforms, the actions of phorbol esters in elevators transmitter release do not fit with known potencies on individual isoforms and lit suggests that PKC may be located at an intraneuronal location which is difficult to access for lipophilic phorbol esters and further work is required in this area.","Neuronal cells are unique within the organism. In addition to forming long-distance connections with other nerve cells and non-neuronal targets, they lose the ability to regenerate their neurites and to divide during maturation. Consequently, external violations like trauma or disease frequently lead to their disappearance and replacement by non-neuronal, and thus not properly functioning cells. The advent of microtechnology and construction of artificial implants prompted to create particular devices for specialised regions of the nervous system, in order to compensate for the loss of function. The scope of the present work is to review the current devices in connection with their applicability and functional perspectives. (1) Successful implants like the cochlea implant and peripherally implantable stimulators are discussed. (2) Less developed and not yet applicable devices like retinal or cortical implants are introduced, with particular emphasis given to the reasons for their failure to replace very complex functions like vision. (3) Material research is presented both from the technological aspect and from their biocompatibility as prerequisite of any implantation. (4) Finally, basic studies are presented, which deal with methods of shaping the implants, procedures of testing biocompatibility and modification of improving the interfaces between a technical device and the biological environment. The review ends by pointing to future perspectives in neuroimplantation and restoration of interrupted neuronal pathways.","Viral vectors are becoming increasingly important tools to investigate the function of neural proteins and to explore the feasibility of gene therapy to treat diseases of the nervous system. This gene transfer technology is based on the use of a virus as a gene delivery vehicle. In contrast to functional analysis of gene products in transgenic mouse, viral vectors can be applied to transfer genes to somatic, post-mitotic cells of fully developed animals. To date, five viral vector systems are available for gene transfer in the nervous system. These include recombinant and defective herpes viral vectors, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors and lentiviral vectors. Of these vectors herpes and adenoviral vectors are the most common in use. To date, one of the main hurdles in applying these two vector systems is the focal immune response that occurs following intraparenchymal infusion. Despite this limitation, herpes and adenoviral vectors have been used successfully to modify the physiological response to injury in several rodent models of neurodegeneration. The first purpose of this review is to describe the principles of the generation of viral vectors and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the viral vector systems currently in use for gene transfer in the nervous system. Secondly, we give an overview of the performance of these vectors following direct infusion in the nervous system and review the results obtained with these vectors in animal models of neurodegeneration and regeneration. The results of these initial studies have provided a framework for future experiments based on gene transfer strategies with viral vectors to study normal physiology and pathology of the nervous system.","The results of recent studies investigating the connections and chemoarchitecture of the basal forebrain of amphibians provide strong evidence that tetrapod vertebrates share a common pattern of basal ganglia organization. This pattern includes the existence of dorsal and ventral striatopallidal systems, reciprocal connections between the striatopallidal complex and the diencephalic and mesencephalic basal plate (striato-nigral and nigro-striatal projections), and descending pathways from the striatopallidal system to the midbrain tectum and reticular formation. The connectional similarities are parallelled by similarities in the distribution of chemical markers of striatal and pallidal structures such as dopamine, substance P and enkephalin. Moreover, studies of development and expression of homeobox genes have given further support to the notion that both amniotic and anamniotic tetrapods have a common pattern of basal ganglia organization. A new nomenclature of basal forebrain structures in amphibians is proposed which reflects our current understanding of basal ganglia organization in this class of vertebrates.","Attention and arousal are multi-dimensional psychological processes, which interact closely with one another. The neural substrates of attention, as well as the interaction between arousal and attention, are discussed in this review. After a brief discussion of psychological and neuropsychological theories of attention, event-related potential correlates of attention are discussed. Essentially, attention acts to modulate stimulus-induced electrical potentials (N100/P100, P300, N400), rather than generating any unique potentials of its own. Functional neuroimaging studies of attentional orienting, selective attention, divided attention and sustained attention (and its inter-dependence on underlying levels of arousal) are then reviewed. A distinction is drawn between the brain areas which are crucially involved in the top-down modulation of attention (the 'sources' of attention) and those sensory-association areas whose activity is modulated by attention (the 'sites' of attentional expression). Frontal and parietal (usually right-lateralised) cortices and thalamus are most often associated with the source of attentional modulation. Also, the use of functional neuroimaging to test explicit hypotheses about psychological theories of attention is emphasised. These experimental paradigms form the basis for a 'new generation' of functional imaging studies which exploit the dynamic aspect of imaging and demonstrate how it can be used as more than just a 'brain mapping' device. Finally, a review of psychopharmacological studies in healthy human volunteers outlines the contributions of the noradrenergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems to the neurochemical modulation of human attention and arousal. While, noradrenergic and cholinergic systems are involved in 'low-level' aspects of attention (e.g. attentional orienting), the dopaminergic system is associated with more 'executive' aspects of attention such as attentional set-shifting or working memory.","Adenovirus is an efficient vector for neuronal gene therapy due to its ability to infect post-mitotic cells, its high efficacy of cell transduction and its low pathogenicity. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding for therapeutical agents can be delivered in vivo after direct intracerebral injection into specific brain areas. They can be transported in a retrograde manner from the injection site to the projection cell bodies offering promising applications for the specific targeting of selected neuronal populations not easily accessible by direct injection, such as the motor neurons in the spinal cord. Adenoviral vectors are also efficient tools for the ex vivo gene therapy, that is, the genetical modification of cells prior to their transplantation into the nervous system. Recently, the efficacy of the adenovirus as a gene vector system has been demonstrated in several models of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor neuron diseases. In rat models of PD, adenoviruses encoding for either tyrosine hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase or glial-derived neurotrophic factor improved the survival and the functional efficacy of dopaminergic cells. Similarly, the intramuscular injection of an adenovirus encoding for neurotrophin-3 had substantial therapeutic effects in a mutant mouse model of motor neuron degenerative disease. However, although adenoviruses are highly attractive for neuronal gene transfer, they can trigger a strong inflammatory reaction leading in particular to the destruction of infected cells. The recent development of new generations of adenoviral vectors could shed light on the nature of the immune reaction caused by adenoviral vectors in the brain. The use of these new vectors, combined with that of neurospecific and regulatable promoters, should improve adenovirus gene transfer into the central nervous system.","The amygdaloid nuclear complex is critical for producing appropriate emotional and behavioral responses to biologically relevant sensory stimuli. It constitutes an essential link between sensory and limbic areas of the cerebral cortex and subcortical brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, brainstem, and striatum, that are responsible for eliciting emotional and motivational responses. This review summarizes the anatomy and physiology of the cortical pathways to the amygdala in the rat, cat and monkey. Although the basic anatomy of these systems in the cat and monkey was largely delineated in studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, detailed information regarding the cortico-amygdalar pathways in the rat was only obtained in the past several years. The purpose of this review is to describe the results of recent studies in the rat and to compare the organization of cortico-amygdalar projections in this species with that seen in the cat and monkey. In all three species visual, auditory, and somatosensory information is transmitted to the amygdala by a series of modality-specific cortico-cortical pathways (""cascades"") that originate in the primary sensory cortices and flow toward higher order association areas. The cortical areas in the more distal portions of these cascades have stronger and more extensive projections to the amygdala than the more proximal areas. In all three species olfactory and gustatory/visceral information has access to the amygdala at an earlier stage of cortical processing than visual, auditory and somatosensory information. There are also important polysensory cortical inputs to the mammalian amygdala from the prefrontal and hippocampal regions. Whereas the overall organization of cortical pathways is basically similar in all mammalian species, there is anatomical evidence which suggests that there are important differences in the extent of convergence of cortical projections in the primate versus the nonprimate amygdala.","Animals require two types of fundamental information for accurate navigation: location and directional heading. Current theories hypothesize that animals maintain a neural representation, or cognitive map, of external space in the brain. Whereas cells in the rat hippocampus and parahippocampal regions encode information about location, a second type of allocentric spatial cell encodes information about the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's on-going behaviors. These head direction (HD) cells are found in several areas of the classic Papez circuit. This review focuses on experimental studies conducted on HD cells and describes their discharge properties, functional significance, role in path integration, and responses to different environmental manipulations. The anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus appears critical for the generation of the directional signal. Both motor and vestibular cues also play important roles in the signal's processing. The neural network models proposed to account for HD cell firing are compared with known empirical findings. Examples from clinical cases of patients with topographical disorientation are also discussed. It is concluded that studying the neural mechanisms underlying the HD signal provides an excellent opportunity for understanding how the mammalian nervous system processes a high level cognitive signal.","The progressive frontalization of both eyes in mammals causes overlap of the left and right visual fields, having as a consequence a region of binocular field with single vision and stereopsis. The horizontal separation of the eyes makes the retinal images of the objects lying in this binocular field have slight horizontal and vertical differences, termed disparities. Horizontal disparities are the main cue for stereopsis. In the past decades numerous physiological studies made on monkeys, which have in many aspects a similar visual system to humans, showed that a population of visual cells are capable of encoding the amplitude and sign of horizontal disparity. Such disparity detectors were found in cortical visual areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, VP, MT (V5) and MST of monkeys and in the superior colliculus of the cat and opossum. According to their disparity tuning function, these cells were first grouped into tuned excitatory, tuned inhibitory, near and far sub-groups. Subsequent studies added two more categories, tuned near and tuned far cells. Asymmetries between left and right receptive field position, on and off regions, and intra-receptive field wiring are believed to be the neural mechanisms of disparity detection. Because horizontal disparity alone is insufficient to compute reliable stereopsis, additional information about fixation distance and angle of gaze is required. Thus, while there is unequivocal evidence of cells capable of detecting horizontal disparities, it is not known how horizontal disparity is calibrated. Sensitivity to vertical disparity and information about the vergence angle or eye position may be the source of this additional information.","Recognition memory relies on two processes: (i) identification and (ii) judgement concerning prior occurrence. A system centred on perirhinal cortex appears to be responsible for judgement of prior occurrence based on discrimination of the familiarity of stimuli or their recency of occurrence; in contrast, a hippocampal system probably supplies information concerning the episodic, contextual aspects of recognition memory. This review chiefly concerns the perirhinal system and, in particular, neurones that signal the prior occurrence of stimuli by a decrease in response. Details concerning such decremental responses are given and it is argued that such responses in perirhinal cortex are adequate for and central to discrimination of stimulus familiarity and recency in a wide range of situations. Information is given of similar types of neuronal responses in anatomically related brain regions and what may be deduced about the operation of the recognition memory system. The possibility is discussed that the neuronal responses that signal information concerning the recent occurrence of stimuli may contribute to repetition priming as well as recognition memory. Other described changes in the activity of individual neurones such as response enhancements, or sustained (delay) activity may allow solution of specialised forms of recognition memory tasks where relatively short-term working memory is adequate. Implications of the multi-faceted nature of recognition memory for the interpretation of results are emphasised. Unsolved problems and avenues for future experimentation, including determining the nature of possible underlying synaptic plastic changes, are discussed.","Following our strategy of using simple discrimination tasks to investigate the primate visual system, we trained both human and monkey subjects for two orientation discrimination tasks: an identification and a successive discrimination. Contrasting these two tasks allowed us to isolate the temporal comparison component and to relate this component to activity in right fusiform gyrus using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and to infero-temporal cortex using a lesion approach in monkeys. Single-cell recordings in infero-temporal cortex demonstrated that neurons in this region can contribute to the three processes underlying temporal comparison: (1) sensorial representation of visual stimuli, (2) maintaining a trace of the preceding stimulus, and (3) comparison of the incoming stimulus with that trace. By the same token, a comparison of these two tasks, which use the same input and the same attribute, demonstrates the task dependency of processing in the human and non-human primate visual system.","This paper provides an overview of the compensatory mechanisms which come into action during experimental and human parkinsonism. The intrinsic properties of the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) which degenerate during Parkinson's disease are described in detail. It is generally considered that the nigrostriatal pathway is principally responsible for the compensatory preservation of dopaminergic function. It is also becoming clear that the morphological characteristics of dopaminergic neurones and the dual character, synaptic and asynaptic, of striatal dopaminergic innervation engender two modes of transmission, wiring and volume, and that both these modes play a role in the preservation of dopaminergic function. The plasticity of the dopamine neurones, extrinsic or intrinsic to the striatum, can thus be regarded as another compensatory mechanism. Recent anatomical and electrophysiological studies have shown that the SNc receives both glutamatergic and cholinergic inputs. The dynamic role this innervation plays in compensatory mechanisms in the course of the disease is explained and discussed. Recent developments in the field of compensatory mechanisms speak for the urgence to develop a valid chronic model of Parkinson's disease, integrating all the clinical features, even resting tremor, and illustrating the gradual evolution of nigral degeneration observed in human Parkinson's disease. Only a dynamic approach to the physiopathological study of compensatory mechanisms in the basal ganglia will be capable of elucidating these complex questions.","Long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the cerebellum has been the first established example of enduring decrease of synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. This review focuses on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Thus, at the level of the postsynaptic membranes of PCs, induction of LTD requires concommitent activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and of ionotropic and metabotopic glutamate receptors, of the alpha-amino-3 hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxalone-4-propionate (AMPA) and mGluR1 alpha types respectively. Subsequent intracellular cascades involve production of nitric oxide from arginine and of cGMP, activation of phospholipase A2 and of several protein kinases including protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases. Activation of protein kinase G and of phosphatases are also likely to be involved in LTD induction. In contrast, there are still uncertainties concerning a major role of release of calcium from internal stores in LTD induction. Finally protein synthesis is required for a late phase of LTD to occur. All available experimental evidence points towards a postsynaptic site for LTD expression. In particular, electrophysiological data demonstrate a genuine modification of the functional properties of AMPA receptors of PCs during LTD, and immunocytochemical evidence suggests that this might result from a phosphorylation of these receptors.","It is proposed that altered dendrite length and de novo formation of new dendrite branches in cholinoceptive cells are responsible for long-term memory storage, a process enabled by the degradation of microtubule-associated protein-2. These memories are encoded as modality-specific associable representations. Accordingly, associable representations are confined to cytoarchitectonic modules of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The proposed sequence of events leading to long-term storage in cholinoceptive dendrites begins with changes in neuronal activity, then in neurotrophin release, followed by enhanced acetylcholine release, muscarinic response, calcium influx, degradation of microtubule-associated protein-2, and finally new dendrite structure. Hypothetically, each associable representation consists of altered dendrite segments from approximately 5000-15,000 cholinoceptive cells contained within one or a few module(s). Simultaneous restructuring during consolidation of long-term memory is hypothesized to result in a similar infrastructure among dendrite sets, facilitating co-activation of those dendrite sets by neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, and conceivably enabling high energy interactions between those dendrites by phenomena such as quantum optical coherence. Based on the specific architecture proposed, it is estimated that the human telecephalon contains enough dendrites to encode 50 million associable representations in a lifetime, or put another way, to encode one new associable representation each minute. The implications that this proposal has regarding treatments for Alzheimer's disease are also discussed.","Generalized non-convulsive absence seizures are characterized by the occurrence of synchronous and bilateral spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on the electroencephalogram, that are concomitant with a behavioral arrest. Many similarities between rodent and human absence seizures support the use of genetic rodent models, in which spontaneous SWDs occur. This review summarizes data obtained on the neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms of absence seizures with special emphasis on the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). EEG recordings from various brain regions and lesion experiments showed that the cortex, the reticular nucleus and the relay nuclei of the thalamus play a predominant role in the development of SWDs. Neither the cortex, nor the thalamus alone can sustain SWDs, indicating that both structures are intimely involved in the genesis of SWDs. Pharmacological data confirmed that both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmissions are involved in the genesis and control of absence seizures. Whether the generation of SWDs is the result of an excessive cortical excitability, due to an unbalance between inhibition and excitation, or excessive thalamic oscillations, due to abnormal intrinsic neuronal properties under the control of inhibitory GABAergic mechanisms, remains controversial. The thalamo-cortical activity is regulated by several monoaminergic and cholinergic projections. An alteration of the activity of these different ascending inputs may induce a temporary inadequation of the functional state between the cortex and the thalamus and thus promote SWDs. The experimental data are discussed in view of these possible pathophysiological mechanisms.","Axon injury rapidly activates microglial and astroglial cells close to the axotomized neurons. Following motor axon injury, astrocytes upregulate within hour(s) the gap junction protein connexin-43, and within one day glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Concomitantly, microglial cells proliferate and migrate towards the axotomized neuron perikarya. Analogous responses occur in central termination territories of peripherally injured sensory ganglion cells. The activated microglia express a number of inflammatory and immune mediators. When neuron degeneration occurs, microglia act as phagocytes. This is uncommon after peripheral nerve injury in the adult mammal, however, and the functional implications of the glial cell responses in this situation are unclear. When central axons are injured, the glial cell responses around the affected neuron perikarya appears to be minimal or absent, unless neuron degeneration occurs. Microglia proliferate, and astrocytes upregulate GFAP along central axons undergoing anterograde, Wallerian, degeneration. Although microglia develop into phagocytes, they eliminate the disintegrating myelin very slowly, presumably because they fail to release molecules which facilitate phagocytosis. During later stages of Wallerian degeneration, oligodendrocytes express clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in several conditions of cell degeneration. A hypothetical scheme for glial cell activation following axon injury is discussed, implying the injured neurons initially interact with adjacent astrocytes. Subsequently, neighbouring resting microglia are activated. These glial reactions are amplified by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, in which cytokines appear to be important mediators. The specific functional properties of the activated glial cells will determine their influence on neuronal survival, axon regeneration, and synaptic plasticity. The control of the induction and progression of these responses are therefore likely to be critical for the outcome of, for example, neurotrauma, brain ischemia and chronic neurodegenerative diseases.","It is widely accepted that excitatory amino acid transmitters such as glutamate are involved in the initiation of seizures and their propagation. Most attention has been directed to synapses using NMDA receptors, but more recent evidence indicates potential roles for ionotropic non-NMDA (AMPA/kainate) and metabotropic glutamate receptors as well. Based on the role of glutamate in the development and expression of seizures, antagonism of glutamate receptors has long been thought to provide a rational strategy in the search for new, effective anticonvulsant drugs. Furthermore, because glutamate receptor antagonists, particularly those acting on NMDA receptors, protect effectively in the induction of kindling, it was suggested that they may have utility in epilepsy prophylaxis, for example, after head trauma. However, first clinical trials with competitive and uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists in patients with partial (focal) seizures, showed that these drugs lack convincing anticonvulsant activity but induce severe neurotoxic adverse effects in doses which were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Interestingly, the only animal model which predicted the unfavorable clinical activity of competitive NMDA antagonists in patients with chronic epilepsy was the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy, indicating that this model should be used in the search for more effective and less toxic glutamate receptor antagonists. In this review, results from a large series of experiments on different categories of glutamate receptor antagonists in fully kindled rats are summarized and discussed. NMDA antagonists, irrespective whether they are competitive, high- or low-affinity uncompetitive, glycine site or polyamine site antagonists, do not counteract focal seizure activity and only weakly, if at all, attenuate propagation to secondarily generalized seizures in this model, indicating that once kindling is established, NMDA receptors are not critical for the expression of fully kindled seizures. In contrast, ionotropic non-NMDA receptor antagonists exert potent anticonvulsant effects on both initiation and propagation of kindled seizures. This effect can be markedly potentiated by combination with low doses of NMDA antagonists, suggesting that an optimal treatment of focal and secondarily generalized seizures may require combined use of both non-NMDA and NMDA antagonists. Given the promising results obtained with novel AMPA/kainate antagonists and glycine/NMDA partial agonists in the kindling model, the hope for soon having potentially useful glutamate antagonists for use in epileptic patients is increasing.","Behavioral sensitization refers to the progressive augmentation of behavioral responses to psychomotor stimulants that develops during their repeated administration and persists even after long periods of withdrawal. It provides an animal model for the intensification of drug craving believed to underlie addiction in humans. Mechanistic similarities between sensitization and other forms of neuronal plasticity were first suggested on the basis of the ability of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists to prevent the development of sensitization [Karler, R., Calder, L. D., Chaudhry, I. A. and Turkanis, S. A. (1989) Blockade of ""reverse tolerance"" to cocaine and amphetamine by MK-801. Life Sci., 45, 599-606]. This article will review the large number of subsequent studies addressing: (1) the roles of NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the development and expression of behavioral sensitization, (2) excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and the role of conditioning in sensitization, (3) controversies regarding EAA involvement in behavioral sensitization based on studies with MK-801, (4) the effects of acute and repeated stimulant administration on EAA neurochemistry and EAA receptor expression, and (5) the neuroanatomy of EAA involvement in sensitization. To summarize, NMDA, AMPA metabotropic glutamate receptors all participate in the development of sensitization, while maintenance of the sensitized state involves alterations in neurochemical measures of EAA transmission as well as in the expression and sensitivity of AMPA and NMDA receptors. While behavioral sensitization likely involves complex neuronal circuits, with EAAs participating at several points within this circuitry, EAA projections originating in prefrontal cortex may play a particularly important role in the development of sensitization, perhaps via their regulatory effects on midbrain dopamine neurons. The review concludes by critically evaluating various hypotheses to account for EAA involvement in the development of behavioral sensitization, and considering the question of whether EAA receptors are involved in mediating the rewarding effects of psychomotor stimulants and sensitization of such rewarding effects.","Dystonia is a common movement disorder which is thought to represent a disease of the basal ganglia. However, the pathogenesis of the idiopathic dystonias, i.e. the neuroanatomic and neurochemical basis, is still a mystery. Research in dystonia is complicated by the existence of various phenotypic and genotypic subtypes of idiopathic dystonia, probably related to heterogeneous dysfunctions. In neurological diseases in which no obvious neuronal degeneration can be found, such as in idiopathic dystonia, the identification of a primary defect is difficult, because of the large number of chemically distinct, but functionally interrelated, neurotransmitter systems in the brain. The variable response to pharmacological agents in patients with idiopathic dystonia supports the notion that the underlying biochemical dysfunctions vary in the subtypes of idiopathic dystonia. Hence, in basic research it is important to clearly define the involved type of dystonia. Animal models of dystonias were described as limited. However, over the last years, there has been considerable progress in the evaluation of animal models for different types of dystonia. Apart from animal models of symptomatic dystonia, genetic animal models with inherited dystonia which occurs in the absence of pathomorphological alterations in brain and spinal cord are describe. This review will focus mainly on genetic animal models of different idiopathic dystonias and pathophysiological findings. In particular, in the case of the mutant dystonic (dt) rat, a model of generalized dystonia, and in the case of the genetically dystonic hamster (dt(sz)), a model of paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis has been used, as these show great promise in contributing to the identification of underlying mechanisms in idiopathic dystonias, although even a proper animal model will probably never be equivalent to a human disease. Several pathophysiological findings from animal models are in line with clinical observations in dystonic patients, indicating abnormalities not only in the basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei, but also in the cerebellum and brainstem. Through clinical studies and neurochemical data several similarities were found in the genetic animal models, although the current data indicates different defects in dystonic animals which is consistent with the notion that dystonia is a heterogenous disorder. Different supraspinal dysfunctions appear to lead to manifestation of dystonic movements and postures. In addition to increasing our understanding of the pathophysiology of idiopathic dystonia, animal models may help to improve therapeutic strategies for this movement disorder.","The use of animal models in studying disorders of dopaminergic transmission in humans, such as Parkinson's disease, depends on the assumption that morphological and electrophysiological properties of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra are relatively constant from rodents to monkeys and humans. While the electrophysiological properties of nigral dopaminergic neurons are highly characteristic and appear to be remarkably uniform, morphological studies of nigral compacta neurons have shown significant size differences across mammalian species. This discrepancy between morphological and electrophysiological characteristics could be reconciled if scaling of neuronal size between species was such that intrinsic properties and responses to afferent inputs would not be affected. We review the principles of morphological scaling of compacta neurons and address this problem by construction and analysis of specific passive and active membrane models. These demonstrate that the size differences between compacta neurons from rats to primates lead to distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties and that even conservative scaling is not sufficient to ensure constant activity patterns unless further compensatory mechanisms are present. Comparisons with experimental data show that the electrophysiological properties of compacta neurons are characteristic compared to other neuronal types but less uniform than generally recognized. The available data are not sufficient to prove a specific relationship between morphological and electrophysiological properties of compacta neurons but it is evident that they provide no support to the assumption that dopaminergic neurons have similar properties across mammalian species. Thus, comparative experimental studies are required to establish the validity of animal models for nigral function and pathology in humans.","Glutamate receptors (GluRs) mediate most of the excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In addition, they are involved in plastic changes in synaptic transmission as well as excitotoxic neuronal cell death that occurs in a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders. The GluRs are divided into two distinct groups, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. The ionotropic receptors (iGluRs) are further subdivided into three groups: alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. The metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) are coupled to GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), and regulate the production of intracellular messengers. The application of molecular cloning technology has greatly advanced our understanding of the GluR system. To date, at least 14 cDNAs of subunit proteins constituting iGluRs and 8 cDNAs of proteins constituting mGluRs have been cloned in the mammalian CNS, and the molecular structure, distribution and developmental change in the CNS, functional and pharmacological properties of each receptor subunit have been elucidated. Furthermore, the obtained clones have provided valuable tools for conducting studies to clarify the physiological and pathophysiological significances of each subunit. For example, the generation of gene knockout mice has disclosed critical roles of some GluR subunits in brain functions. In this article, we review recent progress in the research for GluRs with special emphasis on the molecular diversity of the GluR system and its implications for physiology and pathology of the CNS.","The formation of the primate fovea has fascinated a substantial number of histologists, pathologists, ophthalmologists and physiologists for more than a century. In this article, using data from the literature as well as our own observations, we identify events which we believe are crucial in this process and present a developmental neurobiologist's view of the formation of the primate fovea. The fovea is a region of the retina specialized for diurnal, high acuity functions which require a high spatial density of cone photoreceptors as well as a large number of inner retinal cells in order to establish the distinct retinofugal pathways (ganglion cell axons) receiving from individual cones in the foveal cone mosaic. A unique feature of the fovea is the displacement of cells connected to the foveal cones onto the rim of the fovea. It is generally believed that this displacement counteracts the problems caused by the scattering of the incoming light by cells and blood vessels of the inner retina. We believe that one of the crucial events in the formation of the primate fovea is the early centripetal migration of photoreceptors towards the central area (centripetal displacement). This process, initiated early in development, continues throughout intrauterine life until some months or years postnatal. We propose that the displacement of cells from the inner layers is related to the earlier developmental accumulation of photoreceptors and inner retinal cells centrally. This, we propose, leads to metabolic ""starvation"" of the inner retina, resulting from the complete absence of retinal vessels from the vicinity of the incipient fovea. It is suggested that these factors in turn trigger centrifugal displacement of inner retinal cells towards the encroaching perifoveal capillary network and lead to the formation of the foveal depression.","In animal models of global and focal ischemia neuroprotection is typically determined by quantifying the degree of cell loss or reduction in infarct volume shortly after the ischemic insult. These methods are unable to reliably detect more subtle forms of neuronal death and dysfunction that arise from injury to non-homogeneous cell populations (e.g. hilar and striatal neurons), or to dendrites (e.g. loss of structural proteins or decreased synaptic transmission). It is argued that this type of covert injury contributes to a wide range of functional impairments (e.g. decreased working memory, altered field potentials, loss of forelimb dexterity) that are rarely used as outcome measures in experimental studies even though they are of paramount importance clinically. The limitations of a purely histological approach in assessing neuroprotection are clearly illustrated using examples of protective drug therapies, mild hypothermia and ischemic preconditioning. An alternative strategy that incorporates behavioural, electrophysiological and histological endpoints is put forth as a more powerful method for gauging neuroprotection. The strength of this approach will be increased if these assessments are performed on the same animals. By incorporating functional measures and longer postischemic survival into their experimental protocols, investigators will increase the validity of their models and hopefully reduce the likelihood of advancing ineffective therapies into costly clinical trials.","In this review, the developmental expression of alpha-, beta- and gamma-subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) in the rat spinal cord was summarized, and possible roles of this protein for neuronal differentiation were discussed. Faint immunoreactivity (IR) for PKCs was first demonstrated in the cervical spinal cord on embryonic day 13 (E-13). It gradually became stronger, and between E-18 and postnatal day 0 (P-0), strong IR for these three subspecies was uniformly distributed throughout the spinal cord. While thereafter, it irregularly declined, and reached the adult pattern around P-28 or P-35. The motor neurons began to express these three subspecies of PKC in the nucleus, perikaryal cytoplasm, dendrites and axons, soon after they began to differentiate. In the perikaryal cytoplasm, the IR was expressed mainly on ribosomes, and in the dendrites, mainly on cytoskeletal elements. At the late embryonic and early postnatal stages, IR for these PKCs was expressed both in the presynaptic terminals and on the postsynaptic densities. While thereafter, the IR in the former declined, and was detected only on the postsynaptic densities. The dorsal corticospinal tract transiently expressed strong IR for these PKCs at the early postnatal developmental stages, but thereafter, the IR rapidly declined. The developing corticospinal tract fibers expressed strong IR mainly on cytoskeletal elements. In contrast, in the mature fibers, IR for alpha-PKC was detected on some cytoskeletal elements, and for beta-PKC on almost all cytoskeletal elements, but IR for gamma-PKC, mainly on smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. These findings suggest that PKC might be involved in several aspects of neuronal differentiation such as gene expression, protein synthesis, morphological maturation and synapse formation.","The binding of glucocorticoids to CNS receptors results in the modulation of many processes, ranging from neurotransmission to cell birth and death. It is of no surprise, therefore, that the removal of these steroids following adrenalectomy disrupts a variety of physiological functions throughout the brain. It is the aim of this review to briefly describe the findings of research examining some of these glucocorticoid-mediated CNS effects; however, as many of these areas have been reviewed extensively by others, this review will focus on the recently described phenomenon, adrenalectomy-induced hippocampal cell death.","Explanted preparations of peripheral nerves with attached dorsal root ganglia of adult mammals and amphibia survive for several days in serum-free medium and can be used to study axonal regeneration in vitro. This review outlines the methods which we routinely use and how they may be applied to study different aspects of axonal regeneration. When the peripheral nerves are crushed in vitro, axons regenerate through the crush site into the distal stump within 1 day (mouse) or 3 days (frog). The outgrowth distance of the leading sensory axons can be determined with the use of a simple method based on axonal transport of labelled proteins. A compartmentalised system permits selective application of drugs and other agents to either ganglia or peripheral nerve containing the regenerating axons and has been used to study selected aspects of regeneration including influence of non-neuronal cells, retrograde signalling, axonal release of proteins during regeneration and the role of phospholipase A2 activity. Explanted preparations may also be cultured in a layer of extracellular matrix material (matrigel), in which spontaneous outgrowth of a large number of naked axons from the cut ends of nerves starts within 1 day and continues for several days. This provides an opportunity to study the direct effects of different agents on axonal elongation. Preparations cultured in collagen gels show sparse spontaneous axonal growth, but this can be increased by addition of certain growth factors. The phenotype of the regenerating axons can be studied using immunohistochemical methods.","Synaptic connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) of the rat has been investigated with the electron microscope after labeling both the pre- and postsynaptic elements. Prefrontal corticothalamic fibers end exclusively as small axon terminals with round synaptic vesicles (SR boutons), which make asymmetrical synaptic contacts with distal dendritic segments of MD neurons. Thalamocortical terminals from MD in PFC are also of the SR type and form asymmetrical synaptic contacts predominantly with dendritic spines arising from the apical or basal dendrites of pyramidal cells whose somata reside in layers III, V and VI. At least some pyramidal cells in layer III that receive MD afferents are callosal cells, whereas deep layer pyramidal cells projecting to MD receive directly some of the thalamocortical terminations from MD, suggesting that the recurrent loop to MD is monosynaptically mediated. Thus, taken together with recent evidence that both the PFC-MD and MD-PFC pathways are glutamatergic and excitatory, the cortical excitation exerted by afferent fibers from MD is transferred, not only back to MD itself through deep pyramidal cells, but also the contralateral prefrontal cortex via pyramidal cells in layer III of the ipsilateral prefrontal cortex. Concerning modulatory and inhibitory inputs, fibers to MD from the ventral pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata have been shown to be inhibitory and GABAergic. In addition, fibers from the ventral tegmental area preferentially make symmetrical membrane thickenings (i.e. inhibitory synapses) on deep pyramidal cells in PFC that receive synaptic endings from MD. From these morphological grounds, therefore, cells in the ventral pallidum, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the ventral tegmental area may mediate, to some extent, an inhibitory effect on the reverberatory excitation between PFC and MD.","Forty years of research into the function of L-glutamic acid as a neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) have uncovered a tremendous complexity in the actions of this excitatory neurotransmitter and an equally great complexity in the molecular structures of the receptors activated by L-glutamate. L-Glutamate is the most widespread excitatory transmitter system in the vertebrate CNS and in addition to its actions as a synaptic transmitter it produces long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability, synaptic structure and function, neuronal migration during development, and neuronal viability. These effects are produced through the activation of two general classes of receptors, those that form ion channels or ""ionotropic"" and those that are linked to G-proteins or ""metabotropic"". The pharmacological and physiological characterization of these various forms over the past two decades has led to the definition of three forms of ionotropic receptors, the kainate (KA), AMPA, and NMDA receptors, and three groups of metabotropic receptors. Twenty-seven genes are now identified for specific subunits of these receptors and another five proteins are likely to function as receptor subunits or receptor associated proteins. The regulation of expression of these protein subunits, their localization in neuronal and glial membranes, and their role in determining the physiological properties of glutamate receptors is a fertile field of current investigations into the cell and molecular biology of these receptors. Both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors are linked to multiple intracellular messengers, such as Ca2+, cyclic AMP, reactive oxygen species, and initiate multiple signaling cascades that determine neuronal growth, differentiation and survival. These cascades of complex molecular events are presented in this review.","Sensitization is manifested as an increased response of neurones to a variety of inputs following intense or noxious stimuli. It is one of the simplest forms of learning and synaptic plasticity and it represents an important feature of nociception. In the spinal cord, repeated stimulation (at constant strength) of dorsal root afferents including nociceptive C fibres can elicit a progressive increase in the number of action potentials generated by motoneurones and interneurones. This phenomenon is termed ""action potential windup"" and is used as a cellular model of pain sensitization developing at the level of the central nervous system. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for windup generation might allow clarification of the cellular mechanisms of pain signalling and development of new strategies for pain treatment. Action potential windup is observed in a minority of cells only, indicating that certain cell-specific mechanisms are responsible for its generation. The most reliable index to predict windup generation is the rate at which the membrane potential is depolarized during repetitive stimulation. This phenomenon has been proposed to be due to gradual recruitment of NMDA receptor activity, to summation of slow excitatory potentials mediated by substance P (and related peptides) or to facilitation of slow calcium channels by metabotropic glutamate receptors. Little is known about the role of synaptic inhibition in windup, although it should not be underestimated. Each theory per se is unable to account for all the experimental observations. Since NMDA receptors are involved in many forms of synaptic plasticity, additional mechanisms such as summation of slow peptidergic potentials, facilitation of slow Ca2+ currents and disinhibition are proposed as necessary to impart specificity to pain-induced sensitization. These additional mechanisms might be species specific and change during development or chronic pain states.","In the first part of three overviews on recognition memory in the rat, we discussed the tasks employed to study recognition memory. In the second part, we discussed the neuroanatomical systems thought to be of importance for the mediation of recognition memory in the rat. In particular, we delineated two parallel-distributed neuronal networks, one that is essential for the processing of non-spatial/item recognition memory processes and incorporates the cortical association areas such as TE1, TE2 and TE3, the rhinal cortices, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and prefrontal cortical areas (Network 1), the other comprising of the hippocampus, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei and medial prefrontal areas (Network 2), suggested to be pivotal for the processing of spatial recognition memory. The next step will progress to the level of the neurotransmitters thought to be involved. Current data suggest that the majority of drugs have non-specific, i.e. delay-independent effects in tasks measuring recognition memory. This may be due to attentional, motivational or motoric changes. Alternatively, delay-independent effects may result from altered acquisition/encoding rather than from altered retention. Furthermore, the neurotransmitter systems affected by these drugs could be important as modulators rather than as mediators of recognition memory per se. It could, of course, also be the case that systemic treatment induces non-specific effects which overshadow any specific, delay-dependent, effect. This possibility receives support from lesion experiments (for example, of the septohippocampal cholinergic system) or studies employing local intracerebral infusion techniques. However, it is evident that those delay-dependent effects are relatively subtle and more readily seen in delayed response paradigms, which tax spatial recognition memory. One interpretation of these results could be that some neurotransmitter systems are more involved in spatial than in item recognition memory processes. However, performance in delayed response tasks can be aided by mediating strategies. Drugs or lesions can alter those strategies, which could equally explain some of the (delay-dependent) drug effects on delayed responding. Thus, it is evident that neither of the neurotransmitter systems reviewed (glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) can be viewed as being directly and exclusively concerned with storage/retention. Rather, our model of recognition memory suggests that information about previously encountered items is differentially processed by distinct neural networks and is not mediated by a single neurotransmitter type.","A discussion of the neuroanatomical systems thought to be of importance for the mediation of recognition memory in the rat warrants consideration of different, but not necessarily exclusive concepts. An important concept is the hypothesis that a dichotomy in the neural systems mediating spatial and non-spatial (item) memory exists in the rat. We have adopted a model of recognition memory suggesting that information about previously encountered items is stored in a dynamic pattern of neural activity and not in a localized representation. These patterns are features of distributed neuronal networks and different networks may process different forms of recognition memory. Two parallel-distributed neuronal networks are proposed in the rat. Network 1 is essential for the processing of non-spatial/item recognition memory processes and incorporates the cortical association areas such as TE1, TE2 and TE3, the rhinal cortices, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and prefrontal cortical areas. Network 2 comprises the hippocampus, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei and medial prefrontal areas, especially the prelimbic cortex, and is suggested to be pivotal for the processing of spatial recognition memory.","Recognition is the process by which a subject is aware that a stimulus has been previously experienced. It requires that the characteristics of events are perceived, discriminated, identified and then compared (matched) against a memory of the characteristics of previously experienced events. Understanding recognition memory, its underlying neuronal mechanisms, its dysfunction and alleviation of the latter by putative cognition enhancing drugs is a major research target and has triggered a wealth of animal studies. One of the most widely used animals for this purpose is the rat, and it is the rat's recognition memory which is the focus of this review. In this first part, concepts of recognition memory, stages of mnemonic processing and paradigms for the measurement of the rat's recognition memory will be discussed. In two subsequent articles (parts II and III) we will focus on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recognition memory in rats. Three major points arise from the comparison of paradigms that have in the past been used to assess recognition memory in rats. First, it should be realized that some tasks which, at face value, can all be considered to measure recognition memory in rats, may not assess recognition memory at all but may, for example, be based on recall rather than recognition. Second, it is evident that different types of recognition memory can be distinguished and that tasks differ in the type of recognition memory taxed. Some paradigms, for example, measure familiarity, whereas others assess recency. Furthermore, paradigms differ as to whether spatial stimuli or items are employed. Third, different processes, ranging from stimulus-response learning to the formation of concepts, may be involved to varying extent in different tasks. These are important considerations and question the predictive validity of the results obtained from studies examining, for example, the effects of putative cognition enhancing drugs.","The nature of neural plasticity and the factors that influence it vary throughout life. Adult neurons undergo extensive and continual adaptation in response to demands that are quite different from those of early development. We review the main influences on the survival, growth and neurotransmitter expression in adult and ageing sympathetic neurons, comparing these influences to those at work in early development. This ""developmental"" approach is proposed because, despite the contrasting needs of different phases of development, each phase has a profound influence on the mechanisms of plasticity available to its successors. Interactions between neurons and their targets, whether effector cells or other neurons, are vital to all of these aspects of neural plasticity. Sympathetic neurons require access to target-derived diffusible neurotrophic factors such as NGF, NT3 and GDNF, as well as to bound elements of the extracellular matrix such as laminin. These factors probably influence plasticity throughout life. In adult life, and even in old age, sympathetic neurons are relatively resistant to cell death. However, they continue to require target-derived diffusible and bound factors for their maintenance, growth and neurotransmitter expression. Failure to maintain appropriate neuronal function in old age, for example in the breakdown of homeostasis, may result partly from a disturbance of the dynamic, trophic relationship between neurons and their targets. However, there is no clear evidence that this is due to a failure of targets to synthesize neurotrophic factors. On the neural side of the equation, altered responsiveness of sympathetic neurons to neurotrophic factors suggests that expression of the trk and p75 neurotrophin receptors contributes to neuronal survival, maintenance and growth in adulthood and old age. Altered receptor expression may therefore underlie the selective vulnerability of some sympathetic neurons in old age. The role of neural connectivity and activity in the regulation of synthesis of target-derived factors, as well as in neurotransmitter dynamics, is reviewed.","Hair cells in mechanosensory systems transduce mechanical stimuli into biological signals to be presented to and analyzed by the brain. Vestibular hair cells transduce stimuli primarily associated with the organism's orientation and motion in space. When examined superficially it may appear that the hair cells act as passive transducers whereby mechanical stimulation of their hair bundle results in transmitter release at their afferent synapses. In fact, hair cell functions are more complicated, and the mechanical signals are heavily processed even before being encoded in afferent nerve activity. Hair cells are different from one another in morphology, biophysics, transmitter and transmitter receptor complements, not only across different organs (as one might expect), but even in the same organ. This review focuses on hair cell morpho-physiological properties, ionic conductances, neurotransmitters/modulators and their receptors, second messengers and effectors. Special features of hair cell neurotransmission, as the synaptic body and the presence of autoreceptors and local circuits, are also discussed, as is the possibility of a differential modulation of hair cell transmitter release in the resting and mechanically-stimulated states.","Over the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has been directed to establishing the roles of angiotensin II (ANG) within the central nervous system. When this work began in the late 1970s the concept that this circulating hormone may also act as a neurotransmitter within the brain was contrary to the established dogma regarding synaptic transmission. There is now substantial anatomical data describing the distribution of ANG receptors, and the biochemical machinery for the production of this peptide, within the CNS. In addition many studies have described physiological and cellular consequences of activation of these receptors by both exogenous administration and endogenous release of ANG. Data from single cell studies are now also beginning to elucidate both signal transduction pathways and ion channels, influenced as a consequence of peptide actions at these receptors. These observations effectively establish the status of ANG as a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) used for synaptic communication by specific populations of CNS neurons.","Cortical modulation of central cardiovascular control mechanisms has been recognized for many decades. However, it is only recently that the mechanisms underlying cortical influences on circulatory function have been systematically examined. This review considers the view that certain regions of the cerebral cortex, including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and insular cortex (IC), participate in specific aspects of central circulatory control. Anatomical investigations indicate that these cortical areas are connected with hypothalamic, midbrain, pontine and medullary brain regions involved in cardiovascular control. Lesions of the MPFC and IC have demonstrated modulation of the activity of cardiovascular reflexes such as the baroreceptor heart rate reflex and involvement in conditioned cardiovascular responses. Electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that cortical regions are able to influence premotor sympathoexcitatory vasomotor neurons within the rostral ventrolateral medulla and subsequently alter sympathetic vasomotor tone. Cortical regions such as the IC receive visceral sensory information arising from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors within the cardiovascular system. In contrast, the MPFC receives afferents predominantly from limbic sources, although its outputs include structures associated with central sympathetic vasomotor control. Cortical modulation of circulatory function has been demonstrated in man and may underlie the cardiovascular components of a number of conditions. It is suggested that cortical areas involved in visceral sensory or visceral motor processes associated with circulatory function may be involved in generation of patterns of cardiovascular responses specific for certain behaviours.","The synapses between sensory cells in the inner ear and the afferent dendrites of ganglion cells are well suited to investigations of fundamental mechanisms of fast synaptic signalling. The presynaptic elements can be isolated for electrophysiological and functional studies while the synapses can be easily recognized in the electron microscope due to their distinct morphological features. This allows for a broader range of correlative functional and structural analyses than can be applied to synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). As in most fast excitatory synapses in the CNS the transmitter in the afferent hair cell synapses appears to be glutamate or a closely related compound. Recent studies have revealed many of the key molecular players at this type of synapse and how they are spatially and functionally coupled. By use of high resolution immunogold cytochemistry it has been shown that AMPA glutamate receptors are specifically expressed in the postsynaptic specialization of afferent hair cell synapses (except at those established by outer hair cells in the organ of Corti) and that their density varies as a function of the distance from the release sites (demonstrated for the afferent contacts of inner hair cells). The glutamate transporter GLAST is localized in supporting cell membranes and concentrated in those membrane domains that face the synaptic regions. Glutamine synthetase and phosphate-activated glutaminase--which are responsible for the interconversion of glutamate and glutamine--are selectively localized in non-neuronal and neuronal elements, respectively. Taken together with quantitative immunogold data on the cellular compartmentation of glutamate and glutamine the above findings suggest that the sensory epithelia in the inner ear sustain a cycling of glutamate carbon skeletons. In this process, the supporting cells may carry out functions analogous to those of glial cells in the CNS. Functional and morphological analyses of the presynaptic membrane indicate that L-type Ca(2+)-channels and Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-channels are colocalized and clustered at the active zone. Influx through the L-type channels triggers synaptic release and their close spatial association with Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-channels appears to be critical for frequency tuning. The focal expression of different Ca(2+)-channels combined with a high intracellular buffering capacity permits several Ca(2+)-signalling pathways to operate in parallel without undue interference. The molecular organization of the afferent hair cell synapses reflects the functional demand for speed and precision and attests to the ability of the pre- and postsynaptic elements to target and anchor key proteins at specific membrane domains.","Microglial cells are believed to play an active role in brain inflammatory, immune and degenerative processes. Depending on the magnitude of microglial reaction, on the type of stimulus and on the concurrence of other local factors, microglia can contribute to host defence and repair, or to the establishment and maintenance of brain damage. Many of the effects of microglial cells can be ascribed to the numerous substances that these cells can synthesize and release in response to a variety of stimuli (cytokines, pro-inflammatory substances, neurotransmitters, toxins, etc.). The present article deals with two classes of compounds that activated microglial cells can produce in large amounts: prostanoids (that derive from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway), and nitric oxide (that is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase). Prostanoids and nitric oxide have a number of common targets, on which they may exert similar or opposite actions, and have a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation, immune responses and cell viability. Their synthesis can massively increase when the inducible isoforms of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase are expressed. The metabolic pathways of prostanoids and nitric oxide are finely tuned by the respective end-products, by cyclic AMP and by a number of exogenous factors, such as cytokines, glucocorticoids, lipocortin-1 and others. Some of these factors (e.g. transforming growth factor-beta 1, interleukin-10, lipocortin-1) may be secreted by microglial cells themselves, and act in an autocrine-paracrine way. In view of the neuroprotective role attributed to some prostaglandins and to the cytotoxicity of excessive levels of nitric oxide or its derivatives, the balance between prostanoid and nitric oxide levels may be crucial for orienting microglial reactions towards neuroprotection or neurotoxicity.","Diverse circadian rhythms are generated, maintained and/or coordinated by brain structures constituting the circadian timing system. However, the mechanisms underlying the variety in activity types and circadian rhythm phases and amplitudes are currently unknown. We address this problem by comparing rhythms in diurnal and nocturnal mammals, while focusing on alterations not involving the central circadian oscillator. The circadian rhythms are divided into two groups: activity-independent and activity-related. The rhythms in the first group have similar acrophases in all mammals and are anticipated to function as an internal zeitgeber (time giver). Analysis of activity-related circadian rhythms in behavior, blood pressure (BP) and renal excretion suggests separate mechanisms in their regulation in addition to the central suprachiasmatic nuclei-located circadian oscillator. We propose that: (a) a passive hypothalamic oscillator coordinates the phases and underlies the high amplitude of behavioral circadian rhythms; (b) a separate rostral hypothalamic network participates in the regulation of the low-amplitude circadian BP rhythm; and (c) a circadian oscillator in the kidney generates electrolyte excretion rhythms. A model is offered where the overt activity is determined by the phase-relationship between the circadian and the passive hypothalamic oscillator. Specific brain structures or peripheral circadian oscillators integrate circadian and other signals for different activity-related circadian rhythms. The hypothalamic structures implicated in regulation of behavioral and blood pressure rhythms belong to the circadian timing system since they underlie circadian rhythms diversity. The same hypothalamic areas selectively modulate circadian rhythms in response to homeostatic stimuli or stress without engaging the circadian oscillator.","Transforming growth factors-betas (TGF-betas), a family of multifunctional peptide growth factors, affect cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The three mammalian TGF-beta isoforms, TGF-betas 1, 2 and 3, are expressed in adult human brain. Since neuronal degeneration is a defining feature of CNS degenerative diseases, TGF-beta may be important because it can influence neuronal survival. In vitro TGF-beta promotes survival of rat spinal cord motoneurons and dopaminergic neurons. In addition to direct effects on neuronal survival, TGF-beta treatment of cultured astrocytes induces a reactive phenotype. Thus, TGF-beta may also normalize the extracellular matrix environment in degenerative diseases. The expression of TGF-betas change in response to neuronal injury. TGF-beta 1 expression increases in astrocytes and microglia in animal models of cerebral ischemia, while TGF-beta 2 expression increases in activated astroglial cells in human neurodegenerative diseases. TGF-betas protect neurons from a variety of insults. TGF-beta maintains survival of chick telencephalic neurons made hypoxic by treatment with cyanide and decreases the area of infarction when administered in animal models of cerebral ischemia. In vitro TGF-beta protects neurons from damage induced by treatment with beta-amyloid peptide, FeSO4 (induces production of reactive oxygen species), Ca2+ ionophores, glutamate, glutamate receptor agonists and MPTP (toxic for dopaminergic neurons). TGF-beta maintains mitochondrial potential and Ca2+ homeostasis and inhibits apoptosis in neurons. TGF-beta does not prevent neuronal degeneration in a rat model of Parkinson's disease and has yet to be tested in newly developed transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. TGF-beta is a potent neuroprotective agent which may affect the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS.","The contribution of the mammillary region to several classes of learning and memory has been reviewed. There is considerable evidence that lesions of this region of the brain impair performance on tasks that require memory for locations that an animal has visited, but that the deficit depends both on the amount of damage within the region and the difficulty of the task. Such lesions, however, do not appear to impair performance on a variety of spatial conditional associative learning tasks which require the animal to form an association between a place or a scene and a stimulus embedded within it. In addition, damage to the region of the mammillary bodies does not impair the ability to learn a variety of non-spatial memory tasks. These studies suggest that the mammillary region may play a selective role in certain types of spatial learning and memory.","Insulin is a molecule that has played a key role in several of the most important landmarks in medical and biological research. It is one of the most extensively studied protein hormones, and its structure and function have been elucidated in many vertebrate species, ranging from man to hagfish and turkey. The structure, function as well as tissue of synthesis of vertebrate insulins are strictly conserved. The structural identification of insulin-related peptides from invertebrates has disrupted the picture of an evolutionary stable peptide hormone. Insulin-related peptides in molluscs and insects turned out to be a structurally diverse group encoded by large multi-gene families that are uniquely expressed in the brain and serve functions different from vertebrate insulin. In this review, we discuss invertebrate insulins in detail. We examine how these peptides relate to the model role that vertebrate insulin has played over the years; however, more importantly, we discuss several unique principles that can be learned from them. We show how diversity of these peptides is generated at the genetic level and how the structural diversity of the peptides is linked to the exclusive presence of a single type of neuronal insulin receptor-related receptor. We also discuss the fact that the invertebrate peptides, in addition to a hormonal role, may also act in a synaptic and/or nonsynaptic fashion as transmitters/neuromodulators on neurons in the brain. It can be expected that the use of well-defined neuronal preparations in invertebrates may lead to a further understanding of these novel functions and may act as guide preparations for a possible role of insulin and its relatives in the vertebrate brain.","Dementia due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the commonest cause of dementia in children, young adults and middle-aged people. Its incidence continues to rise despite the use of newer antiretroviral agents. The study of the pathogenesis of HIV dementia has lead to the discovery of novel mechanisms of neural dysfunction and toxicity, and holds promise for further discovery of new molecules and pathways involved in maintaining cerebral function and enabling dysfunction. New to the field of neurovirology is the emerging concept that proteins that are part of the virus may themselves be neurotoxic by virtue of their abilities to be either directly toxic to brain cells or may, through their actions on glial cells or macrophages, release neurotoxic products coded by the host genome. These mechanisms have been demonstrated for HIV-1 and accordingly we propose a new term, virotoxins, to describe such actions. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the pathophysiological mechanisms by which these viral and cellular products affected by HIV virotoxins cause neural dysfunction.","After a long period of inconclusive observations, the intrinsic primary afferent neurons of the intestine have been identified. The intestine is thus equipped with two groups of afferent neurons, those with cell bodies in cranial and dorsal root ganglia, and these recently identified afferent neurons with cell bodies in the wall of the intestine. The first, tentative, identification of intrinsic primary afferent neurons was by their morphology, which is type II in the terminology of Dogiel. These are multipolar neurons, with some axons that project to other nerve cells in the intestine and other axons that project to the mucosa. Definitive identification came only recently when action potentials were recorded intracellularly from Dogiel type II neurons in response to chemicals applied to the lumenal surface of the intestine and in response to tension in the muscle. These action potentials persisted after all synaptic transmission was blocked, proving the Dogiel type II neurons to be primary afferent neurons. Less direct evidence indicates that intrinsic primary afferent neurons that respond to mechanical stimulation of the mucosal lining are also Dogiel type II neurons. Electrophysiologically, the Dogiel type II neurons are referred to as AH neurons. They exhibit broad action potentials that are followed by early and late afterhyperpolarizing potentials. The intrinsic primary afferent neurons connect with each other at synapses where they transmit via slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials, that last for tens of seconds. Thus the intrinsic primary afferent neurons form self-reinforcing networks. The slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials counteract the late afterhyperpolarizing potentials, thereby increasing the period during which the cells can fire action potentials at high rates. Intrinsic primary afferent neurons transmit to second order neurons (interneurons and motor neurons) via both slow and fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Excitation of the intrinsic primary afferent neurons by lumenal chemicals or mechanical stimulation of the mucosa appears to be indirect, via the release of active compounds from endocrine cells in the epithelium. Stretch-induced activation of the intrinsic primary afferent neurons is at least partly dependent on tension generation in smooth muscle, that is itself sensitive to stretch. The intrinsic primary afferent neurons of the intestine are the only vertebrate primary afferent neurons so far identified with cell bodies in a peripheral organ. They are multipolar and receive synapses on their cell bodies, unlike cranial and spinal primary afferent neurons. They communicate with each other via slow excitatory synaptic potentials in self reinforcing networks and with interneurons and motor neurons via both fast and slow EPSPs.","The Xenopus embryo has been well studied and the circuitry underlying motor pattern generation largely elucidated. We have extended this analysis by determining the roles of individual voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in controlling the motor pattern for swimming and two mechanisms that control rundown of this pattern. Xenopus embryo spinal neurons possess at least six classes of ion channel: a fast Na+ channel; a mixture of kinetically similar Ca2+ channels; a fast K+ channel; a slow K+ channel; a Na(+)-dependent K+ channel; and a slowly activating Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channel. The roles of the voltage-gated currents in determining neuronal firing properties and operation of the locomotor circuitry have been examined both pharmacologically and in realistic computer simulations. Model neurons fire repetitively in response to current injection. The Ca2+ current seems essential for repetitive firing. The fast K+ current appears mainly to control spike width, whereas the slow K+ current exerts a powerful influence on repetitive firing. These predictions from the model have been confirmed by the use of specific pharmacological blockers of the fast and slow K+ currents. Both the model network and the real spinal locomotor circuit appear to tolerate a wide variation in the relative strengths of the component synapses but are very sensitive to the magnitudes of the voltage-gated currents. In particular the slow K+ current, despite being a small component of the total outward current, plays a critical role in stabilizing the motor pattern. Like many other rhythmic motor patterns, swimming in the Xenopus embryo is episodic; it undergoes run-down and self-termination even in the absence of sensory inputs. The slow Ca2(+)-dependent K+ current appears to play a role in the self-termination of swimming. However, intrinsic modulation mediated by the release of ATP and production of adenosine in the extracellular space appears to be a very powerful determinant of run-down of the motor pattern.","In response to a central nervous system trauma surviving neurons reorganize their connections and form new synapses that replace those lost by the lesion. A well established in vivo system for the analysis of this lesion-induced plasticity is the reorganization of the fascia dentata following unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions in rats. After general considerations of neuronal reorganization following a central nervous system trauma, this review focuses on the sprouting of single fibres in the rat hippocampus after entorhinal lesion and the molecular factors which may regulate this process. First, the connectivity of the fascia dentata in control animals is reviewed and previously unknown commissural fibers to the outer molecular layer and entorhinal fibres to the inner molecular layer are characterized. Second, sprouting of commissural and crossed entorhinal fibres after entorhinal cortex lesion is described. Single fibres sprout by forming additional collaterals, axonal extensions, boutons, and tangle-like axon formations. It is pointed out that the sprouting after entorhinal lesion mainly involves unlesioned fibre systems terminating within the layer of fibre degeneration and is therefore layer-specific. Third, molecular changes associated with axonal growth and synapse formation are considered. In this context, the role of adhesion molecules, glial cells, and neurotrophic factors for the sprouting process are discussed. Finally, an involvement of sprouting processes in the formation of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease is reviewed and discussed with regard to the axonal tangle-like formations observed after entorhinal cortex lesion.","The growth-associated protein B-50 (GAP-43) is a presynaptic protein. Its expression is largely restricted to the nervous system. B-50 is frequently used as a marker for sprouting, because it is located in growth cones, maximally expressed during nervous system development and re-induced in injured and regenerating neural tissues. The B-50 gene is highly conserved during evolution. The B-50 gene contains two promoters and three exons which specify functional domains of the protein. The first exon encoding the 1-10 sequence, harbors the palmitoylation site for attachment to the axolemma and the minimal domain for interaction with G0 protein. The second exon contains the ""GAP module"", including the calmodulin binding and the protein kinase C phosphorylation domain which is shared by the family of IQ proteins. Downstream sequences of the second and non-coding sequences in the third exon encode species variability. The third exon also contains a conserved domain for phosphorylation by casein kinase II. Functional interference experiments using antisense oligonucleotides or antibodies, have shown inhibition of neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter release. Overexpression of B-50 in cells or transgenic mice results in excessive sprouting. The various interactions, specified by the structural domains, are thought to underlie the role of B-50 in synaptic plasticity, participating in membrane extension during neuritogenesis, in neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation. Apparently, B-50 null-mutant mice do not display gross phenotypic changes of the nervous system, although the B-50 deletion affects neuronal pathfinding and reduces postnatal survival. The experimental evidence suggests that neuronal morphology and communication are critically modulated by, but not absolutely dependent on, (enhanced) B-50 presence.","Recent immunoelectron microscopic studies have revealed a low frequency of synaptic membrane differentiations on ACh (ChAT-immunostained) axon terminals (boutons or varicosities) in adult rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and neostriatum, suggesting that, besides synaptic transmission, diffuse transmission by ACh prevails in many regions of the CNS. Cytological analysis of the immediate micro-environment of these ACh terminals, as well as currently available immunocytochemical data on the cellular and subcellular distribution of ACh receptors, is congruent with this view. At least in brain regions densely innervated by ACh neurons, a further aspect of the diffuse transmission paradigm is envisaged: the existence of an ambient level of ACh in the extracellular space, to which all tissue elements would be permanently exposed. Recent experimental data on the various molecular forms of AChE and their presumptive role at the neuromuscular junction support this hypothesis. As in the peripheral nervous system, degradation of ACh by the prevalent G4 form of AChE in the CNS would primarily serve to keep the extrasynaptic, ambient level of ACh within physiological limits, rather than totally eliminate ACh from synaptic clefts. Long-lasting and widespread electrophysiological effects imputable to ACh in the CNS might be explained in this manner. The notions of diffuse transmission and of an ambient level of ACh in the CNS could also be of clinical relevance, in accounting for the production and nature of certain cholinergic deficits and the efficacy of substitution therapies.","In the frog, unitary electrophysiological recordings have been extensively used to investigate odor processing along the olfactory pathways. From the responses of primary second-order neurons, neuroreceptor and mitral cells, odor stimuli could be classified in qualitative groups, revealing that neuronal discriminative mechanisms are partly based on the structure of odor molecule. In the olfactory bulb, thanks both to the anatomical convergence of primary afferences and intrinsic network properties, mitral cells have been demonstrated to gain in odor discrimination and detection power abilities. GABAergic bulbar interneurons were found to be involved in the control of mitral cell excitability, adjusting response thresholds and duration and promoting a progressive increase of burst discharges with stimulus concentration. Otherwise, dopamine was observed to shunt off mitral cell spontaneous activity without altering their odor responsivity properties. Dopamine was demonstrated to act through D2 receptors. Matching anatomical and electrophysiological data, D2 receptors are assumed to be localized on mitral cells. The frog olfactory cortex neurons, silent at rest, could be segregated in two functional groups basing on their odor response properties. The first group shared most intensity coding properties with mitral cells while showing a lower discriminative power, similar to that of neuroreceptor cells. By contrast, the second group provided only minimal intensity coding and, basing on its high discrimination power, was assumed to be mainly devoted to odor discrimination. Thus, along the olfactory pathways, intensity and quality odor parameters which are simultaneously encoded by a neuroreceptor or mitral cell, become specified by two distinct populations in the cortex.","Dystrophin is a plasma membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein of the spectrin superfamily. The dystrophin cytoskeleton has been first characterized in muscle. Muscular 427 kDa dystrophin binds to subplasmalemmal actin filaments via its amino-terminal domain. The carboxy-terminus of dystrophin binds to a plasma membrane anchor, beta-dystroglycan, which is associated on the external side with the extracellular matrix receptor, alpha-dystroglycan, that binds to the basal lamina proteins laminin-1, laminin-2, and agrin. In the muscle, the dystroglycan complex is associated with the sarcoglycan complex that consists of several glycosylated, integral membrane proteins. The absence or functional deficiency of the dystrophin cytoskeleton is the cause of several types of muscular dystrophies including the lethal Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one of the most severe and most common genetic disorders of man. The dystrophin complex is believed to stabilize the plasma membrane during cycles of contraction and relaxation. Muscular dystrophin and several types of dystrophin variants are also present in extramuscular tissues, e.g. in distinct regions of the central nervous systems including the retina. Absence of dystrophin from these sites is believed to be responsible for some extramuscular symptoms of DMD, e.g. mental retardation and disturbances in retinal electrophysiology (reduced b-wave in electroretinograms). The reduced b-wave in electroretinograms indicated a disturbance of neurotransmission between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells. At least two different dystrophin variants are present in photoreceptor synaptic complexes. One of these dystrophins (Dp260) is virtually exclusively expressed in the retina. In the neuroretina, dystrophin is found in significant amounts in the invaginated photoreceptor synaptic complexes. At this location dystrophin colocalizes with dystroglycan. Agrin, an extracellular ligand of alpha-dystroglycan, is also present at this location whereas the proteins of the sarcoglycan complex appear to be absent in photoreceptor synaptic complexes. Dystrophin and dystroglycan are located distal from the ribbon-containing active synaptic zones where both proteins are restricted to the photoreceptor plasma membrane bordering on the lateral sides of the synaptic invagination. In addition, some neuronal profiles of the postsynaptic complex also contain dystrophin and beta-dystroglycan. These profiles appear to belong at least in part to projections of the photoreceptor terminals into the postsynaptic dendritic complex. In view of the abnormal neurotransmission between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells in DMD patients the dystrophin/beta-dystroglycan-containing projections of photoreceptor presynaptic terminals into the postsynaptic dendritic plexus might somehow modify the ON-bipolar pathway. Another retinal site associated with dystrophin/beta-dystropglycan is the plasma membrane of Müller cells where dystrophin/beta-dystroglycan appear to be present at particular high concentrations. At this location the dystrophin/dystroglycan complex may play a role in the attachment of the retina to the vitreous, and, under pathological conditions, in traction-induced retinal detachment.","Actions are a subclass of human behaviours which are distinguished, on a modest view, by certain antecedent mental and neural processes and events, including desires and beliefs. Libertarian philosophies have taken a less modest view, according to which some actions come under the influence of individual persons in a way distinct from being the necessary effect of a sequence of psychoneural events. Determinism claims necessary connections between sequences of events and conditions, including those sequences that involve desires and beliefs and subsequent actions. Even if a certain interpretation of modern physics shows determinism to be false, the sense of personal influence over action which libertarians have remains obscure. It is not enlightened by the physicist's idea of inexplicable fluctuations between courses of events with greater or lesser probabilities. If libertarianism remains obscure, so do the grounds for an approach to explaining behaviour which might be called ""explanatory individualism"". According to the latter stance, the local outcomes of actions and larger social tendencies are only properly explained in terms of the choices of individuals, rather than, for example, their neural or environmental antecedents. Again, bare indeterminism will not help to supply the required grounds. A more justifiable stance is ""explanatory pluralism"", a doctrine which denies the intrinsic priority of individualistic modes of explanation over those which focus on psychoneural, environmental, social or genetic conditions. It is stressed that on a sensible pluralism, any determinism which correctly describes the history of actions would be no more ""genetic"", than indeterminism could be ""individualistic"".","The aim of this paper is to: i) review the behavioural, electrophysiological, pharmacological and biochemical evidence relating to the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the vestibular compensation process which follows unilateral peripheral vestibular deafferentation (UVD); and ii) suggest a unifying hypothesis based on this literature and recent studies of long-term depression (LTD)-like phenomena in the brainstem vestibular nucleus complex (VNC). It is suggested that NMDA receptors may induce a form of heterosynaptic LTD in the ipsilateral VNC, which is partly responsible for the extent of the hypoactivity which occurs immediately following UVD, and the severity of the associated vestibular syndrome. It is also suggested that vestibular compensation may develop as this LTD dissipates, allowing remaining synaptic inputs and the intrinsic properties of ipsilateral VNC neurons to re-establish the resting activity which is responsible for static vestibular compensation. It is argued that this hypothesis accounts for the majority of the available data on NMDA receptors in relation to vestibular compensation, and may serve as a useful working hypothesis, in order to formulate further experiments to investigate the contribution of NMDA receptors to the compensation process.","The ventral nerve photoreceptor of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus has been used for many years to investigate basic mechanisms of invertebrate phototransduction. The activation of rhodopsin leads in visual cells of invertebrates to an enzyme cascade at the end of which ion channels in the plasma membrane are transiently opened. This allows an influx of cations resulting in a depolarization of the photoreceptor cell. The receptor current of the Limulus ventral photoreceptor consists of three components which differ in several aspects, such as the time course of activation, the time course of recovery from light adaptation, and the reversal potential. Each component is influenced in a different, characteristic way by various pharmacological manipulations. In addition, at least two types of single photon-evoked events (bumps) and three elementary channel conductances are observed in this photoreceptor cell. These findings suggest that the receptor current components are controlled by three different light-activated enzymatic pathways using three different ligands to increase membrane conductance. Probably one of these ligands is cyclic GMP, another one is activated via the IP3-cascade and calcium, the third one might be cyclic AMP. Calcium ions are very important for the excitation and adaptation of visual cells in invertebrates. The extracellular and intracellular calcium concentrations determine the functional state of the visual cell. A rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration appears to be an essential step in the excitatory transduction cascade. Cytosolic calcium is the major intracellular mediator of adaptation. If the cytosolic calcium level exceeds a certain threshold value after exposure to light it causes the desensitization of the visual cell. On the other hand, from a slight rise in cytosolic calcium facilitation results, i.e. increased sensitivity of the photoreceptor.","In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the cognitive and neuroanatomical basis of high-level planning behaviour through a combination of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological and functional neuroimaging approaches. In this article, early evidence suggesting a relationship between planning impairments and damage to the frontal lobe is reviewed and several contemporary studies of planning behaviour in patients with circumscribed frontal lobe excisions are described in detail. These neuropsychological investigations, together with recent functional neuroimaging studies of normal control subjects, have identified a specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex of humans which appears to be critically involved in the cognitive processes that mediate efficient planning. The functions of this region, both in cognitive planning and in related functions such as working memory, are then discussed in the context of a general theoretical framework for understanding the functional organization of ""executive"" processes within the human lateral frontal cortex. In the final sections, the relationship between the planning deficits observed after intrinsic frontal lobe damage and those exhibited by patients with neuropathology of primarily sub-cortical origin, such as Parkinson's disease, is discussed. A central model for much of this work has been the concept of cortico-striatal circuitry which emphasizes the relationship between the neocortex and the striatum. The combined evidence from comparative studies in patients and from functional neuroimaging studies on Parkinson's disease suggests that altered cortico-striatal interactions may disrupt normal planning function at a number of levels, possibly consequent upon intrinsic striatal pathology on the one hand and the partial loss of (frontal) cortical input to the basal ganglia on the other.","Firstly, the noetic value of the ontogenetic approach to the problems of learning and memory is emphasized; then the heterochrony and uneven time course of the development of neural systems are accentuated, which fully holds for the basic cognitive functions. Contrary to a broadly accepted opinion, that inhibitory learning develops later in the ontogeny, using a special method of passive avoidance (with gentle air flow inciting the new-born animal to move), the ability of new-born rats to learn an inhibitory reaction even several hours after delivery and remember it for 24 hr has been proven; special control experiments have excluded any possibility that it is a non-specific reaction. To get it, the specific features of the neonatal organism are to be considered and its functional capabilities not to be overlooked. This conditioned reaction as well as its 24 hr memory develops with a temporary reversal during several postnatal days, needing decreasing numbers of trials to meet the criteria. In the analysis of their mechanisms, it has been shown that adequate functioning of peripheral receptor zones providing afferent inputs from somatosensory areas of the conditioned stimulus is considerably involved in their establishment. Increased dendritic branching has been found in hippocampus and Meynert nucleus the following day after learning in the neonatal period. Special attention is devoted to the involvement of transmitters and/or modulators; the action of acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine and nitric oxide has been discovered during the first postnatal hours; their application after meeting criteria displays a time and age dependent effect with a general characteristic of memory improvement. Neonatal learning under nitric oxide influence changes nitric oxide-synthase content in the brain. Increasing dopamine and nitric oxide availability in the brain improves both learning and memory, and their joint application positively alleviates these phenomena further. Dopamine and its D1 receptor agonists counterbalance decreased nitric oxide after nitric oxide synthase blockade; increased nitric oxide in brain and dopamine receptor antagonists similarly counterbalance each other.","Regeneration of severed axons within the central nervous system of adult mammals does not normally occur with any degree of success. During development, however, newly forming projections must send axons to distant sites and form appropriate connections with their targets: successful regeneration has been observed during this critical period. The opossum central nervous system develops during early postnatal life and has provided a useful experimental model to investigate this specialized mode of axonal regeneration in mammals. The presence of a clear decision point at the optic chiasm has also provided a useful site at which to investigate the navigational capacity of retinal ganglion cells regenerating along the optic nerve during this critical period. Regeneration failure occurs as the central nervous system progresses from this permissive, developing state to a mature, non-permissive adult state. Studies into the behaviour of glial and neuronal elements around this transition period can help elucidate some of the factors that need to be overcome if regeneration is ever to become successful in adult mammals. The regeneration characteristics of a lesioned projection are dependent upon its developmental stage and are also related to the proximity of axotomy along its pathway. A system of staging is proposed to correlate observations in the opossum optic nerve to other mammalian systems.","Recent findings in auditory research have significantly changed our views of the processes involved in hearing. Novel techniques and new approaches to investigate the mammalian cochlea have expanded our knowledge about the mechanical events occurring at physiologically relevant stimulus intensities. Experiments performed in the apical, low-frequency regions demonstrate that although there is a change in the mechanical responses along the cochlea, the fundamental characteristics are similar across the frequency range. The mechanical responses to sound stimulation exhibit tuning properties comparable to those measured intracellularly or from nerve fibres. Non-linearities in the mechanical responses have now clearly been observed at all cochlear locations. The mechanics of the cochlea are vulnerable, and dramatic changes are seen especially when the sensory hair cells are affected, for example, following acoustic overstimulation or exposure to ototoxic compounds such as furosemide. The results suggest that there is a sharply tuned and vulnerable response related to the hair cells, superimposed on a more robust, broadly tuned response. Studies of the micromechanical behaviour down to the cellular level have demonstrated significant differences radially across the hearing organ and have provided new information on the important mechanical interactions with the tectorial membrane. There is now ample evidence of reverse transduction in the auditory periphery, i.e. the cochlea does not only receive and detect mechanical stimuli but can itself produce mechanical motion. Hence, it has been shown that electrical stimulation elicits motion within the cochlea very similar to that evoked by sound. In addition, the presence of acoustically-evoked displacements of the hearing organ have now been demonstrated by several laboratories.","Monkeys and humans are able to perform different types of slow eye movements. The analysis of the eye movement parameters, as well as the investigation of the neuronal activity underlying the execution of slow eye movements, offer an excellent opportunity to study higher brain functions such as motion processing, sensorimotor integration, and predictive mechanisms as well as neuronal plasticity and motor learning. As an example, since there exists a tight connection between the execution of slow eye movements and the processing of any kind of motion, these eye movements can be used as a biological, behavioural probe for the neuronal processing of motion. Global visual motion elicits optokinetic nystagmus, acting as a visual gaze stabilization system. The underlying neuronal substrate consists mainly of the cortico-pretecto-olivo-cerebellar pathway. Additionally, another gaze stabilization system depends on the vestibular input known as the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The interactions between the visual and vestibular stabilization system are essential to fulfil the plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex representing a simple form of learning. Local visual motion is a necessary prerequisite for the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements which depend on the cortico-pontino-cerebellar pathway. In the wake of saccades, short-latency eye movements can be elicited by brief movements of the visual scene. Finally, eye movements directed to objects in different planes of depth consist of slow movements also. Although there is some overlap in the neuronal substrates underlying these different types of slow eye movements, there are brain areas whose activity can be associated exclusively with the execution of a special type of slow eye movement.","A model system for syncytial integration is the outer vertebrate retina, where graded signals or electrotonic potentials interact laterally via gap junctions to form an integrated response that is relayed by chemical synapses to the next layer of interconnected cells. Morphological and physiological experiments confirm that bipolar cells form quasisyncytial lattices, and so this review will aim to address two important issues: the function of coupling in visual information processing and the construction of a robust mathematical model that can adequately simulate signal spread in the bipolar cell syncytium. It is shown that the role of coupling in bipolar cells differs from that associated in the presynaptic networks, namely, loss in spatial resolution in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The intrinsic membrane properties of bipolar cells which give rise to voltage-dependent currents are inactive over the normal in vivo operating range of membrane potential and may be shunted as a direct result of electrotonic coupling, suppressing any possibility of action potential propagation in the bipolar cell syncytium. It is therefore speculated that the mechanisms underlying processing of information in bipolar networks are dependent on the structure of bipolar cells and in particular, on the presence of gap junctions. It is proposed that a three-dimensional model which incorporates the spatial properties of each bipolar cell in the network in the form of a leaky cable is the most likely model to simulate signal spread in the bipolar cell syncytium in vivo. This is because discrete network models represent each bipolar cell in the syncytium as isopotential units without any spatial structure, and thus are unable to reproduce the temporal characteristics of electrotonic potential spread within the central receptive field of bipolar cells.","gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the inhibitory transmitter released at Purkinje cell axon terminals in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Neurons in DCN also receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs from the inferior olive. The output of DCN neurons, which depends on the balance between excitation and inhibition on these cells, is involved in cerebellar control of motor coordination. Plasticity of synaptic transmission observed in other areas of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has received wide attention. If GABA-ergic and/or glutamatergic synapses in DCN also undergo plasticity, it would have major implications for cerebellar function. In this review, literature evidence for GABA-ergic synaptic transmission in DCN as well as its plasticity are discussed. Studies indicate that fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and currents (IPSCs) in neurons of DCN are mediated by GABAA receptors. While GABAB receptors are present in DCN, they do not appear to be activated by Purkinje cell axons. The IPSPs undergo paired-pulse, as well as frequency-dependent, depressions. In addition, tetanic stimulation of inputs can induce a long-term depression (LTD) of the IPSPs and IPSCs. Excitatory synapses do not appear to undergo long-term potentiation or LTD. The LTD of the IPSP is not input-specific, as it can be induced heterosynaptically and is associated with a reduced response of DCN neurons to a GABAA receptor agonist. Postsynaptic Ca2+ and protein phosphatases appear to contribute to the LTD. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-gated, as well as the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are proposed to be sources of the Ca2+. It is suggested that LTD of GABA-ergic transmission, by regulating DCN output, can modulate cerebellar function.","Twenty to 30% of patients with epilepsy develop chronic or intractable epilepsy, i.e. the seizures persist despite accurate diagnosis and carefully monitored treatment with antiepileptic drugs. It is still not known why and how epilepsy becomes an intractable disorder in such patients, while other patients with seemingly identical seizure types can achieve control of seizures with medication. Experimental epilepsy research has generated new neurophysiological, neurochemical and neuropharmacological approaches but is still hampered by a lack of adequate experimental models of chronic intractable epilepsy. An animal model of epilepsy allowing selection of pharmacoresistant and pharmacosensitive subgroups of animals would be a valuable tool to study mechanisms of intractability and to develop more effective treatment strategies. This review concentrates on identifying animal models that mimic patterns of pharmacological resistance in humans with epilepsy. Two models seem to be interesting in this regard, epileptic dogs with different types of spontaneous recurrent seizures and amygdala-kindled rats. In both models, animals which do not respond to repeated or chronic administration of antiepileptic drugs (non-responders) can be separated from animals in whom antiepileptics are effective (responders). Unfortunately, the dog model has several inherent logistical problems, whereas pharmacoresistant subgroups of kindled rats offer a unique tool to study why seizures become intractable, particularly because pathophysiologically processes in these resistant rats can be compared directly with those of kindled rats which respond to treatment. Furthermore, the new rat model can be used to identify predictors of intractability during onset of treatment with an antiepileptic drug and is a valuable addendum to the battery of animal models used in preclinical evaluation of novel drugs. In addition to pharmacoresistant epileptic dogs and kindled rats, several other potential models of intractable epilepsy are described to stimulate and outline areas for future research.","Nicotine is a very widely used drug of abuse, which exerts a number of neurovegetative, behavioural and psychological effects by interacting with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NAChRs). These receptors are distributed widely in human brain and ganglia, and form a family of ACh-gated ion channels of different subtypes, each of which has a specific pharmacology and physiology. As human NAChRs have been implicated in a number of human central nervous system disorders (including the neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy), they are suitable potential targets for rational drug therapy. Much of our current knowledge about the structure and function of NAChRs comes from studies carried out in other species, such as rodents and chicks, and information concerning human nicotinic receptors is still incomplete and scattered in the literature. Nevertheless, it is already evident that there are a number of differences in the anatomical distribution, physiology, pharmacology, and expression regulation of certain subtypes between the nicotinic systems of humans and other species. This review will attempt to survey the major achievements reached in the study of the structure and function of NAChRs by examining the molecular basis of their functional diversity viewed mainly from pharmacological and biochemical perspectives. It will also summarize our current knowledge concerning the structure and function of the NAChRs expressed by other species, and the newly discovered drugs used to classify their numerous subtypes. Finally, the role of NAChRs in behaviour and pathology will be considered.","The knowledge accumulated about the biochemistry of the synapsis in the last decades completely changes the notion of brain processing founded exclusively over an electrical mechanism, toward that supported by a complex chemical message exchange occurring both locally, at the synaptic site, as well as at other localities, depending on the solubility of the involved chemical substances in the extracellular compartment. These biochemical transactions support a rich symbolic processing of the information both encoded by the genes and provided by actual data collected from the surrounding environment, by means of either special molecular or cellular receptor systems. In this processing, molecules play the role of symbols and chemical affinity shared by them specifies the syntax for symbol manipulation in order to process and to produce chemical messages. In this context, neurons are conceived as message-exchanging agents. Chemical strings are produced and stored at defined places, and ionic currents are used to speed up message delivery. Synaptic transactions can no longer be assumed to correspond to a simple process of propagating numbers powered by a factor measuring the presynaptic capacity to influence the postsynaptic electrical activity, but they must be modeled by more powerful formal tools supporting both numerical and symbolic calculations. It is proposed here that formal language theory is the adequate mathematical tool to handle such symbolic processing. The purpose of the present review is therefore: (a) to discuss the relevant and recent literature about trophic factors, signal transduction mechanisms, neuromodulators and neurotransmitters in order (b) to point out the common features of these correlated processes; and (c) to show how they may be organized into a formal model supported by the theory of fuzzy formal languages (d) to model the brain as a distributed intelligent problem solver.","Higher organisms perceive information about external or internal physical or chemical stimuli with specialized sensors that encode characteristics of that stimulus by a train of action potentials. Usually, the location and modality of the stimulus is represented by the location and specificity of the receptor and the intensity of the stimulus and its temporal modulation is thought to be encoded by the instantaneous firing rate. Recent studies have shown that, primarily in cortical structures, special features of a stimulus also are represented in the temporal pattern of spike activity. Typical attributes of this time structure are oscillatory patterns of activity and synchronous discharges in spatially distributed neurons that respond to inputs evoked by a coherent object. The origin and functional significance of this kind of activity is less clear. Cortical, subcortical and even very peripheral sources seem to be involved. Most of the relevant studies were devoted to the mammalian visual system and cortical findings on temporally structured activity were reviewed recently (Eckhorn, 1994, Progr. Brain Res., Vol. 102, pp. 405-426; Singer and Gray, 1995, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., Vol. 18, pp. 555-586). Therefore, this article is designed to give an overview, especially of those studies concerned with the temporal structure of visual activity in subcortical centers of the primary visual pathway, which are the retina and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We discuss the mechanisms that possibly contribute to the generation and modulation of the subcortical activity time structure and we try to relate to each other the subcortical and cortical patterns of sensory activity.","Reports on habituation from the last part of the nineteenth and the first part of this century are reviewed. Publications are selected according to their significance for the understanding of the properties that characterize habituation. Reports that have contributed to the establishment of a causative link between habituation and synaptic depression are also reviewed. A kinetic analysis of experimental cases of habituation is made for different reflexes in a number of species. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of two distinct subcategories of habituation: a slow and a fast version. Each category has a remarkably narrow range of kinetic variability, regardless of species and type of reflex. In one particular reflex, the tentacle withdrawal of Helix pomatia, both versions of habituation are displayed in response to different stimulation paradigms. On the basis of the kinetic analysis, a new criterion for identification of habituation is suggested.","Determination of neurotransmitter phenotype in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has been intensively characterized. However, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular and biochemical events involved in determination of transmitter phenotype in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been well established that nerve growth factors regulate cell growth and differentiation. They are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in many decision-making steps during development. Published data suggest that neurotransmitter phenotype is determined largely by exogenous stimuli, such as nerve growth factors--acidic/basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, neurotrophins, etc., working in concert with the genetic programmes. They exert potent effects independently or synergistically with other molecules by acting either on neural precursor cells or differentiated neuronal cells. However, the process of transmitter phenotype determination in the CNS is only beginning to be understood, with more uncharacterized substances, with considerable potency in this respect being reported and in need of isolation and further study. These studies will bring great advances in our existing knowledge of brain development and have potential value for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.","The natural ability of the adult central nervous system of higher vertebrates to recover from injury is highly limited. This limitation is most likely due to an inhospitable environment and/or intrinsic incapacities of the neurons to re-extend their neurites after injury or axotomy. The rat corticospinal tract is the largest tract leading from brain to spinal cord and is often used as a model in developmental and regeneration studies. The extensive know-how of factors involved in the development of the corticospinal tract did provide the foundation for many studies on corticospinal tract regrowth after injury in the adult spinal cord. The results of these experiments, as discussed in this review, have led to important contributions to the further understanding of central nervous system regeneration.","The past decade has witnessed an enormous increase in our knowledge of the variety and complexity of neuropathological and neurochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease. Although the disease is characterized by multiple deficits of neurotransmitters in the brain, this overview emphasizes the structural and neurochemical localization of the elements of the acetylcholine system (choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, and muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) in the non-demented brain and in Alzheimer's disease brain samples. The results demonstrate a great variation in the distribution of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, and the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the different brain areas, nuclei and subnuclei. When stratification is present in certain brain regions (olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, etc.), differences can be detected as regards the laminar distribution of the elements of the acetylcholine system. Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system. There is evidence that the most affected areas include the cortex, the entorhinal area, the hippocampus, the ventral striatum and the basal part of the forebrain. Other brain areas are less affected. The fact that the acetylcholine system, which plays a significant role in the memory function, is seriously impaired in Alzheimer's disease has accelerated work on the development of new drugs for treatment of the disease of the 20th century.","The piriform cortex (PCx) is a phylogenetically old brain structure which presents characteristics of a content-addressable memory. Taking into account its particular anatomo-functional organization, we hypothesized that this cortex could behave rather as an assembly of different functional units than as a functionally homogeneous structure. This hypothesis was tested by using both anatomical and functional approaches. Immunohistological and tracing experiments demonstrated that both the connections of the PCx with the higher nervous centres, and its monoaminergic and cholinergic modulatory afferents exhibited a heterogeneous distribution. Then, optical monitoring of its neuronal activity with a voltage-sensitive dye pointed out that the PCx is a functionally heterogeneous structure. Electrical stimulations of the olfactory bulb showed that the inhibitory processes which control the cortical responsiveness were not identical in all the PCx area. Two different functional areas at least could be distinguished: in the ventromedial PCx, the afferent activity is privileged since the level of inhibition of disynaptic activation remained large during repetitive stimuli. Contrarily, in the posterior PCx, the disynaptic activity remained unchanged in response to successive stimulations and the responses of neighbouring sites were statistically more synchronized than in its anterior part. Moreover, a late depolarization wave was significantly larger in the posterior PCx. These data are in good agreement with the results provided by computational models of the PCx. In the future, theoretical and experimental investigations of this cortex will be useful for understanding olfactory information processing and as a model of brain functioning at the neocortical level as well.","This article provides a simple introduction to the simulation of voltage-dependent ion conductances in both macroscopic and single-channel modes. Only Markovian (time-independent) systems are considered. The programmes listed are written in Microsoft QBasic or QuickBASIC but versions in other languages are available. The Hodgkin-Huxley Na+ current is used as a starting system for which an explicit macroscopic solution may be obtained and compared with the results of numerical simulations employing 4th order Runge-Kutta integration. Non-Hodgkin-Huxley behaviour such as voltage-independent inactivation and double exponential current decay are discussed and simulated. A stochastic programme is used to simulate single channel behaviour. The problems and methodologies involved in fitting experimental data using complex kinetic schemes are briefly discussed, as are alternative sources of simulation software.","The serotonergic system, because of very diffuse projections throughout the central nervous system, has been implicated in numerous functions including nociception, analgesia, sleep-wakefulness and autonomic regulation. Despite an abundant literature indicating the presence of neurotensin-containing (neurotensinergic) neurons, fibres and terminals in most areas containing serotonergic neurons, little is known about the possible relationship between serotonergic and neurotensinergic systems. The purpose of this review is (i) to summarize current knowledge on the anatomical relation between neurotensinergic and serotonergic system, (ii) to summarize current knowledge on the action of neurotensin on serotonergic neurons and (iii) to discuss the possible physiological relevance of this action. Neurotensin-containing cell bodies can be found in the most rostral raphe nuclei. There are neurotensin-containing fibres and terminals in all raphe nuclei. Raphe nuclei have also been shown to contain neurotensin-receptor binding sites. In the dorsal raphe nucleus, neurotensin induces a concentration-dependent increase in the firing rate of a subpopulation of serotonergic neurons. The neurotensin-induced excitation, which is selectively blocked by the non-peptide neurotensin receptor antagonist SR 48692, is observed mainly in the ventral part of the nucleus. Most serotonergic neurons show marked desensitization to neurotensin, even at low concentrations. In intracellular experiments, neurotensin induces an inward current, associated in some cases with a decrease in apparent input conductance, which is occluded by supramaximal concentrations of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. In rare cases, neurotensin induces an excitation of GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons. Since the neurotensinergic system has also been implicated in nociception, analgesia, sleep-wakefulness, and autonomic regulation, the review discusses the possibility that part of this regulation could involve the activation of the serotonergic system.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the U.K. The clinical diagnosis of the specific disease resulting in dementia is unreliable and thus a definitive diagnosis of AD is best made in conjunction with post-mortem findings of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Alzheimer's disease is neuropathologically indistinguishable in the young and old, but has been divided arbitrarily into early- and late-onset disease using age cut-offs of 60 or 65 years. Twin and family studies suggest that genetic factors play a major role in its aetiology. This review considers the three loci which have been shown to be associated with early-onset AD: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin (PS)-1 and PS-2. Mutations in these genes seem to be associated with overproduction of the 42-amino acid form of beta-amyloid, suggesting that this may be a central pathological process in AD. The impact of the different apo E alleles on the risks for late- and early-onset AD is discussed and compared with other dementing conditions. Recent analyses suggest that there are likely to be other genes besides apo E which impact on late-onset AD risk. The possible roles in AD of the mitochondrial mutation at position 4336, the PS intron 8 polymorphism, and variants in the alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and VLDL-receptor genes, are considered.","Coherent high-frequency neuronal activity has been proposed as a physiological indicator of perceptual and higher cognitive processes. Some of these processes can only be investigated in humans and the use of non-invasive recording techniques appears to be a prerequisite for investigating their physiological substrate in the healthy human brain. After addressing methodological issues in the non-invasive recording of high-frequency responses, we summarize studies indicating co-occurrence of neuronal synchrony of single cells exhibiting rhythmic activity at high frequencies, oscillations in the local field potential and dynamics in high frequencies recorded using high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We then review EEG and MEG studies of attention, perception, and language processing in humans indicating that dynamics in the high-frequency range > 20 Hz reflect specific cognitive processes. Types of high-frequency (HF) activity can be distinguished according to their latency after stimulus onset, stimulus-locking, cortical topography and frequency. There appears to be a systematic relationship between specific cognitive processes and types of HF activity. The findings are related to recent theories about the generation of HF activity and their possible role in binding of stimulus features. Dynamics of HF cortical activity reflecting higher cognitive processes can be accounted for based on the assumption that the elements of cognitive processing, e.g. visual objects and words, are organized in the brain as distributed neuronal assemblies with defined cortical topographies generating well-timed spatio-temporal activity patterns.","Nerve fibers which appear beaded (varicose, spindle-shaped, etc.) are often considered the result of pathology, or a preparation artifact. However, beading can be promptly elicited in fresh normal nerve by a mild stretch and revealed by fast-freezing and freeze-substitution, or by aldehyde fixating at a temperature near 0 degree C (cold-fixation). The key change in beading are the constrictions, wherein the axon is much reduced in diameter. Axoplasmic fluid and soluble components are shifted from the constrictions into the expansions leaving behind compacted microtubules and neurofilaments. Labeled cytoskeletal proteins carried down by slow axonal transport are seen to move with the soluble components and not to have been incorporated into and remain with, the cytoskeletal organelles on beading the fibers. Lipids and other components of the myelin sheath are also shifted from the constrictions into the expansions, with preservation of its fine structure and thickness. Additionally, myelin intrusions into the axons are produced and a localized bulging into the axon termed ""leafing"". The beading constrictions do not arise from the myelin sheath: beading occurs in the axons of unmyelinated fibers. It does not depend on the axonal cytoskeleton: exposure of nerves in vitro to beta, beta'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) disaggregates the cytoskeletal organelles and even augments beading. The hypothesis advanced was that the beading constrictions are due to the membrane skeleton; the subaxolemmal network comprised of spectrin/fodrin, actin, ankyrin, integrins and other transmembrane proteins. The mechanism can be activated directly by neurotoxins, metabolic changes, and by an interruption of axoplasmic transport producing Wallerian degeneration.","Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a member of the neuropoietic cytokine family, initially was described in terms of its activities in the immune system and during inflammation. Accumulating evidence supports an essential role of IL-6 in the development, differentiation, regeneration and degeneration of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Major sites of IL-6 synthesis are neurons and glial cells. Interleukin-6 functions are mediated by a specific receptor system composed of a binding site and a signal transducer. This receptor system can be modulated by a complex of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor acting as agonist. The IL-6 can exert completely opposite actions on neurons, triggering either neuronal survival after injury or causing neuronal degeneration and cell death in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Development of selective IL-6 agonists and antagonists, as well as the usage of soluble IL-6 receptors, offers new possibilities for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, optimized genetic mouse models, including transgenic and knockout animals, should help to define the physiological and pathophysiological role of IL-6 in the nervous system.","A number of different cytokines, each initially characterized on the basis of very different biological activities, all have very similar signalling pathways and share a similar tertiary structure. These cytokines include leukaemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neuronotrophic factor, oncostatin M, growth-promoting activity and cardiotrophin 1. They all have been found to regulate a number of properties of cells of the developing and mature nervous system in vitro and thus are neuroregulatory cytokines. The actions of these cytokines include regulation of neurotransmitter phenotype, differentiation of neuronal precursor cells both in the peripheral nervous system and in the spinal cord, survival of differentiated neurons, and regulation of development of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In addition, studies in animal models show that these factors can rescue sensory and motor neurons from axotomy-induced cell death, which suggests that they can act as trauma factors for injured neurons. Analysis of the expression patterns of the different neuroregulatory cytokines and their receptors reveals that the receptors are expressed throughout nervous system development and following trauma, whereas the cytokines show temporal and spatial specific expression patterns. This is consistent with the idea that specific cytokines have specific roles in neural development and repair, but that their signalling pathways are shared. The phenotypes of the receptor knockouts show clear deficits in nervous system development, indicating a crucial role for LIF receptor signalling. Knockouts of individual cytokines are less dramatic, but LIF and CNTF knockouts do reveal deficits in maintenance of motor neurons or following trauma. Thus, whereas LIF and CNTF have clear roles in maintenance and following trauma, it is unclear which of the cytokines is involved in nervous system development. In clinical terms, these findings add further support to the use of these cytokines in nervous system trauma and disease.","It has long been assumed that L-forms of amino acids exclusively constitute free amino acid pools in mammals. However, a variety of studies in the last decade has demonstrated that free D-aspartate and D-serine occur in mammals and may have important physiological function in mammals. Free D-serine is confined predominantly to the forebrain structure, and the distribution and development of D-serine correspond well with those of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type excitatory amino acid receptor. As D-serine acts as a potent and selective agonist for the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the NMDA receptor, it is proposed that D-serine is a potential candidate for an NMDA receptor-related glycine site agonist in mammalian brain. In contrast, widespread and transient emergence of a high concentration of free D-aspartate is observed in the brain and periphery. Since the periods of maximal emergence of D-aspartate in the brain and periphery occur during critical periods of morphological and functional maturation of the organs, D-aspartate could participate in the regulation of these regulation of these developmental processes of the organs. This review deals with the recent advances in the studies of presence of free D-aspartate and D-serine and their metabolic systems in mammals. Since D-aspartate and D-serine have been shown to potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated transmission through the glutamate binding site and the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site, respectively, and have been utilized extensively as potent and selective tools to study the excitatory amino acid system in the brain, we shall discuss also the NMDA receptor and uptake system of D-amino acids.","Over the past 20 years there has been an increasing understanding of the properties and mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy, putative learning and memory mechanisms in the mammalian brain. More recently, however, it has become apparent that synaptic activity can also elicit persistent neuronal responses not manifest as changes in synaptic strength. Some of these changes may nonetheless modify the ability of synapses to undergo strength changes in response to subsequent episodes of synaptic activity. This kind of activity-dependent modulatory plasticity we have termed ""metaplasticity"". Metaplasticity has been observed physiologically as an inhibition of LTP and concomitant facilitation of LTD by prior N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation or, conversely, a facilitation of LTP induction by prior metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. The examples of metaplasticity described to date are input specific, and last as long as several hours. The mechanisms underlying such phenomena remain to be fully characterized, although some likely possibilities are an altered N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function, altered calcium buffering, altered states of kinases or phosphatases, and a priming of protein synthesis machinery. While some details vary, experimentally observed metaplasticity bears some similarity to the ""sliding threshold"" feature of the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro model of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Metaplasticity may serve several functions including (1) providing a way for synapses to integrate a response across temporally spaced episodes of synaptic activity and (2) keeping synapses within a dynamic functional range, and thus preventing them from entering states of saturated LTP or LTD.","Tetrahydrobiopterin is an essential cofactor required for activity of nitric oxide synthases. Existing evidence suggests that, during activation of constitutive and inducible isoforms of nitric oxide synthase, tetrahydrobiopterin is needed for allosteric and redox activation of enzymatic activity. However, precise mechanisms underlying the role of tetrahydrobiopterin in regulation of nitric oxide formation is not fully understood. In cerebral and peripheral arteries, increased availability of tetrahydrobiopterin can augment production of nitric oxide. In contrast, in arteries depleted of tetrahydrobiopterin, production of nitric oxide is impaired. Proinflammatory cytokines enhance mRNA expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, GTP cyclohydrolase I and stimulate production of tetrahydrobiopterin. The ability of vascular tissues to synthesize tetrahydrobiopterin plays an important role in regulation of nitric oxide synthase under physiological conditions as well as during inflammation and sepsis. More recent studies concerning expression and function of recombinant nitric oxide synthases suggest that availability of tetrahydrobiopterin is important for production of nitric oxide in genetically engineered blood vessels. In this review, mechanisms regulating availability of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin and its role in control of vascular tone under physiological and pathological conditions will be discussed.","During the last 10 years, adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme considered to be cytosolic, has been found on the cell surface of many cells, therefore it can be considered an ectoenzyme. EctoADA, which seems to be identical to intracellular ADA and has a globular structure, does not interact with membranes but with membrane proteins. Two of these cell surface receptors for ectoADA have been identified: CD26 and A1 adenosine receptors (A1R). Apart from degradation of extracellular adenosine another functional role of ectoADA has been assigned. EctoADA is able to transmit signals when interacting with either CD26 or A1R. In this way, it acts as a co-stimulatory molecule which facilitates a variety of specific signalling events in different cell types. The heterogeneous distribution of the enzyme in the nervous system indicates that ectoADA may be a neuroregulatory molecule. On the other hand, ectoADA might act as a bridge between two different cells thus raising the possibility that it may be important for the development of the nervous system.","Astrocytes have, until recently, been thought of as the passive supporting elements of the central nervous system. However, recent developments suggest that these cells actually play a crucial and vital role in the overall physiology of the brain. Astrocytes selectively express a host of cell membrane and nuclear receptors that are responsive to various neuroactive compounds. In addition, the cell membrane has a number of important transporters for these compounds. Direct evidence for the selective co-expression of neurotransmitters, transporters on both neurons and astrocytes, provides additional evidence for metabolic compartmentation within the central nervous system. Oxidative stress as defined by the excessive production of free radicals can alter dramatically the function of the cell. The free radical nitric oxide has attracted a considerable amount of attention recently, due to its role as a physiological second messenger but also because of its neurotoxic potential when produced in excess. We provide, therefore, an in-depth discussion on how this free radical and its metabolites affect the intra and intercellular physiology of the astrocyte(s) and surrounding neurons. Finally, we look at the ways in which astrocytes can counteract the production of free radicals in general by using their antioxidant pathways. The glutathione antioxidant system will be the focus of attention, since astrocytes have an enormous capacity for, and efficiency built into this particular system.","Septal cholinergic neurons are known to play an important role in cognitive processes including learning and memory through afferent innervation of the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex. The septum contains not only cholinergic neurons but also various types of neurons including GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic neurons. Although synaptic transmission in the septum is mediated primarily by the activation of excitatory and inhibitory amino-acid receptors, it is possible that a distinct phenotype of neuron is endowed with a different type for each of the amino-acid receptors and thus they play different roles from each other, since it has been demonstrated within the septum that there is a regional distribution of various types of amino-acid receptor subunits, their expression as different combinations within a specific cell may produce receptor channels with disparate functional properties. As a first step towards knowing the various functions of septal cholinergic neurons, we characterized the functional properties of glutamate, GABA (type A; GABAA) and glycine receptor channels on cultured rat septal neurons which were histologically identified to be cholinergic. These were similar to those of receptor channels on other types of neurons, except for the actions of some neuromodulators. The septal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel was distinct in being less sensitive to Mg2+ and in a voltage-dependent action of Zn2+. The septal GABAA receptor channel exhibited a lanthanide site whose activation resulted in a positive allosteric interaction with a binding site of pentobarbital. The septal glycine receptor channel was only positively modulated by Zn2+; this action of Zn2+ was not accompanied by an inhibitory effect. Our data suggest that the amino-acid receptors on septal cholinergic neurons may play a distinct role compared to other types of neurons; this difference depends on the actions of neuromodulators and metal cations. It would be interesting to compare these effects recorded in tissue culture to those observed with septal cholinergic neurons in slice preparations.","In 1963, two substances were thought to mediate all transmission between neurons, as well as between nerve and muscle in the peripheral nervous system, namely acetylcholine and noradrenaline. This paradigm primarily was due to the research of Dale, Loewi and von Euler in the first half of the century [Dale, 1937 (Transmission of nervous effects by acetylcholine, Harvey Lect. 32, pp. 229-245)]. However, in 1963, a series of experiments were carried out using recently introduced electrophysiological techniques, which showed unequivocally for the first time that the classical paradigm was not correct. Both inhibitory and excitatory junctions between nerves and smooth muscle cells were shown to exist in which transmission was mediated by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) transmitters. In the succeeding 35 years, identification of these NANC transmitters has been a major task of neuropharmacology, with nitric oxide, neuropeptides, and purines being isolated. This review presents an historical account of the developments this century of the classical paradigm, of how it was displaced, and of the progress made in identifying the neuromuscular transmitters of the autonomic nervous system.","First-generation H1-antagonist-induced central toxicity often includes psychiatric changes, seizures and hallucinations, commonly thought to result from their central anticholinergic effects. Interference with the central functions of histamine have not been adequately addressed, despite the identification of histamine as a central neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. A synthesis of data support antagonism of H1-receptors as critical to the CNS toxicity of these drugs. The histaminergic neuronal system (HNS) is involved in a variety of global brain functions. Inherent or induced alterations in the HNS are associated with behavioral disorders. Clinical and experimental evidence support a role for the HNS in seizure protection and a relationship exits between histamine regulated systems and seizures. Histamine has important neuromodulatory influences on the central electrophysiology which underlies normal thalamocortical function. H1-antagonists block the H1-receptor-mediated reduction of a background-leakage K+ current (IKL) in central neurons. Secondary alterations in other ionic currents and alterations in synaptic responses to glutamate and GABA are produced. The non-H1 receptor-mediated effects of histamine persist in the presence of these drugs, contributing to imbalances in central electrophysiology. H1-antagonist-induced changes are similar to the electrical disturbances thought to underly epileptic seizures and may adequately explain their hallucinogenic activity. These data form the basis for this review and must be considered as a major mechanism for the CNS toxicity of the first-generation H1-antagonists.","HB-GAM is a secretory, extracellular matrix-associated protein that was isolated by screening for factors that enhance neurite outgrowth in rat brain neurons. The HB-GAM sequence clearly (about 50%) is homologous to that of MK (midkine) sequence, a protein discovered through screening for factors that mediate retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation. These lysine- and cysteine-rich sequences define a novel family of differentiation/growth factors, which are conserved in their structures from mammals to amphibians. HB-GAM is expressed strongly along axon pathways and target regions of axons during and prior to the stage of axonal growth in tissues. These findings, together with in vitro interactions with neurons, suggest that HB-GAM is a cell matrix-associated cue for growth cone migration. N-syndecan (syndecan-3) functions as a receptor/coreceptor in HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth in perinatal rat brain neurons. In addition to enhancing neurite growth in a developmentally regulated manner in early neurons, HB-GAM is accumulated at the growth cone-target interphase accompanying the onset of synaptogenesis, as evidenced by its presence at the neuromuscular junction of Xenopus and rat. In vitro studies suggest that HB-GAM functions as a local, synaptic matrix-associated factor that enhances both presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation during development. In addition, a role in adult plasticity is suggested by studies on injury-induced and activity-dependent plasticity in rat hippocampus.","Placebo is a widespread phenomenon in medicine and biology and its mechanisms are understood only partially. Most of our understanding of placebo comes from studies on pain. In particular, placebo analgesia represents a situation where the administration of a substance known to be non-analgesic produces an analgesic response when the subject is told that it is a pain killer. Several theories try to explain this effect by means of anxiety mechanisms, cognitive processes and classical conditioning. However, the placebo response is bidirectional, i.e. analgesic and algesic. In fact, if a subject is told that the ineffective substance is a hyperalgesic drug, a pain increase may occur. The negative effects of placebo are called nocebo and, in extreme cases, they lead to severe pathological conditions. The neurobiology of placebo was born when some authors discovered that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids. This claim comes from the observation that the opioid antagonist naloxone can reverse placebo analgesia. On the basis of the discovery of the anti-opioid action of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin, recent studies demonstrate that the blockade of cholecystokinin receptors potentiates the placebo analgesic response, thus suggesting an inhibitory role of cholecystokinin in placebo analgesia. Thus, by antagonizing the anti-opioid action of cholecystokinin during a placebo procedure, a potentiation of the endogenous opioid systems can be obtained.","Placode-derived general visceral afferent neurons of the nodose ganglion transmit visceral sensory information from specialized sensory endings of the vagus nerve and its branches to the nucleus of the solitary tract. These neurons are critical in relaying information such as elevations in blood pressure, changes in blood oxygenation, passage of contents through the esophagus and intestines, and distention of the heart, stomach, and lungs to the CNS for reflex maintenance of visceral functions. Multiple neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, calcium binding proteins, and other neuroactive substances are associated with neurons of the nodose ganglion. Many neurons colocalize 2 or more neuroactive substances creating the potential for complex interactions of neurochemical signals in the NTS. Neurons of the nodose ganglion also contain a variety of receptors which respond to transmitters, inflammatory mediators, and neurotrophic factors. The contents of these neurochemicals and receptors are not static as alterations in their expression are noted in response to epigenetic influences. Although not yet well understood, potential factors and mechanisms regulating neurochemical events in the nodose ganglion neurons are discussed.","Narcolepsy-cataplexy is a disabling neurological disorder that affects 1/2000 individuals. The main clinical features of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations) are currently treated using amphetamine-like compounds or modafinil and antidepressants. Pharmacological research in the area is facilitated greatly by the existence of a canine model of the disorder. The mode of action of these compounds involves presynaptic activation of adrenergic transmission for the anticataplectic effects of antidepressant compounds and presynaptic activation of dopaminergic transmission for the EEG arousal effects of amphetamine-like stimulants. The mode of action of modafmil is still uncertain, and other neurochemical systems may offer interesting avenues for therapeutic development. Pharmacological and physiological studies using the canine model have identified primary neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems that underlie the expression of abnormal REM sleep and excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy. These involve mostly the pontine and basal forebrain cholinergic, the pontine adrenergic and the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems. These studies confirm a continuing need for basic research in both human and canine narcolepsy, and new treatments that act directly at the level of the primary defect in narcolepsy might be forthcoming.","During inflammation of the central or peripheral nervous system, a high number of immunologically active molecules, including bacterial or viral products as well as host-derived cytokines, are released. Patients suffering from inflammatory CNS or PNS diseases often develop transient symptoms with a rapid recovery, which obviously cannot be accounted for by immunologically induced tissue damage. These observations led to the hypothesis that immunologically active molecules can affect directly the electrophysiological functions of neurons and glial cells. Evidence for this hypothesis came from in vitro studies showing that cytokines, such as interleukins or tumor necrosis factors, arachidonic acid and its metabolites, interfere with electrophysiological properties of neurons or glial cells. These molecules affect ion currents, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, membrane potentials, and suppress or enhance the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation. Similarly, virus proteins from human immunodeficiency virus type I were found to alter intracellular Ca2+ concentrations of neurons and astrocytes by modulating either transmitter receptors and channels or membrane transporters. Cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients contains factors which increase Na+ current inactivation and thereby reduce neuronal excitability. Immunoglobulins in sera of patients suffering from multifocal motor neuropathy and from acquired neuromyotonia interfere with nerve fibers, inducing alterations of conduction. Increased knowledge of these mechanisms will help to explain the pathogenesis of neurological symptoms and may provide a rationale for new therapeutic strategies.","Extensive lesions of the fimbria-fornix pathways and the cingular bundle deprive the hippocampus of a substantial part of its cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic afferents and, among several other behavioural alterations, induce lasting impairment of spatial learning and memory capabilities. After a brief presentation of the neuroanatomical organization of the hippocampus and the connections relevant to the topic of this article, studies which have contributed to characterize the neurochemical and behavioural aspects of the fimbria-fornix lesion ""syndrome"" with lesion techniques differing by the extent, the location or the specificity of the damage produced, are reviewed. Furthermore, several compensatory changes that may occur as a reaction to hippocampal denervation (sprouting changes in receptor sensitivity and modifications of neurotransmitter turnover in spared fibres) are described and discussed in relation with their capacity (or incapacity) to foster recovery from the lesion-induced deficits. According to this background, experiments using intrahippocampal or ""parahippocampal"" grafts to substitute for missing cholinergic, noradrenergic or serotonergic afferents are considered according to whether the reported findings concern neurochemical and/or behavioural effects. Taken together, these experiments suggest that appropriately chosen fetal neurons (or other cells such as for instance, genetically-modified fibroblasts) implanted into or close to the denervated hippocampus may substitute, at least partially, for missing hippocampal afferents with a neurochemical specificity that closely depends on the neurochemical identity of the grafted neurons. Thereby, such grafts are able not only to restore some functions as they can be detected locally, namely within the hippocampus, but also to attenuate some of the behavioural (and other types of) disturbances resulting from the lesions. In some respects, also these graft-induced behavioural effects might be considered as occurring with a neurochemically-defined specificity. Nevertheless, if a graft-induced recovery of neurochemical markers in the hippocampus seems to be a prerequisite for also behavioural recovery to be observed, this neurochemical recovery is neither the one and only condition for behavioural effects to be expressed, nor is it the one and only mechanism to account for the latter effects.","Comparative studies of behavioral responses to centrally acting drugs in inbred strains of mice which show differences in brain neurotransmitter activity represent a major strategy in the investigation of the neurochemical bases underlying behavioural expression. Moreover, these studies represent a preliminary stage in behavioral genetic research since they allow quantitative scales to be established and suggest correlations to be tested in recombinant inbred strains. The present review evaluates results obtained in mice of the C57BL/6 (C57) and DBA/2 (DBA) inbred strains which have been used for studies of the behavioral pharmacology of dopamine (DA) and investigated for the functional and anatomical characteristics of their brain DA systems. Differences between C57 and DBA strain involve susceptibility and sensitivity as well as qualitative differences in the type or direction of the behavioral effects of DA agonists. Moreover, data on strain-dependent differences for DA metabolism, release and receptor densities and distribution provide important indications about the relationship between behavioral and central effects of DA agonists and, more generally, about the involvement of brain DA in behavior. Comparative studies in C57 and DBA mice have also revealed differences in susceptibility to context-dependent, context-independent and stress-induced behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants. Consequently, they support the view that the term ""behavioral sensitization"" may define different phenomena in which different, independent genotype-related factors play a major role. Finally, studies on the behavioral and central effects of stressful experiences in C57 and DBA mice together with psychopharmacogenetic analyses, indicate that different symptomatological profiles may derive from genotype-dependent adaptation of brain DA receptors to environmental pressure.","The cerebral stress response is examined following a variety of pathological conditions such as focal and global ischemia, administration of excitotoxins, and hyperthermia. Expression of 72 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) and hsp70 mRNA, the mechanism underlying induction of hsp70 mRNA involving activation of heat shock factor 1, and inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis are different aspects of the stress response considered here. The results are compared with those in the literature on induction, transcriptional regulation, expression, and cellular location of Hsp70, with a view to getting more insight into the function of the stress response in the injured brain. The present results illustrate that Hsp70 can be expressed in cells affected at various degrees following an insult that will either survive or dic as the brain lesion develops, depending on the severity of cell injury. This indicates that, under certain circumstances, synthesized Hsp70 might be necessary but not sufficient to ensure cell survival. Other situations involve uncoupling between synthesis of hsp70 mRNA and protein, probably due to very strict protein synthesis blockade, and often result in cell loss. Cells eventually will die if protein synthesis rates do not go back to normal after a period of protein synthesis inhibition. The stress response is a dynamic event that is switched on in neural cells sensitive to a brain insult. The stress response is, however, tricky, as affected cells seem to need it, have to deal transiently with it, but eventually be able to get rid of it, in order to survive. Putative therapeutic treatments can act either selectively, potentiating the synthesis of Hsp70 protein and recovery of protein synthesis, or preventing the stress response by deadening the insult severity.","Thalamocortical synapses inform the cerebral neocortex about the external and internal worlds. The thalamus produces myriad thalamocortical pathways that vary in morphological, physiological, pharmacological and functional properties. All these features are of great importance for understanding how information is acquired, integrated, processed, stored and retrieved by the thalamocortical system. This paper reviews the properties of the afferents from thalamus to cortex, and identifies some of the gaps in our knowledge of thalamocortical pathways.","Although endothelin (ET) was discovered as a potent vascular endothelium-derived constricting peptide, its presumed physiological and pathophysiological roles are now considered much more diverse than originally though. Endothelin in the brain is thought to be deeply involved in the central autonomic control and consequent cardiorespiratory homeostasis, possibly as a neuromodulator or a hormone that functions locally in an autocrine/paracrine manner or widely through delivery by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This notion is based on the following lines of evidence. (1) Mature ET, its precursors, converting enzymes, and receptors all are detected at strategic sites in the central nervous system (CNS), especially those controlling the autonomic functions. (2) The ET is present in the CSF at concentrations higher than in the plasma. (3) There is a topographical correspondence of ET and its receptors in the CNS. (4) The ET is released by primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. (5) When ET binds to its receptors, intracellular calcium channels. (6) An intracerebroventricular or topical application of ET to CNS sites elicits a pattern of cardiorespiratory changes accompanied by responses of vasomotor and respiratory neurons. (7) Recently generated knockout mice with disrupted genes encoding ET-1 exhibited, along with malformations in a subset of the tissues of neural crest cell lineage, cardiorespiratory abnormalities including elevation of arterial pressure, sympathetic overactivity, and impairment of the respiratory reflex. Definitive evidence is expected from thorough analyses of knockout mice by applying conventional experimental methods.","Diverse theories of animal navigation aim at explaining how to determine and maintain a course from one place to another in the environment, although each presents a particular perspective with its own terminologies. These vocabularies sometimes overlap, but unfortunately with different meanings. This paper attempts to define precisely the existing concepts and terminologies, so as to describe comprehensively the different theories and models within the same unifying framework. We present navigation strategies within a four-level hierarchical framework based upon levels of complexity of required processing (Guidance, Place recognition-triggered Response, Topological navigation, Metric navigation). This classification is based upon what information is perceived, represented and processed. It contrasts with common distinctions based upon the availability of certain sensors or cues and rather stresses the information structure and content of central processors. We then review computational models of animal navigation, i.e. of animats. These are introduced along with the underlying conceptual basis in biological data drawn from behavioral and physiological experiments, with emphasis on theories of ""spatial cognitive maps"". The goal is to aid in deriving algorithms based upon insights into these processes, algorithms that can be useful both for psychobiologists and roboticists. The main observation is, however, that despite the fact that all reviewed models claim to have biological inspiration and that some of them explicitly use ""Cognitive Map""-like mechanisms, they correspond to different levels of our proposed hierarchy and that none of them exhibits the main capabilities of real ""Cognitive Maps""--in Tolman's sense--that is, a robust capacity for detour and shortcut behaviors.","In this review, we compare the neural basis of olfactory learning in three specialized contexts that occur during sensitive periods of enhanced neural plasticity. Although they involve very different behavioural contexts, they share several common features, including a dependence on noradrenergic transmission in the olfactory bulb. The most extensively characterized of these examples is the learning of pheromonal information by female mice during mating. While this form of learning is unusual in that the neural changes underlying the memory occur in the accessory olfactory bulb at the first stage of sensory processing, it involves similar neural mechanisms to other forms of learning and synaptic plasticity. The learning of newborn lamb odours after parturition in sheep, and the olfactory conditioning in neonatal animals such as rats and rabbits, are mediated by the main olfactory system. Although the neural mechanisms for learning in the main olfactory system are more distributed, they also involve changes occurring in the olfactory bulb. In each case, odour learning induces substantial structural and functional changes, including increases in inhibitory neurotransmission. In the main olfactory bulb, this probably represents a sharpening of the odour-induced pattern of activity, due to increases in lateral inhibition. In contrast, the different morphology of mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb results in increased self-inhibition, disrupting the transmission of pheromonal information. Although these examples occur in highly specialized contexts, comparisons among them can enhance our understanding of the general neural mechanisms of olfactory learning.","In the brain, astrocytes are associated intimately with neurons and surround synapses. Due to their close proximity to synaptic clefts, astrocytes are in a prime location for receiving synaptic information from released neurotransmitters. Cultured astrocytes express a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, but do astrocytes in vivo also express neurotransmitter receptors and, if so, are the receptors activated by synaptically released neurotransmitters? In recent years, considerable efforts has gone into addressing these issues. The experimental results of this effort have been compiled and are presented in this review. Although there are many different receptors which have not been identified on astrocytes in situ, it is clear that astrocytes in situ express a number of different receptors. There is evidence of glutamatergic, GABAergic, adrenergic, purinergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and peptidergic receptors on protoplasmic, fibrous, or specialized (Bergmann glia, pituicytes, Müller glia) astrocytes in situ and in vivo. These receptors are functionally coupled to changes in membrane potential or to intracellular signaling pathways such as activation of phospholipase C or adenylate cyclase. The expression of neurotransmitter receptors by astrocytes in situ exhibits regional and intraregional heterogeneity and changes during development and in response to injury. There is also evidence that receptors on astrocytes in situ can be activated by neurotransmitter(s) released from synaptic terminals. Given the evidence of extra-synaptic signaling and the expression of neurotransmitter receptors by astrocytes in situ, direct communication between neurons and astrocytes via neurotransmitters could be a widespread form of communication in the brain which may affect many different aspects of brain function, such as glutamate uptake and the modulation of extracellular space.","The freely diffusible messenger nitric oxide (NO), generated by NO synthase (NOS)-containing ""nitroxergic"" (NO-ergic) neurons, is unique among classical synaptic chemical transmitters because of its ""non-specificity"", molecular ""NO-receptors"" (e.g. guanylyl cyclase, iron complexes, nitrosylated proteins or DNA) in target cells, intracellular targeting, regulated biosynthesis, and growth factor/cytokine-dependence. In the nervous system, expression of NOS is particularly intriguing in central and peripheral autonomic pathways and their targets. Here, anatomical and functional links appear to exist between NOS, its associated catalytic NADPH-diaphorase enzyme activity (NOSaD) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), a pleiotropic cytokine with mitogenic actions, suggesting mutual ""short- and long-term"" actions. Several recent studies performed in the rat sympathoadrenal system, an anatomically and neurochemically well-defined autonomic pathway with target-specific functional units of sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) in the spinal cord, provide evidence for this hypothesis. The NO and cytokine signals may interact at the level of gene expression, transcription factors, post-transcriptional control or second messenger cross-talk. Thus, unique biological roles of FGF-2 and the NO system are likely to exist in neuroendocrine actions, vasomotory perfusion control as well as in neurotrophic actions in sympathetic innervation of the adrenal gland. In view of their anatomical co-existence, functional interplay and synchronizing effects on neuronal networks, multiple roles are suggested for both ""short- and long-term"" signalling molecules in neuroendocrine functions and integrated autonomic target organ control.","Studies are reviewed, predominantly involving healthy humans, on gain changes in spinal reflexes and supraspinal ascending paths during passive and active leg movement. The passive movement research shows that the pathways of H reflexes of the leg and foot are down-regulated as a consequence of movement-elicited discharge from somatosensory receptors, likely muscle spindle primary endings, both ipsi- and contralaterally. Discharge from the conditioning receptors in extensor muscles of the knee and hip appears to lead to presynaptic inhibition evoked over a spinal path, and to long-lasting attenuation when movement stops. The ipsilateral modulation is similar in phase to that seen with active movement. The contralateral conditioning does not phase modulate with passive movement and modulates to the phase of active ipsilateral movement. There are also centrifugal effects onto these pathways during movement. The pathways of the cutaneous reflexes of the human leg also are gain-modulated during active movement. The review summarizes the effects across muscles, across nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimuli and over time elapsed after the stimulus. Some of the gain changes in such reflexes have been associated with central pattern generators. However, the centripetal effect of movement-induced proprioceptive drive awaits exploration in these pathways. Scalp-recorded evoked potentials from rapidly conducting pathways that ascend to the human somatosensory cortex from stimulation sites in the leg also are gain-attenuated in relation to passive movement-elicited discharge of the extensor muscle spindle primary endings. Centrifugal influences due to a requirement for accurate active movement can partially lift the attenuation on the ascending path, both during and before movement. We suggest that a significant role for muscle spindle discharge is to control the gain in Ia pathways from the legs, consequent or prior to their movement. This control can reduce the strength of synaptic input onto target neurons from these kinesthetic receptors, which are powerfully activated by the movement, perhaps to retain the opportunity for target neuron modulation from other control sources.","Rett syndrome (RS) is a progressive disorder that is predominant in females. It is associated with cortical atrophy, stereotyped hand movements mimicking hand-washing, severe mental deficiency, and cortical and extrapyramidal dysfunction. The cause of RS is unknown; no consistent genetic abnormalities, at either the cellular or mitochondrial levels, have been identified. The diagnosis still depends solely upon clinical evidence. The clinical progression of RS is consistent with an arrested neuronal development that may be due to either impaired cellular differentiation or the lack of appropriate trophic factors. Neuropathological studies have confirmed (1) a generalized brain atrophy involving the cerebrum and cerebellum; (2) a decrease in neuronal cell size and increased cell packing density throughout the brain; (3) a reduction in the number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons; (4) a reduction in the concentration of melanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. Biochemical studies have identified (1) a decrease in cholinergic markers in the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia; (2) inconsistent and variable changes in biogenic amine biomarkers in post-mortem tissues and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (3) an elevation of beta-endorphin levels in the thalamus and glutamate levels in the CSF; (4) no evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction. These data suggest that there is a primary deficit in cholinergic function that might underlie some of the higher cognitive impairments and extrapyramidal dysfunction. Overall, the clinical, biochemical and neuropathological data suggest that RS is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has its greatest effects upon a limited number of neural systems during the first few years of postnatal life.","During the last 20 years, mutual communications between the immune, the endocrine and the nervous systems have been defined on the basis of physiological, cellular, and molecular data. Nevertheless, a major problem in the new discipline ""Psychoneuroimmunology"" is that controversial data and differences in the interpretation of the results make it difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of the implications of immunoneuroendocrine interactions in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis, as well as in the initiation and the course of pathological conditions within these systems. In this article, we will first discuss the afferent pathways by which immune cells may affect CNS functions and, conversely, how neural tissues can influence the peripheral immune response. We will then review recent data, which emphasize the (patho)physiological roles of hippocampal-amygdala structures and the nucleus accumbens in neuroimmunomodulation. Neuronal activity within the hippocampal formation, the amygdaloid body, and the ventral parts of the basal ganglia has been examined most thoroughly in studies on neuroendocrine, autonomic and cognitive functions, or at the level of emotional and psychomotor behaviors. The interplay of these limbic structures with components of the immune system and vice versa, however, is still less defined. We will attempt to review and discuss this area of research taking into account recent evidences for neuroendocrine immunoregulation via limbic neuronal systems, as well as the influence of cytokines on synaptic transmission, neuronal growth and survival in these brain regions. Finally, the role of limbic structures in stress responses and conditioning of immune reactivity will be commented. Based on these data, we propose new directions of future research.","Neurophysiological evidence is described, showing that some neurons in the macaque temporal cortical visual areas have responses that are invariant with respect to the position, size and view of faces and objects, and that these neurons show rapid processing and rapid learning. A theory is then described of how such invariant representations may be produced in a hierarchically organized set of visual cortical areas with convergent connectivity. The theory proposes that neurons in these visual areas use a modified Hebb synaptic modification rule with a short-term memory trace to capture whatever can be captured at each stage that is invariant about objects as the object changes in retinal position, size, rotation and view. Simulations are then described which explore the operation of the architecture. The simulations show that such a processing system can build invariant representations of objects.","A concept that all hierarchical levels of the nervous system are built according to the same functional principles is proposed. Each level is responsible for a discrete type or set of automatisms, is a learning system, and contains two distinct functional subdivisions: (1) a controller, a subsystem providing a governing set of rules or commands-a control law-that directs the action of the recipient of these rules-the controlled object; and (2) a model, a subsystem that generates a model of object behavior, i.e. afferent information flow expected from the controlled object. A control system such as this receives two types of afferent signals-initiating and informational. The difference between these signals is that a control system minimizes initiating signals during the realization of an automatism, i.e. a control neural network utilizes informational signals to compute the proper output that minimizes the initiating input signal. A mismatch or error signal, a type of initiating signal, is responsible for learning. Both the control law and the model can be adjusted during learning. The learning process starts when the error signal increases and stops when it is minimized. A network hierarchy is structurally and functionally organized in such a way that a lower control system in the nervous system becomes the controlled object for a higher one. This hierarchy leads to a generalization of encoded functional parameters and, consequently, the working space for each higher level control system becomes more abstracted. This is the reason why each hierarchical level within the control nervous system uses detectors specific for feature of the controlled object and the environment that match the control needs in order to obtain information about the current state of the object in the environment. Movement of information toward higher hierarchical levels also is accompanied by an increase in the duration of initiating signals within each control system. The ability to store a long prehistory of preceding events is considered as the mechanism that necessitated the invention of more complex and more rapid forms of learning such as operant learning, and made possible more complex multistep computational algorithms that require memorization of the results of previous intermediate computations. The functions of the cerebellum, the limbic system and the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops are analyzed to illustrate the utility and applicability of this theoretical concept. Basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops are described as modeling, predictive loops, and their dopaminergic innervation as an error distribution system.","In addition to motor axons and preganglionic axons, ventral roots contain unmyelinated or thin myelinated sensory axons and postganglionic sympathetic axons. It has been said that ventral roots channel sensory axons to the CNS. However, it now seems that these axons end blindly, shift to the pia or loop and return towards the periphery and that these units reach the CNS via dorsal roots. Sensory ventral root axons project from a variety of somatic or visceral receptors; some of them are third branches of dorsal root afferents and some seem to lack a CNS projection. Many ventral root afferents contain substance P (SP) and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These fibres are not affected by neonatal capsaicin treatment and they cannot induce radicular or pial extravasation. Some thin ventral root axons are sympathetic and relate to blood vessels. Afferents containing SP and/or CGRP and sympathetic axons also occur in the spinal pia mater. The sensory axons mediate pain. They might also have vasomotor, tissue-regulatory and/or mechanoreceptive functions. The motor roots of cranial nerves IV, VI and XI contain unmyelinated axons arranged like in ventral roots outside the autonomic outflow. However, the motor root of cranial nerve V channels some unmyelinated axons into the CNS. The occurrence of thin axons in ventral roots and pia mater changes during development and ageing. After peripheral nerve injury, ipsilateral ventral roots and pia are invaded by new sensory and postganglionic sympathetic axons.","It is well established that nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signalling molecule in the nervous system of both mammals and insects. In contrast to classical transmitters, the membrane-permeant NO can act on neighbouring targets limited by half-life and diffusion barriers. This type of diffuse signalling seems to be evolutionarily highly conserved and recent findings concerning the characterization and function of the NO system in insects are summarized in this review. Firstly, the properties and the localization of the NO forming enzyme, the NO synthase (NOS), are described. In the nervous system the brain contains by far the highest NOS activity. As an evolutionary peculiarity, a blood-feeding bug exhibits high NOS activity in the salivary glands. Secondly, the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a major target of NO action, and cGMP-regulated enzymes like cGMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic nucleotide gated channels are described. Anatomical organization of the NO/cGMP system in insects reveals evidence for a cellular separation of the release site and target site of NO, although in the antennal lobes of the locust an exception from this rule exists. Thirdly, the implication of the NO system in neuronal function in insects is described. In the honeybee, the NO/cGMP system in the antennal lobes is implicated in the processing of adaptive mechanisms during chemosensory processing, and recent findings support a specific role of the NO system in memory formation. Discussion of the results in insects with regard to properties and functions of the vertebrate NO system is attempted.","gamma-Hydroxybutyrate is a metabolite of GABA which is synthesized and accumulated by neurons in brain. This substance is present in micromolar quantities in all brain regions investigated as well as in several peripheral organs. Neuronal depolarization releases gamma-hydroxybutyrate into the extracellular space in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate high-affinity receptors are present only in neurons, with a restricted specific distribution in the hippocampus, cortex and dopaminergic structures of rat brain (the striatum in general, olfactory bulbs and tubercles, frontal cortex, dopaminergic nuclei A9, A10 and A12). Stimulation of these receptors with low amounts of gamma-hydroxybutyrate induces in general hyperpolarizations in dopaminergic structures with a reduction of dopamine release. However, in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, it seems that gamma-hydroxybutyrate induces depolarization with an accumulation of cGMP and an increase in inositol phosphate turnover. Some of the electrophysiological effects of GHB are blocked by NCS-382, a gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptor antagonist while some others are strongly attenuated by GABAB receptors antagonists. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate penetrates freely into the brain when administered intravenously or intraperitoneally. This is a unique situation for a molecule with signalling properties in the brain. Thus, the gamma-hydroxybutyrate concentration in brain easily can be increased more than 100 times. Under these conditions, gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors are saturated and probably desensitized and down-regulated. It is unlikely that GABAB receptors could be stimulated directly by GHB. Most probably, GABA is released in part under the control of GHB receptors in specific pathways expressing GABAB receptors. Alternatively, GABAB receptors might be specifically stimulated by the GABA formed via the metabolism of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in brain. In animals and man, these GHBergic and GABAergic potentiations induce dopaminergic hyperactivity (which follows the first phase of dopaminergic terminal hyperpolarization), a strong sedation with anaesthesia and some EEG changes with epileptic spikes. It is presumed that, under pathological conditions (hepatic failure, alcoholic intoxication, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase defects), the rate of GHB synthesis or degradation in the peripheral organ is modified and induces increased GHB levels which could interfere with the normal brain mechanisms. This pathological status could benefit from treatments with gamma-hydroxybutyric and/or GABAB receptors antagonists. Nevertheless, the regulating properties of the endogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrate system on the dopaminergic pathways are a cause for the recent interest in synthetic ligands acting specifically at gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors and devoid of any role as metabolic precursor of GABA in brain.","The motor cortex plays a crucial role in the co-ordination of movement and posture. This is possible because the pyramidal tract fibres have access both directly and through collateral branches to structures governing eye, head, neck trunk and limb musculature. Pyramidal tract axons also directly reach the dorsal laminae of the spinal cord and the dorsal column nuclei, thus aiding in the selection of the sensory ascendant transmission. No other neurones in the brain besides pyramidal tract cells have such a wide access to different structures within the central nervous system. The majority of the pyramidal tract fibres that originate in the motor cortex and that send collateral branches to multiple supraspinal structures do not reach the spinal cord. Also, the great majority of the corticospinal neurones that emit multiple intracraneal collateral branches terminate at the cervical spinal cord level. The pyramidal tract fibres directed to the dorsal column nuclei that send collateral branches to supraspinal structures also show a clear tendency to terminate at supraspinal and cervical cord levels. These facts suggest that a substantial co-ordination between descending and ascending pathways might be produced by the same motor cortex axons at both supraspinal and cervical spinal cord sites. This may imply that the motor cortex co-ordination will be mostly directed to motor responses involving eye-neck-forelimb muscle synergies. The review makes special emphasis in the available evidence pointing to the role of the motor cortex in co-ordinating the activities of both descending and ascending pathways related to somatomotor integration and control. The motor cortex may function to co-operatively select a unique motor command by selectively filter sensory information and by co-ordinating the activities of the descending systems related to the control of distal and proximal muscles.","To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying behaviours in mammals, the respective contributions of the individual properties characterizing each neuron, as opposed to the properties emerging from the organization of these neurons in functional networks, have to be evaluated. This requires the use, in the same species, of various in vivo and in vitro experimental preparations. The present review is meant to illustrate how such a combined in vivo in vitro approach can be used to investigate the vestibular-related neuronal networks involved in gaze and posture stabilization, together with their plasticity, in the adult guinea-pig. Following first a general introduction on the vestibular system, the second section describes various in vivo experiments aimed at characterizing gaze and posture stabilization in that species. The third and fourth parts of the review deal with the combined in vivo-in vitro investigations undertaken to unravel the physiological and pharmacological properties of vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal networks, together with their functional implications. In particular, we have tried to use the central vestibular neurons as examples to illustrate how the preparation of isolated whole brain can be used to bridge the gap between the results obtained through in vitro, intracellular recordings on slices and those collected in vivo, in the behaving animal.","Primary cultures of postganglionic sympathetic neurons were established more than 30 years ago. More recently, these cultures have been used to characterize various neurotransmitter receptors that govern sympathetic transmitter release. These receptors may be categorized into at least three groups: (1) receptors which evoke transmitter release: (2) receptors which facilitate; (3) receptors which inhibit, depolarization-evoked release. Group (1) comprises nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, P2X purinoceptors and pyrimidinoceptors. Group (2) currently harbours beta-adrenoceptors, P2 purinoceptors, receptors for PACAP and VIP, as well as prostanoid EP1 receptors. In group (3), muscarinic cholinoceptors, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, P2 purinoceptors, and receptors for the neuropeptides NPY, somatostatin (SRIF1) and LHRH, as well as opioid (delta and kappa) receptors can be found. Receptors which regulate transmitter release from neurons in cell culture may be located either at the somatodendritic region or at the sites of exocytosis, i.e. the presynaptic specializations of axons. Most of the receptors that evoke release are located at the soma. There ionotropic receptors cause depolarizations to generate action potentials which then trigger Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis at axon terminals. The signalling mechanisms of metabotropic receptors which evoke release still remain to be identified. Receptors which facilitate depolarization-evoked release appear to be located preferentially at presynaptic sites and presumably act via an increase in cyclic AMP. Receptors which inhibit stimulation evoked release are also presynaptic origin and most commonly rely on a G protein-mediated blockade of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Results obtained with primary cell cultures of postganglionic sympathetic neurons have now supplemented previous data about neurotransmitter receptors involved in the regulation of ganglionic as well as sympatho-effector transmission. In the future, this technique may prove useful to identify yet unrecognized receptors which control the output of the sympathetic nervous system and to elucidate underlying signalling mechanisms.","This review is a critical appraisal of the widespread assumption that high extracellular glutamate, resulting from enhanced pre-synaptic release superimposed on deficient uptake and/or cytosolic efflux, is the key to excessive glutamate-mediated excitation in neurological disorders. Indeed, high extracellular glutamate levels do not consistently correlate with, nor necessarily produce, neuronal dysfunction and death in vivo. Furthermore, we exemplify with spreading depression that the sensitivity of an experimental or pathological event to glutamate receptor antagonists does not imply involvement of high extracellular glutamate levels in the genesis of this event. We propose an extension to the current, oversimplified concept of excitotoxicity associated with neurological disorders, to include alternative abnormalities of glutamatergic transmission which may contribute to the pathology, and lead to excitotoxic injury. These may include the following: (i) increased density of glutamate receptors; (ii) altered ionic selectivity of ionotropic glutamate receptors; (iii) abnormalities in their sensitivity and modulation; (iv) enhancement of glutamate-mediated synaptic efficacy (i.e. a pathological form of long-term potentiation); (v) phenomena such as spreading depression which require activation of glutamate receptors and can be detrimental to the survival of neurons. Such an extension would take into account the diversity of glutamate-receptor-mediated processes, match the complexity of neurological disorders pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and ultimately provide a more elaborate scientific basis for the development of innovative treatments.","Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a conventional mitogenic factor that stimulates the proliferation of various types of cells including epithelial cells and fibroblasts. EGF binds to and activates the EGF receptor (EGFR), which initiates intracellular signalling and subsequent effects. The EGFR is expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus in addition to other regions of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, EGF is also expressed in various regions of the CNS. Therefore, EGF acts not only on mitotic cells, but also on postmitotic neurons. In fact, many studies have indicated that EGF has neurotrophic or neuromodulatory effects on various types of neurons in the CNS. For example, EGF acts directly on cultured cerebral cortical and cerebellar neurons, enhancing neurite outgrowth and survival. On the other hand, EGF also acts on other cell types, including septal cholinergic and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, indirectly through glial cells. Evidence of the effects of EGF on neurons in the CNS is accumulating, but the mechanisms of action remain essentially unknown. EGF-induced signalling in mitotic cells is better understood than that in postmitotic neurons. Studies of cloned pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and cultured cerebral cortical neurons have suggested that the EGF-induced neurotrophic actions are mediated by sustained activation of the EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to EGF. The sustained intracellular signalling correlates with the decreased rate of EGFR down-regulation, which might determine the response of neuronal cells to EGF. It is likely that EGF is a multi-potent growth factor that acts upon various types of cells including mitotic cells and postmitotic neurons.","During the early development of the bird and the mammalian peripheral auditory system, a restricted range of low--mid frequencies is recorded in immature animals. These early recordings are correlated to the base or mid-basal region of the cochlea which codes high frequencies in the adult. In order to reconcile the functional observations with anatomical ones, two main hypotheses have been put forward: one called the development of the place principle derived from observations of acoustic trauma in chick cochlea and a second derived from auditory nerve fiber recordings in kittens. Whatever the theories, the tonotopic shift during development is a well-established phenomenon in both birds and mammals that could be explained by a synthetic theory including active and passive cochlear processes. The tonotopic shift observed in the central auditory system mimics quite closely the frequency representation of the peripheral auditory system. The same trend is observed in all auditory nuclei including the cortex, except that the frequency representation is more complex because it shows tonotopic maps that can be twisted in three dimensions. From current observations, there is a simultaneous onset of tonotopic maps across auditory nuclei up to the cortex. A hypothesis is presented related to the frequency changes observed in the cochlea that affect the central auditory pathway, along with possible consequences on auditory behavior."
