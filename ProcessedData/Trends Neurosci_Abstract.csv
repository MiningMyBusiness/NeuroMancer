"Developmental brain plasticity involves complex, time-dependent dynamic molecular interactions that cannot be observed directly in humans. We propose that the shared evolutionary homology of teeth and the neurosensory system, and the archival nature of dentine microstructure, allows the development of 'biologic hard drives' that can characterize perinatal temporal dynamics in neuroplasticity.","Fifteen years ago, an influential model proposed that the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) detects conflict and induces adaptive control of behavior. Over the years support for this model has been mixed, in particular due to divergent findings in human versus nonhuman primates. We here review recent findings that suggest greater commonalities across species. These include equivalent behavioral consequences of conflict and similar neuronal signals in the dACC, but also a common failure of dACC lesions to reliably abolish conflict-driven behavior. We conclude that conflict might be one among many drivers of adjustments in executive control and that the ACC might be just one component of overlapping distributed systems involved in context-dependent learning and behavioral control.","The acquisition and maintenance of the specific neuronal functions underlying learning, memory, and emotion require transduction of environmental stimuli into remodeling of neuronal circuitry. This process occurs via induction of plasticity-related transcriptional programs. The epigenetic enzyme lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), also known as lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A), and its neurospecific splicing variant neuroLSD1 have been implicated in this process through an antagonistic mechanism. Specifically, LSD1/neuroLSD1 are involved in the negative and positive regulation of activity-evoked transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) impacting memory formation and emotional behavior. Remarkably, the splicing process generating neuroLSD1 is homeostatically modulated by environmental contingencies, further implicating the LSD1/neuroLSD1 dual system as a modifier of information processing in the brain.","The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a combination of complex biochemical processes beginning with the initial insult and lasting for days, months and even years post-trauma. These changes range from neuronal integrity losses to neurotransmitter imbalance and metabolite dysregulation, leading to the release of pro- or anti-apoptotic factors which mediate cell survival or death. Such dynamic processes affecting the brain's neurochemistry can be monitored using a variety of neuroimaging techniques, whose combined use can be particularly useful for understanding patient-specific clinical trajectories. Here, we describe how TBI changes the metabolism of essential neurochemical compounds, summarize how neuroimaging approaches facilitate the study of such alterations, and highlight promising ways in which neuroimaging can be used to investigate post-TBI changes in neurometabolism.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized by the accumulation of α-synuclein within neurons. In contrast to the current ascending theory where α-synuclein would propagate from neuron to neuron, we now propose the threshold theory for PD based on evidence of parallel degeneration of both central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in PD. The functional threshold is lower for the emergence of early symptoms before the classical motor symptoms of PD. This is due to the larger functional reserve of the midbrain dopamine and integrated basal ganglia motor systems to control movement. This threshold theory better accounts for the current neurobiology of PD symptom progression compared to the hypothesis that the disease ascends from the PNS to the CNS as proposed by Braak's hypothesis.","Although the importance of network connectivity is increasingly recognized, identifying synapses remains challenging relative to the routine characterization of neuronal morphology. Thus, researchers frequently employ axon-dendrite colocations as proxies of potential connections. This putative equivalence, commonly referred to as Peters' rule, has been recently studied at multiple levels and scales, fueling passionate debates regarding its validity. Our critical literature review identifies three conceptually distinct but often confused applications: inferring neuron type circuitry, predicting synaptic contacts among individual cells, and estimating synapse numbers within neuron pairs. Paradoxically, at the originally proposed cell-type level, Peters' rule remains largely untested. Leveraging Hippocampome.org, we validate and refine the relationship between axonal-dendritic colocations and synaptic circuits, clarifying the interpretation of existing and forthcoming data.","The nervous systems of cnidarians, pre-bilaterian animals that diverged close to the base of the metazoan radiation, are structurally simple and thus have great potential to reveal fundamental principles of neural circuits. Unfortunately, cnidarians have thus far been relatively intractable to electrophysiological and genetic techniques and consequently have been largely passed over by neurobiologists. However, recent advances in molecular and imaging methods are fueling a renaissance of interest in and research into cnidarians nervous systems. Here, we review current knowledge on the nervous systems of cnidarian species and propose that researchers should seize this opportunity and undertake the study of members of this phylum as strategic experimental systems with great basic and translational relevance for neuroscience.","Neuronal adaptation - time-dependent modulation of sensory responses following sequential stimuli - is thought to be a consequence of synaptic plasticity. But recent, empirically-grounded, modeling by Quiroga and colleagues demonstrates that the adaptation of visual cortical responses can be described by recurrent network connections with fixed synaptic weights.","In rodents, the medial aspect of the secondary motor cortex (M2) is known by other names, including medial agranular cortex (AGm), medial precentral cortex (PrCm), and frontal orienting field (FOF). As a subdivision of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), M2 can be defined by a distinct set of afferent and efferent connections, microstimulation responses, and lesion outcomes. However, the behavioral role of M2 remains mysterious. Here, we focus on evidence from rodent studies, highlighting recent findings of early and context-dependent choice-related activity in M2 during voluntary behavior. Based on the current understanding, we suggest that a major function for M2 is to flexibly map antecedent signals such as sensory cues to motor actions, thereby enabling adaptive choice behavior.","Explaining the evolution of speech and language poses one of the biggest challenges in biology. We propose a dual network model that posits a volitional articulatory motor network (VAMN) originating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC; including Broca's area) that cognitively controls vocal output of a phylogenetically conserved primary vocal motor network (PVMN) situated in subcortical structures. By comparing the connections between these two systems in human and nonhuman primate brains, we identify crucial biological preadaptations in monkeys for the emergence of a language system in humans. This model of language evolution explains the exclusiveness of non-verbal communication sounds (e.g., cries) in infants with an immature PFC, as well as the observed emergence of non-linguistic vocalizations in adults after frontal lobe pathologies.","Tinnitus is a common disorder that often complicates hearing loss. Its mechanisms are incompletely understood. Current theories proposing pathophysiology from the ear to the cortex cannot individually - or collectively - explain the range of experimental evidence available. We propose a new framework, based on predictive coding, in which spontaneous activity in the subcortical auditory pathway constitutes a 'tinnitus precursor' which is normally ignored as imprecise evidence against the prevailing percept of 'silence'. Extant models feature as contributory mechanisms acting to increase either the intensity of the precursor or its precision. If precision (i.e., postsynaptic gain) rises sufficiently then tinnitus is perceived. Perpetuation arises through focused attention, which further increases the precision of the precursor, and resetting of the default prediction to expect tinnitus.",Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified associations between the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster and smoking heaviness and nicotine dependence. Studies in rodents have described the anatomical localisation and function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) formed by the subunits encoded by this gene cluster. Further investigations that complemented these studies highlighted the variability of individuals' smoking behaviours and their ability to adjust nicotine intake. GWASs of smoking-related health outcomes have also identified this signal in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster. This insight underpins approaches to strengthen causal inference in observational data. Combining genetic and mechanistic studies of nicotine dependence and smoking heaviness may reveal novel targets for medication development. Validated targets can inform genetic therapeutic interventions for smoking cessation and tobacco-related diseases.,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein that controls the patterning of neural progenitor cells, and their neuronal and glial progeny, during development. Emerging findings suggest that Shh also has important roles in the formation and plasticity of neuronal circuits in the hippocampus, a brain region of fundamental importance in learning and memory. Shh mediates activity-dependent and injury-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. Activation of Shh receptors in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons engages a trans-neuronal signaling pathway that accelerates axon outgrowth and enhances glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. Impaired Shh signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of several developmental and adult-onset neurological disorders that affect the hippocampus, suggesting a potential for therapeutic interventions that target Shh pathways.","Tissue injury can initiate bidirectional signaling between neurons, glia, and immune cells that creates and amplifies pain. While the ability for neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and cytokines to initiate and maintain pain has been extensively studied, recent work has identified a key role for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS; nitroxidative species), including superoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide. In this review we describe how nitroxidative species are generated after tissue injury and the mechanisms by which they enhance neuroexcitability in pain pathways. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for normalizing nitroxidative signaling, which may also enhance opioid analgesia, to help to alleviate the enormous burden of pathological pain.","The nervous system is viewed as a tissue affected by cancer and as a conduit for the transmission of cancer pain and perineural invasion. Here, we review recent studies that indicate a more direct role. Several studies have shown that reducing stress or suppressing sympathetic drive correlates with improved outcomes and prolonged survival. Recent studies using animal models of visceral and somatic cancer further support a role for the nervous system in cancer progression. Specifically, nerve ablation had a profound impact on disease progression, including delayed development of precancerous lesions, and decreased tumor growth and metastasis. In this review, we summarize new evidence and discuss how future studies may address the role of neural signaling in the modulation of tumorigenesis.",Altered inhibition from parvalbumin-containing GABA neurons is thought to contribute to impaired gamma frequency oscillations and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Crabtree and colleagues report that proline dehydrogenase deficits produce excessive cytosolic levels of the GABA-mimetic l-proline which impairs GABA synthesis and gamma oscillations in a manner that mimics schizophrenia.,"Currently, drug discovery focusses only on quantifying pharmacological parameters, sometimes including binding kinetics, of drug candidates. For a complete understanding of a drug's desired binding kinetics, the kinetics of both the target and its endogenous ligands should be considered. This is because the release and binding kinetics of endogenous ligands in addition to receptor internalization rates are significant contributors to drug-target interactions. Here, we discuss the kinetic profile of three neuropeptides and their receptors; gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), neuropeptide Y receptors, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1R). These three examples provide new insights into the importance of kinetic profiles which could improve the understanding of desired drug-target binding kinetics and advance drug discovery for various neurological and psychiatric illnesses.","Psychobiotics were previously defined as live bacteria (probiotics) which, when ingested, confer mental health benefits through interactions with commensal gut bacteria. We expand this definition to encompass prebiotics, which enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. We review probiotic and prebiotic effects on emotional, cognitive, systemic, and neural variables relevant to health and disease. We discuss gut-brain signalling mechanisms enabling psychobiotic effects, such as metabolite production. Overall, knowledge of how the microbiome responds to exogenous influence remains limited. We tabulate several important research questions and issues, exploration of which will generate both mechanistic insights and facilitate future psychobiotic development. We suggest the definition of psychobiotics be expanded beyond probiotics and prebiotics to include other means of influencing the microbiome.","In recent years, a new generation of animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on ectopic expression, overexpression, or intracerebral injection of the protein α-synuclein have emerged. Critically, these models develop inclusions of aggregated α-synuclein and/or α-synuclein-mediated neuronal loss replicating the defining pathological hallmarks of PD and driving significant advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underpinning PD. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of this new generation of animal models of PD, ranging from invertebrate to rodent to nonhuman primate. We focus on their strengths and limitations with respect to their highly anticipated contribution to the further understanding of α-synuclein pathobiology and the future testing of novel disease-modifying therapeutics.","The speed of neuronal information processing depends on neuronal firing frequency. Here, we describe the evolutionary advantages and ubiquitous occurrence of high-frequency firing within the mammalian nervous system in general. The highest firing frequencies so far have been observed at the cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell synapse. The mechanisms enabling high-frequency transmission at this synapse are reviewed and compared with other synapses. Finally, information coding of high-frequency signals at the mossy fiber synapse is discussed. The exceptionally high firing frequencies and amenability to high-resolution technical approaches both in vitro and in vivo establish the cerebellar mossy fiber synapse as an attractive model to investigate high-frequency signaling from the molecular up to the network level.","Cortical regions as early as primary visual cortex have been implicated in recognition memory. Here, we outline the challenges that this presents for neurobiological accounts of recognition memory. We conclude that understanding the role of early visual cortex (EVC) in this process will require the use of protocols that mask stimuli from visual awareness.","d-Serine modulates N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and regulates synaptic plasticity, neurodevelopment, and learning and memory. However, the primary site of d-serine synthesis and release remains controversial, with some arguing that it is a gliotransmitter and others defining it as a neuronal cotransmitter. Results from several laboratories using different strategies now show that the biosynthetic enzyme of d-serine, serine racemase (SR), is expressed almost entirely by neurons, with few astrocytes appearing to contain d-serine. Cell-selective suppression of SR expression demonstrates that neuronal, rather than astrocytic d-serine, modulates synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose an alternative conceptualization whereby astrocytes affect d-serine levels by synthesizing l-serine that shuttles to neurons to fuel the neuronal synthesis of d-serine.","A daily rhythm that is not in synchrony with the environmental light-dark cycle (as in jetlag and shift work) is known to affect mood and health through an as yet unresolved neural mechanism. Here, we combine Bayesian probabilistic 'cue-conflict' theory with known physiology of the biological clock of the brain, entailing the insight that, for a functional pacemaker, it is sufficient to have two interacting units (reflecting environmental and internal time-of-day cues), without the need for an extra homuncular directing unit. Unnatural light-dark cycles cause a time-of-day cue-conflict that is reflected by a desynchronization between the ventral (environmental) and dorsal (internal) pacemaking signals of the pacemaker. We argue that this desynchronization, in-and-of-itself, produces health issues that we designate as 'circadian-time sickness', analogous to 'motion sickness'.","Progress in cognitive neuroscience relies on methodological developments to increase the specificity of knowledge obtained regarding brain function. For example, in functional neuroimaging the current trend is to study the type of information carried by brain regions rather than simply compare activation levels induced by task manipulations. In this context noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS) in the study of cognitive functions may appear coarse and old fashioned in its conventional uses. However, in their multitude of parameters, and by coupling them with behavioral manipulations, NTBS protocols can reach the specificity of imaging techniques. Here we review the different paradigms that have aimed to accomplish this in both basic science and clinical settings and follow the general philosophy of information-based approaches.","'Emotional intelligence' (EI) is one of the most highly used psychological terms in popular nomenclature, yet its construct, divergent, and predictive validities are contentiously debated. Despite this debate, the EI construct is composed of a set of emotional abilities - recognizing emotional states in the self and others, using emotions to guide thought and behavior, understanding how emotions shape behavior, and emotion regulation - that undoubtedly influence important social and personal outcomes. In this review, evidence from human lesion studies is reviewed in order to provide insight into the necessary brain regions for each of these core emotional abilities. Critically, we consider how this neuropsychological evidence might help to guide efforts to define and measure EI.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2016.08.006 PMID: 27637566  [PubMed - in process],"Neurons in the brain are highly plastic, allowing an organism to learn and adapt to its environment. However, this ongoing plasticity is also inherently unstable, potentially leading to aberrant levels of circuit activity. Homeostatic forms of plasticity are thought to provide a means of controlling neuronal activity by avoiding extremes and allowing network stability. Recent work has shown that many of these homeostatic modifications change the structure of subcellular neuronal compartments, ranging from changes to synaptic inputs at both excitatory and inhibitory compartments to modulation of neuronal output through changes at the axon initial segment (AIS) and presynaptic terminals. Here we review these different forms of structural plasticity in neurons and the effects they may have on network function.","In the past few years, proline-rich transmembrane protein (PRRT)2 has been identified as the causative gene for several paroxysmal neurological disorders. Recently, an important role of PRRT2 in synapse development and function has emerged. Knock down of the protein strongly impairs the formation of synaptic contacts and neurotransmitter release. At the nerve terminal, PRRT2 endows synaptic vesicle exocytosis with Ca(2+) sensitivity by interacting with proteins of the fusion complex and with the Ca(2+) sensors synaptotagmins (Syts). In the postsynaptic compartment, PRRT2 interacts with glutamate receptors. The study of PRRT2 and of its mutations may help in refining our knowledge of the process of synaptic transmission and elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to derangement of network function in paroxysmal disorders.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2016.08.008 PMCID: PMC5048592 [Available on 2017-10-01] PMID: 27623195  [PubMed - in process],"Neuroscientists are increasingly using advanced neuroimaging methods to elucidate the intergenerational transmission of human brain circuitry. This new line of work promises to shed light on the ontogeny of complex behavioral traits, including psychiatric disorders, and possible mechanisms of transmission. Here we highlight recent intergenerational neuroimaging studies and provide recommendations for future work.","Behavioral evidence from phylogenetically diverse animals and from humans suggests that, by extracting temporal information inherent in the olfactory signal, olfaction is more involved in interpreting space and time than heretofore imagined. If this is the case, the olfactory system must have neural mechanisms capable of encoding time at intervals relevant to the turbulent odor world in which many animals live. Here, we review evidence that animals can use populations of rhythmically active or 'bursting' olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs) to extract and encode temporal information inherent in natural olfactory signals. We postulate that bORNs represent an unsuspected neural mechanism through which time can be accurately measured, and that 'smelling time' completes the requirements for true olfactory scene analysis.","The thalamus is the major source of cortical inputs shaping sensation, action, and cognition. Thalamic circuits are targeted by two major inhibitory systems: the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and extrathalamic inhibitory (ETI) inputs. A unifying framework of how these systems operate is currently lacking. Here, we propose that TRN circuits are specialized to exert thalamic control at different spatiotemporal scales. Local inhibition of thalamic spike rates prevails during attentional selection, whereas global inhibition more likely prevails during sleep. In contrast, the ETI (arising from basal ganglia, zona incerta (ZI), anterior pretectum, and pontine reticular formation) provides temporally precise and focal inhibition, impacting spike timing. Together, these inhibitory systems allow graded control of thalamic output, enabling thalamocortical operations to dynamically match ongoing behavioral demands.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2016.07.004 PMID: 27503637  [PubMed - in process],"Alzheimer disease (AD) research has mainly focused on neurodegenerative processes associated with the classic neuropathologic markers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Additionally, cerebrovascular contributions to dementia are increasingly recognized, particularly from cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Remarkably, in AD brains, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ɛ4 allele shows male excess for cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), a marker of SVD, which is opposite to the female excess of plaques and tangles. Mouse transgenic models add further complexities to sex-ApoE ɛ4 allele interactions, with female excess of both CMBs and brain amyloid. We conclude that brain aging and AD pathogenesis cannot be understood in humans without addressing major gaps in the extent of sex differences in cerebrovascular pathology.","Impaired social functioning is pervasive in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, existing treatments have limited efficacy, and possible psychological or neurobiological mechanisms underlying social dysfunction in this disorder remain obscure. Here, we evaluate whether social preference, one key aspect of social processing that has been largely overlooked in schizophrenia research, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction can provide insights into the mechanism underlying social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Based on evidence from developmental psychology, and behavioral and clinical neuroscience, we propose a heuristic model in which reduced NMDAR function may induce disrupted social preference that can subsequently lead to social cognitive impairment and social disability. We discuss its implications in terms of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, other disorders with marked social disability, and potential treatments.","The cortical actin network is a tight array of filaments located beneath the plasma membrane. In neurosecretory cells, secretory vesicles are recruited on this network via a small insert isoform of myosin VI in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Upon secretagogue stimulation, myosin II mediates a relaxation of the actin network leading to synchronous translocation of bound or caged vesicles to the plasma membrane where they undergo exocytosis. F-actin is also recruited to secretory sites, where structural changes are detected immediately preceding and following exocytic events. Here we examine the mechanism underpinning the astonishing multifunctionality of this network in the various stages of vesicular exocytosis and compensatory bulk endocytosis. We propose a theoretical framework incorporating critical roles of the actin network in coupling these processes.","The many interactions between the nervous and the immune systems, which are active in both physiological and pathological states, have recently become more clearly delineated with the discovery of a meningeal lymphatic system capable of carrying fluid, immune cells, and macromolecules from the central nervous system (CNS) to the draining deep cervical lymph nodes. However, the exact localization of the meningeal lymphatic vasculature and the path of drainage from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the lymphatics remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the potential differences between peripheral and CNS lymphatic vessels and examine the purported mechanisms of CNS lymphatic drainage, along with how these may fit into established patterns of CSF flow.","Recent research has highlighted the importance of the two-way interaction between the nervous and immune systems. This interaction is particularly important in the bowel because of the unique properties of this organ. The lumen of the gut is lined by a very large but remarkably thin surface that separates the body from the enteric microbiome. Immune defenses against microbial invasion are thus well developed and neuroimmune interactions are important in regulating and integrating these defenses. Important concepts in the phylogeny of neuroimmunity, enteric neuronal and glial regulation of immunity, changes that occur in the enteric nervous system during inflammation, the fundamental role of serotonin (5-HT) in enteric neuroimmune mechanisms, and future perspectives are reviewed.","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNAs with a covalently closed loop structure that have recently regained the attention of biologists. Using deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, genome-wide studies have detected a large number of circRNAs, many of which are abundant, stable, and well conserved during evolution. With few exceptions, the function of most circRNAs remains elusive. Several recent studies have shown that circRNAs are more enriched in neuronal tissues and are often derived from genes specific for neuronal and synaptic function. Moreover, circRNA expression is regulated during neuronal development and by synaptic plasticity, suggesting specific neuronal functions. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the detection, biogenesis, and potential functions of circRNAs, with a particular focus on brain tissues.","Although the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas have been intensely investigated in relation to their motor functions, they are also consistently reported in studies of auditory processing and auditory imagery. This involvement is commonly overlooked, in contrast to lateral premotor and inferior prefrontal areas. We argue here for the engagement of supplementary motor areas across a variety of sound categories, including speech, vocalizations, and music, and we discuss how our understanding of auditory processes in these regions relate to findings and hypotheses from the motor literature. We suggest that supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas play a role in facilitating spontaneous motor responses to sound, and in supporting a flexible engagement of sensorimotor processes to enable imagery and to guide auditory perception.","All hippocampal and neocortical networks can be driven to seize quite easily. This can be done using drugs, by altering the ionic constituency of the bathing medium [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)], or by electrical stimulation (both experimentally and clinically, as in electroconvulsive therapy). It is worth asking why this is so, because this will both tell us more about potentially devastating neurological disorders and extend our understanding of cortical function and architecture. Here I review work examining the features of cortical networks that bias activity towards and away from hyperexcitability. I suggest that several cellular- and circuit-level features of rapidly responsive interneuron networks tip the balance away from seizure in the healthy brain.","Humans are adept at performing an extraordinary breadth of voluntary motor actions that allow us to rapidly move around and interact with the environment. While voluntary motor actions necessarily include top-down intention to generate a motor act, a key to voluntary control is the selective use of bottom-up sensory feedback to select and guide motor actions. This review classifies the many ways in which sensory feedback is used by the motor system and highlights regularities in the timing of each class of motor responses to sensory stimuli, revealing a functional hierarchical organization of motor control. The highly automatic way in which feedback is typically used in goal-directed action blurs the distinction between reflexes and voluntary control.","Although it is far too early to say that cognitive neuroscience will have any direct impact on how we sentence criminals, patterns are nevertheless emerging that suggest a neural framework for punishment that could one day have important legal and social consequences.","Sleep disruption appears to be a core component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its pathophysiology. Signature abnormalities of sleep emerge before clinical onset of AD. Moreover, insufficient sleep facilitates accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), potentially triggering earlier cognitive decline and conversion to AD. Building on such findings, this review has four goals: evaluating (i) associations and plausible mechanisms linking non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep disruption, Aβ, and AD; (ii) a role for NREM sleep disruption as a novel factor linking cortical Aβ to impaired hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation; (iii) the potential diagnostic utility of NREM sleep disruption as a new biomarker of AD; and (iv) the possibility of sleep as a new treatment target in aging, affording preventative and therapeutic benefits.","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) continuously flows through the cerebral ventricles, a process essential for brain homeostasis. Multiciliated ependymal (E1) cells line the walls of the ventricles and contribute importantly to CSF flow through ciliary beating. Key to this function is the rotational and translational planar cell polarity (PCP) of E1 cells. Defects in the PCP of E1 cells can result in abnormal CSF accumulation and hydrocephalus. Here, we integrate recent data on the roles of early CSF flow in the embryonic ventricles, PCP regulators (e.g., Vangl2 and Dishevelled), and cytoskeletal networks in the establishment, refinement, and maintenance of E1 cells' PCP. The planar organization mechanisms of E1 cells could explain how CSF flow contributes to brain function and may help in the diagnosis and prevention of hydrocephalus.","Multisensory processes are fundamental in scaffolding perception, cognition, learning, and behavior. How and when stimuli from different sensory modalities are integrated rather than treated as separate entities is poorly understood. We review how the relative reliance on stimulus characteristics versus learned associations dynamically shapes multisensory processes. We illustrate the dynamism in multisensory function across two timescales: one long term that operates across the lifespan and one short term that operates during the learning of new multisensory relations. In addition, we highlight the importance of task contingencies. We conclude that these highly dynamic multisensory processes, based on the relative weighting of stimulus characteristics and learned associations, provide both stability and flexibility to brain functions over a wide range of temporal scales.","The slip hypothesis of epicritic tactile perception interprets actively moving sensor and touched objects as a frictional system, known to lead to jerky relative movements called 'slips'. These slips depend on object geometry, forces, material properties, and environmental factors, and, thus, have the power to incorporate coding of the perceptual target, as well as perceptual strategies (sensor movement). Tactile information as transferred by slips will be encoded discontinuously in space and time, because slips sometimes engage only parts of the touching surfaces and appear as discrete and rare events in time. This discontinuity may have forced tactile systems of vibrissae and fingertips to evolve special ways to convert touch signals to a tactile percept.","During hearing, acoustic signals travel up the ascending auditory pathway from the cochlea to auditory cortex; efferent connections provide descending feedback. In human listeners, although auditory and cognitive processing have sometimes been viewed as separate domains, a growing body of work suggests they are intimately coupled. Here, we review the effects of hearing loss on neural systems supporting spoken language comprehension, beginning with age-related physiological decline. We suggest that listeners recruit domain general executive systems to maintain successful communication when the auditory signal is degraded, but that this compensatory processing has behavioral consequences: even relatively mild levels of hearing loss can lead to cascading cognitive effects that impact perception, comprehension, and memory, leading to increased listening effort during speech comprehension.","Navigation of the growth cone at the tip of the developing axon is crucial for the proper wiring of the nervous system. Mechanisms of actin-dependent growth cone steering, via signaling cascades, are well documented. Microtubules are also important in growth cone guidance, because their polarized invasion into the peripheral domain on one side of the growth cone is essential for it to turn in that direction. Classically, microtubules have been considered secondary players, invading the peripheral domain only where the actin cytoskeleton permits them to go. Presented here is evidence for an underappreciated mechanism by which signaling cascades can potentially affect growth cone turning, namely through regulatable forces imposed on the microtubules by molecular motor proteins.","Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of mental illnesses including schizophrenia and affective disorders, yet the neurodevelopmental processes underlying this vulnerability remain poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its local GABAergic system are thought to contribute to the core of cognitive deficits associated with such disorders. However, clinical and preclinical end-point analyses performed in adults are likely to give limited insight into the cellular mechanisms that are altered during adolescence but are only manifested in adulthood. This perspective summarizes work regarding the developmental trajectories of the GABAergic system in the PFC during adolescence to provide an insight into the increased susceptibility to psychiatric disorders during this critical developmental period.","Despite the enormous societal burden of alcohol and drug addiction and abundant research describing drug-induced maladaptive synaptic plasticity, there are few effective strategies for treating substance use disorders. Recent awareness that synaptic plasticity involves astroglia and the extracellular matrix is revealing new possibilities for understanding and treating addiction. We first review constitutive corticostriatal adaptations that are elicited by and shared between all abused drugs from the perspective of tetrapartite synapses, and integrate recent discoveries regarding cell type-specificity in striatal neurons. Next, we describe recent discoveries that drug-seeking is associated with transient synaptic plasticity that requires all four synaptic elements and is shared across drug classes. Finally, we prognosticate how considering tetrapartite synapses can provide new treatment strategies for addiction.","Innate immunity has evolved as the front-line cellular defense mechanism to acutely sense and decisively respond to microenvironmental alterations. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family activates signaling pathways in response to stimuli and is well-characterized in both resident and infiltrating immune cells during neural inflammation, injury, and degeneration. Innate immune signaling has also been observed in neural cells during development and disease, including in the stem and progenitor cells that build the brain and are responsible for its homeostasis. Recently, the activation of developmental programs in malignant brain tumors has emerged as a driver for growth via cancer stem cells. In this review we discuss how innate immune signaling interfaces with stem cell maintenance in the normal and neoplastic brain.","Loss of inhibitory control over appetitively motivated behavior occurs in multiple psychiatric disorders, including drug abuse, behavioral addictions, and eating disorders with binge features. In this opinion article, novel actions of μ-opioid peptides in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that could contribute to inhibitory control deficits will be discussed. Evidence has accrued to suggest that excessive intra-PFC μ-opioid receptor (μ-OR) signaling alters the PFC response to excitatory drive, resulting in supernormal and incoherent recruitment of multiple PFC output pathways. Affected pathways include functionally opposed PFC→hypothalamus 'appetitive driver' and PFC→striatum 'appetitive limiter' projections. This network perturbation engenders disorganized, impulsive appetitive responses. Evidence supporting this hypothesis from human imaging and animal studies will be discussed, and combinatorial drug treatments targeting μ-ORs and specific PFC subcortical targets will be explored.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2016.04.006 PMID: 27131472  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher],"Foraging-associated predation risk is a natural problem all prey must face. Fear evolved due to its protective functions, guiding and shaping behaviors that help animals adapt to various ecological challenges. Despite the breadth of risky situations in nature that demand diversity in fear behaviors, contemporary neurobiological models of fear stem largely from Pavlovian fear conditioning studies that focus on how a particular cue becomes capable of eliciting learned fear responses, thus oversimplifying the brain's fear system. Here we review fear from functional, mechanistic, and phylogenetic perspectives where environmental threats cause animals to alter their foraging strategies in terms of spatial and temporal navigation, and discuss whether the inferences we draw from fear conditioning studies operate in the natural world.","The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic signaling pathway triggered by protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Beyond its protective role, it plays important functions during normal development in response to elevated demand for protein folding. Several UPR effectors show dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns that correlate with milestones of the central nervous system (CNS) development. Here, we discuss recent studies suggesting that a dynamic regulation of UPR supports generation, maturation, and maintenance of differentiated neurons in the CNS. We further highlight studies supporting a developmental vulnerability of CNS to UPR dysregulation, which underlies neurodevelopmental disorders. We believe that a better understanding of UPR functions may provide novel opportunities for therapeutic strategies to fight ER/UPR-associated human neurological disorders.","Impairments in memory and cognitive function are characteristic symptoms of stress-related disorders, but the relationship between stress and memory is complex. Recent findings suggest that hippocampal inflammatory processes contribute to spatial memory deficits in the rodent social defeat model that can be reversed by anti-inflammatory treatment with minocycline.","Despite an appreciation of the importance of myelination and the consequences of pathological demyelination, the fundamental mechanisms regulating myelination are only now being resolved. Neuronal activity has long been considered a plausible regulatory signal for myelination. However, controversy surrounding its dispensability in certain contexts and the difficulty in determining to what degree it influences myelination has limited its widespread acceptance. Recent studies have shed new light on the role of neuronal activity in regulating oligodendrogenesis and myelination. Further, the dynamics of myelin in adulthood and the association between skilled learning and myelination have become increasingly well characterized. These advances present new considerations for the management of multiple sclerosis and open up new approaches to facilitate remyelination following pathological demyelination.","A master brain clock, localized to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), coordinates daily rhythms of physiology and behavior. Within the SCN, interconnected individual neurons are oscillators that, as an ensemble, function to send a coherent timing signal to the brain and body. However, individually, these neurons display different amplitudes, periods, and phases of oscillation. The dynamic properties of the SCN have been characterized over several spatial levels of analysis, from proteins to cells to tissues, and over several temporal ranges, from milliseconds to weeks. Modeling tools guide empirical research in this complex and multiscale spatiotemporal environment. Given that the SCN is a prototypical example of oscillating neural systems, principles of its organization hold promise as general prototypes of rhythms in other frequencies.","The colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase regulates tissue macrophage homeostasis, osteoclastogenesis, and Paneth cell development. However, recent studies in mice have revealed that CSF-1R signaling directly controls the development and maintenance of microglia, and cell autonomously regulates neuronal differentiation and survival. While the CSF-1R-cognate ligands, CSF-1 and interleukin-34 (IL-34) compete for binding to the CSF-1R, they are expressed in a largely non-overlapping manner by mature neurons. The recent identification of a dominantly inherited, adult-onset, progressive dementia associated with inactivating mutations in the CSF-1R highlights the importance of CSF-1R signaling in the brain. We review the roles of the CSF-1R and its ligands in microglial and neural development and function, and their relevance to our understanding of neurodegenerative disease.",Genetically encoded optical sensors of cell activity are powerful tools that can be targeted to specific cell types. This is especially important in neuroscience because individual brain regions can include a multitude of different cell types. Optical imaging allows for simultaneous recording from numerous neurons or brain regions. Optical signals of membrane potential are useful because membrane potential changes are a direct sign of both synaptic and action potentials. Here we describe recent improvements in the in vitro and in vivo signal size and kinetics of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) and discuss their relationship to alternative sensors of neural activity.,"To achieve greatest efficacy, therapies for attenuating fear and anxiety should preclude the re-emergence of emotional responses. Of relevance to this aim, preclinical models of threat memory reduction are considered to engage one of two discrete neural processes: either establishment of a new behavioral response that competes with, and thereby temporarily interferes with the expression of, threat memory (new learning) or one that modifies and thereby disrupts threat memory (unlearning). We contend that a strict dichotomy of new learning and unlearning does not provide a compelling explanation for current data. Instead, we suggest that the evidence warrants consideration of alternative models that assume cooperation rather than competition between formation of new cellular traces and the modification of preexisting ones.","Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is an important pathoanatomical subgroup of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major driver of mortality and functional impairment. Experimental models have provided insights into the effects of mechanical deformation on the neuronal cytoskeleton and the subsequent processes that drive axonal injury. There is also increasing recognition that axonal or white matter loss may progress for years post-injury and represent one mechanistic framework for progressive neurodegeneration after TBI. Previous trials of novel therapies have failed to make an impact on clinical outcome, in both TBI in general and TAI in particular. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of injury have the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets.","Several lines of evidence suggest that proliferation and differentiation in neural stem cells (NSCs) are a major convergence point of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Most genes with truncating mutations are implicated in NSC proliferation and differentiation (e.g., MBD5, CDKL5, and MECP2). Similarly, reciprocal deletion/duplication copy-number variants (CNVs), such as 1q21.1 and 16p11.2, are inversely correlated with head size. In addition, pathways such as MAPK, mTOR, and RAS, which are important in cancer, a disease of uncontrolled cell proliferation, are implicated in NDDs. These deficits are a measurable output of patient-derived induced neural progenitor cells, and may represent a diagnostic tool and a possible clinical intervention point for molecular therapies, irrespective of genotype.","Prevention of progression in neurological diseases, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS) but also in neurodegenerative diseases, remains a significant challenge. MS patients switch from a relapsing-remitting to a progressive disease course, but it is not understood why and how this conversion occurs and why some patients never experience disease progression. Do aging and accumulation of neuronal damage induce progression, or do cognitive symptoms and accelerated grey matter (GM) atrophy point to distinct processes affecting networks? This review weighs accepted dogma against real data on the secondary progressive phase of the disease, highlighting current challenges in this important field and directions towards development of treatment strategies to slow or prevent progression of disability.","Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are rapidly activated after sensory and behavioral experience and are believed to be crucial for converting experience into long-term memory. Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4), a recently discovered IEG, has several characteristics that make it likely to be a particularly important molecular link between neuronal activity and memory: it is among the most rapidly induced IEGs, is expressed only in neurons, and is selectively induced by neuronal activity. By orchestrating distinct activity-dependent gene programs in different neuronal populations, Npas4 affects synaptic connections in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, neural circuit plasticity, and memory formation. It may also be involved in circuit homeostasis through negative feedback and psychiatric disorders. We summarize these findings and discuss their implications.","The maintenance of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization is essential for proper cellular function. Recent studies from the Gage and the Hipp labs report impairments in transport across the nuclear envelope in models of normal and pathological neuronal senescence, providing a mechanistic link between cerebral aging and neurodegenerative diseases.","The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is involved in the degradation of long-lived proteins. Deficits in the ALP result in protein aggregation, the generation of toxic protein species, and accumulation of dysfunctional organelles, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and prion disease. Decades of research have therefore focused on enhancing the ALP in neurodegenerative diseases. More recently, transcription factor EB (TFEB), a major regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, has emerged as a leading factor in addressing disease pathology. We review the regulation of the ALP and TFEB and their impact on neurodegenerative diseases. We also offer our perspective on the complex role of autophagy and TFEB in disease pathogenesis and its therapeutic implications through the examination of prion disease.","The evolutionary acquisition of myelin sheaths around large caliber axons in the central nervous system (CNS) represented a milestone in the development of vertebrate higher brain function. Myelin ensheathment of axons enabled saltatory conduction and thus accelerated information processing. However, a number of CNS diseases harm or destroy myelin and oligodendrocytes (myelin-producing cells), ultimately resulting in demyelination. In the adult CNS, new oligodendrocytes can be generated from a quiescent pool of precursor cells, which - upon differentiation - can replace lost myelin sheaths. The efficiency of this spontaneous regeneration is limited, which leads to incomplete remyelination and residual clinical symptoms. Here, we discuss CNS pathologies characterized by white matter degeneration and regeneration and highlight drugs that could potentially serve as remyelination therapies.","Concentration gradients are believed to play a key role in guiding axons to their appropriate targets during neural development. However, there are fundamental physical constraints on gradient detection, and these strongly limit the fidelity with which axons can respond to gradient cues. I discuss these constraints and argue they suggest that many axon guidance events in vivo cannot be explained solely in terms of gradient-based mechanisms. Rather, precise wiring requires the collaboration of gradients with other types of guidance cues. Since we know relatively little about how this might work, I argue that our understanding of how the brain becomes wired up during development is still at an early stage.","How perception of pain emerges from neural activity is largely unknown. Identifying a neural 'pain signature' and deriving a way to predict perceived pain from brain activity would have enormous basic and clinical implications. Researchers are increasingly turning to functional brain imaging, often applying machine-learning algorithms to infer that pain perception occurred. Yet, such sophisticated analyses are fraught with interpretive difficulties. Here, we highlight some common and troublesome problems in the literature, and suggest methods to ensure researchers draw accurate conclusions from their results. Since functional brain imaging is increasingly finding practical applications with real-world consequences, it is critical to interpret brain scans accurately, because decisions based on neural data will only be as good as the science behind them.","Many signaling pathways participate in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal degeneration. While calpains participate in these phenomena, very few studies have evaluated the respective roles of the two major calpain isoforms in the brain, calpain-1 and calpain-2. We review recent studies indicating that calpain-1 and calpain-2 exhibit opposite functions in both synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Calpain-1 activation is required for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and is generally neuroprotective, while calpain-2 activation limits the extent of potentiation and is neurodegenerative. This duality of functions is related to their associations with different PDZ-binding proteins, resulting in differential subcellular localization, and offers new therapeutic opportunities for a number of indications in which these proteases have previously been implicated.","Since the early 1990s it has been postulated that hypofunction of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in brain networks supporting perception and cognition underlies schizophrenic psychosis. Recently, NMDA receptor hypofunction was described in patients with psychotic manifestations who exhibited autoantibodies binding the GluN1 subunit of the receptor, and who improved when the level of these antibodies was lowered by immunomodulation. In this disorder, NMDA receptor antibodies decrease the availability of NMDA receptors by internalizing them. In this opinion article, we review this mechanism as well as data supporting or refuting the possibility that this disorder or similar autoimmune disorders affecting synaptic proteins, which are therefore treatable with immunomodulation, could account for some cases of idiopathic psychosis. We also suggest methodological approaches to clarify this issue.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with associated frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) are major neurodegenerative diseases for which there are no cures. All are characterised by damage to several seemingly disparate cellular processes. The broad nature of this damage makes understanding pathogenic mechanisms and devising new treatments difficult. Can the different damaged functions be linked together in a common disease pathway and which damaged function should be targeted for therapy? Many functions damaged in neurodegenerative diseases are regulated by communications that mitochondria make with a specialised region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; mitochondria-associated ER membranes or 'MAM'). Moreover, several recent studies have shown that disturbances to ER-mitochondria contacts occur in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review these findings.","Action potentials invading the presynaptic terminal trigger discharge of docked synaptic vesicles (SVs) by opening voltage-dependent calcium channels (CaVs) and admitting calcium ions (Ca(2+)), which diffuse to, and activate, SV sensors. At most synapses, SV sensors and CaVs are sufficiently close that release is gated by individual CaV Ca(2+) nanodomains centered on the channel mouth. Other synapses gate SV release with extensive Ca(2+) microdomains summed from many, more distant CaVs. We review the experimental preparations, theories, and methods that provided principles of release nanophysiology and highlight expansion of the field into synaptic diversity and modifications of release gating for specific synaptic demands. Specializations in domain gating may adapt the terminal for roles in development, transmission of rapid impulse frequencies, and modulation of synaptic strength.","Chronic pain is a major medical problem that is resistant to conventional medical intervention. It also causes emotional changes such as anxiety and fear. Furthermore, anxiety or fear often enhances the suffering of pain. Based on recent studies, I propose chronic anxiety triggered by injury or chronic pain is mediated through presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key cortical region for pain perception. Conversely, NMDA receptor-dependent postsynaptic LTP plays a more important role in behavioral sensitization in chronic pain. Thus, postsynaptic and presynaptic LTP in ACC neurons are likely the key cellular mechanisms for causing chronic pain and its associated anxiety, respectively. This suggests potential targets for treating chronic pain and related anxiety.","Understanding the mechanisms for communication in the brain remains one of the most challenging scientific questions. The communication through coherence (CTC) hypothesis was originally proposed 10 years ago, stating that two groups of neurons communicate most effectively when their excitability fluctuations are coordinated in time (i.e., coherent), and this control by cortical coherence is a fundamental brain mechanism for large-scale, distant communication. In light of new evidence from whole-brain computational modelling of multimodal neuroimaging data, we link CTC to the concept of metastability, which refers to a rich exploration of the functional repertoire made possible by the underlying structural whole-brain connectivity.","At excitatory and inhibitory synapses, an immediate transfer of additional neurotransmitter receptors from non-synaptic positions to the synapse mediates synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). Different types of non-synaptic reserve pools permit the rapid supply of transmembrane neurotransmitter receptors. Recycling endosomes (REs) serve as an intracellular reservoir of receptors that is delivered to the plasma membrane on LTP induction. Furthermore, AMPA receptors at the non-synaptic plasma membrane provide an extrasynaptic reserve pool that is also important to potentiate synapse function. Finally, bidirectional synaptic versus extrasynaptic trapping of freely diffusing plasma membrane GABAA receptors (GABAARs) by scaffolding proteins modulates synaptic transmission. Here we discuss novel findings regarding neurotransmitter receptor reservoirs and potential reserve pool mechanisms for synaptic potentiation.","The protease β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chronic inhibition of this protease may temper amyloid production and cure or prevent AD. However, while BACE1 inhibitors are being pushed forward as drug candidates, a remarkable gap in knowledge on the physiological functions of BACE1 and its close homolog BACE2 becomes apparent. Here we discuss the major discoveries of the past 3 years concerning BACE1 biology and to what extent these could limit the use of BACE1 inhibitors in the clinic.","Lying at the intersection between neurobiology and epigenetics, Rett syndrome (RTT) has garnered intense interest in recent years, not only from a broad range of academic scientists, but also from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to the critical need for treatments for this devastating disorder, optimism for developing RTT treatments derives from a unique convergence of factors, including a known monogenic cause, reversibility of symptoms in preclinical models, a strong clinical research infrastructure highlighted by an NIH-funded natural history study and well-established clinics with significant patient populations. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the biology of RTT, particularly promising preclinical findings, lessons from past clinical trials, and critical elements of trial design for rare disorders.","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common psychiatric disorders, is characterised by unstable response patterns across multiple cognitive domains. However, the neural mechanisms that explain these characteristic features remain unclear. Using a computational multilevel approach, we propose that ADHD is caused by impaired gain modulation in systems that generate this phenotypic increased behavioural variability. Using Marr's three levels of analysis as a heuristic framework, we focus on this variable behaviour, detail how it can be explained algorithmically, and how it might be implemented at a neural level through catecholamine influences on corticostriatal loops. This computational, multilevel, approach to ADHD provides a framework for bridging gaps between descriptions of neuronal activity and behaviour, and provides testable predictions about impaired mechanisms.","Neuronal oscillations at nearby sites in the brain often show phase relations that are consistent across time, yet diverse across space. We discuss recent demonstrations of this phase relation diversity, and show that, contrary to earlier beliefs, this diversity is a general property of oscillations that is neither restricted to low-frequency oscillations nor to periods outside of stimulus processing. Arguing for the computational relevance of phase relation diversity, we discuss that it can be modulated by sensory and motor events, and put forward the idea that phase relation diversity may support effective neuronal communication by (i) enhancing selectivity and (ii) allowing for the concurrent segregation of multiple information streams.",Comment on Elife. 2015;4. pii: e11352. doi: 10.7554/eLife.11352.,"Crossmodal integration is a term applicable to many phenomena in which one sensory modality influences task performance or perception in another sensory modality. We distinguish the term binding as one that should be reserved specifically for the process that underpins perceptual object formation. To unambiguously differentiate binding form other types of integration, behavioral and neural studies must investigate perception of a feature orthogonal to the features that link the auditory and visual stimuli. We argue that supporting true perceptual binding (as opposed to other processes such as decision-making) is one role for cross-sensory influences in early sensory cortex. These early multisensory interactions may therefore form a physiological substrate for the bottom-up grouping of auditory and visual stimuli into auditory-visual (AV) objects.","There is accumulating evidence from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies that the acquisition of motor skills involves both perceptual and motor learning. Perceptual learning alters movements, motor learning, and motor networks of the brain. Motor learning changes perceptual function and the sensory circuits of the brain. Here, we review studies of both human limb movement and speech that indicate that plasticity in sensory and motor systems is reciprocally linked. Taken together, this points to an approach to motor learning in which perceptual learning and sensory plasticity have a fundamental role.","The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans stops feeding and moving during a larval transition stage called lethargus and following exposure to cellular stressors. These behaviors have been termed 'sleep-like states'. We argue that these behaviors should instead be called sleep. Sleep during lethargus is similar to sleep regulated by circadian timers in insects and mammals, and sleep in response to cellular stress is similar to sleep induced by sickness in other animals. Sleep in mammals and Drosophila shows molecular and functional conservation with C. elegans sleep. The simple neuroanatomy and powerful genetic tools of C. elegans have yielded insights into sleep regulation and hold great promise for future research into sleep regulation and function.",Comment on Nature. 2015 Oct 29;526(7575):705-9.,"Brain oscillations are one of the core mechanisms underlying episodic memory. However, while some studies highlight the role of synchronized oscillatory activity, others highlight the role of desynchronized activity. We here describe a framework to resolve this conundrum and integrate these two opposing oscillatory behaviors. Specifically, we argue that the synchronization and desynchronization reflect a division of labor between a hippocampal and a neocortical system, respectively. We describe a novel oscillatory framework that integrates synchronization and desynchronization mechanisms to explain how the two systems interact in the service of episodic memory.","Presynaptic NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) play pivotal roles in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. They facilitate presynaptic neurotransmitter release and modulate mechanisms controlling synaptic maturation and plasticity during formative periods of brain development. There is an increasing understanding of the roles of preNMDARs in experience-dependent synaptic and circuit-specific computation. In this review we summarize the latest understanding of compartment-specific expression and function of preNMDARs, and how they contribute to synapse-specific and circuit-level information processing.",Comment on Cell Rep. 2015 Nov 3;13(5):1003-15.,Comment on Science. 2015 Oct 30;350(6260):550-4.,"Human choice behaviors during social interactions often deviate from the predictions of game theory. This might arise partly from the limitations in the cognitive abilities necessary for recursive reasoning about the behaviors of others. In addition, during iterative social interactions, choices might change dynamically as knowledge about the intentions of others and estimates for choice outcomes are incrementally updated via reinforcement learning. Some of the brain circuits utilized during social decision making might be general-purpose and contribute to isomorphic individual and social decision making. By contrast, regions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporal parietal junction (TPJ) might be recruited for cognitive processes unique to social decision making.","The serotonin and neurotrophic factor hypotheses of depression are well known. The discovery of brain fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-5 hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT1A) heteroreceptor complexes, and their enhancement of neuroplasticity, offers an integration of these hypotheses at the molecular level. They were first described in the hippocampus and later in midbrain 5-HT neurons, where these heterocomplexes are enriched in 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Combined FGF2 and 5-HT1A agonist treatment increased the formation of these heterocomplexes and the facilitatory allosteric receptor-receptor interactions within them led to the enhancement of FGFR1 signaling and was associated with the development of antidepressant effects. We discuss these findings with regard to a theory of motifs critically involved in these interactions and suggest that these complexes represent novel targets for antidepressants.","Much has been learned about the hippocampal/entorhinal system, but an overview of how its parts work in an integrated way is lacking. One question regards the function of entorhinal grid cells. We propose here that their fundamental function is to provide a coordinate system for producing mind-travel in the hippocampus, a process that accesses associations with upcoming positions. We further propose that mind-travel occurs during the second half of each theta cycle. By contrast, the first half of each theta cycle is devoted to computing current position using sensory information from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and path integration information from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). This model explains why MEC lesions can abolish hippocampal phase precession but not place fields.","There is extensive evidence that aging is associated with impairments in episodic memory. Many of these changes have been ascribed to neurobiological alterations to the hippocampal network and its input pathways. A cross-species consensus is beginning to emerge suggesting that subtle synaptic and functional changes within this network may underlie the majority of age-related memory impairments. In this review we survey convergent data from animal and human studies that have contributed significantly to our understanding of the brain-behavior relationships in this network, particularly in the aging brain. We utilize a cognitive as well as a neurobiological perspective and synthesize data across approaches and species to reach a more detailed understanding of age-related alterations in hippocampal memory function.","Generalized epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures caused by oscillatory neuronal firing throughout thalamocortical networks. Current therapeutic approaches often intervene at the level of the thalamus or cerebral cortex to ameliorate seizures. We review here the therapeutic potential of cerebellar stimulation. The cerebellum forms a prominent ascending input to the thalamus and, whereas stimulation of the foliated cerebellar cortex exerts inconsistent results, stimulation of the centrally located cerebellar nuclei (CN) reliably stops generalized seizures in experimental models. Stimulation of this area indicates that the period of stimulation with respect to the phase of the oscillations in thalamocortical networks can optimize its effect, opening up the possibility of developing on-demand deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments.","Sleep is not a single state, but a complex set of brain processes that supports several physiological needs. Sleep deprivation is known to affect attention in many animals, suggesting that a key function of sleep is to regulate attention. Conversely, tasks that require more attention drive sleep need and sleep intensity. Attention involves the ability to filter incoming stimuli based on their relative salience, and this is likely to require coordinated synaptic activity across the brain. This capacity may have only become possible with the evolution of related neural mechanisms that support two key sleep functions: stimulus suppression and synaptic plasticity. We argue here that sleep and attention may have coevolved as brain states that regulate each other.","Homeosis is classically defined as the transformation of one body part into something that resembles another body part. We propose here to broaden the concept of homeosis to the many neuronal cell identity transformations that have been uncovered over the past few years upon removal of specific regulatory factors in organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice. The concept of homeosis provides a framework for the evolution of cell type diversity in the brain.", ,"Neural oscillations are ubiquitously observed in the mammalian brain, but it has proven difficult to tie oscillatory patterns to specific cognitive operations. Notably, the coupling between neural oscillations at different timescales has recently received much attention, both from experimentalists and theoreticians. We review the mechanisms underlying various forms of this cross-frequency coupling. We show that different types of neural oscillators and cross-frequency interactions yield distinct signatures in neural dynamics. Finally, we associate these mechanisms with several putative functions of cross-frequency coupling, including neural representations of multiple environmental items, communication over distant areas, internal clocking of neural processes, and modulation of neural processing based on temporal predictions.","Erroneous activation of the pain-sensing system, as in chronic or neuropathic pain, represents a major health burden with insufficient treatment options. However, the study of genetic disorders rendering individuals completely unable to feel pain offers hope. All causes of congenital painlessness affect nociceptors, evolutionarily conserved specialist neurons able to sense all type of tissue damage. The discovery of new genes essential for sensing pain (SCN11A, PRDM12, and CLTCL1) has provided unexpected insights into the biological mechanisms that drive distinct stages of nociception. Drugs targeting two previously discovered painlessness genes, NGF and SCN9A, are currently in late-stage clinical trials; thus, characterization of these new painlessness genes has significant potential for the generation of new classes of analgesics.","Accumulating evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a role in aging and lifespan determination. In this review, we critically discuss age-related changes in NPY levels in the brain, together with recent findings concerning the contribution of NPY to, and impact on, six hallmarks of aging, specifically: loss of proteostasis, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, deregulated nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding how NPY contributes to, and counteracts, these hallmarks of aging will open new avenues of research on limiting damage related to aging.","Attention networks comprise brain areas whose coordinated activity implements stimulus selection. This selection is reflected in spatially referenced priority maps across frontal-parietal-collicular areas and is controlled through interactions with circuits representing behavioral goals, including prefrontal, cingulate, and striatal circuits, among others. We review how these goal-providing structures control stimulus selection through long-range dynamic projection motifs. These motifs (i) combine feature-tuned subnetworks to a distributed priority map, (ii) establish endogenously controlled, long-range coherent activity at 4-10 Hz theta and 12-30 Hz beta-band frequencies, and (iii) are composed of unique cell types implementing long-range networks through disynaptic disinhibition, dendritic gating, and feedforward inhibitory gain control. This evidence reveals common circuit motifs used to coordinate attentionally selected information across multi-node brain networks during goal-directed behavior.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. Pathognomonic accumulation of cerebral β-amyloid plaques likely results from imbalanced production and removal of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. In AD, innate immune cells lose their ability to restrict cerebral Aβ accumulation. At least in principle, mononuclear phagocytes can be enlisted to clear Aβ/β-amyloid from the brain. While the classical focus has been on dampening neuroinflammation in the context of AD, we hypothesize that rebalancing cerebral innate immunity by inhibiting actions of key anti-inflammatory cytokines returns the brain to a physiological state. Recent experiments demonstrating beneficial effects of blocking anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling in preclinical mouse models provide supportive evidence. This concept represents an important step toward innate immune-targeted therapy to combat AD.",Comment on J Neurosci. 2015 Jul 15;35(28):10290-303.,How should evolution and development build the brain to be capable of flexible and generative cognition? I wish to put forth a 'power-of-two'-based wiring logic that provides the basic computational principle in organizing the microarchitecture of cell assemblies that would readily enable knowledge and adaptive behaviors to emerge upon learning.,"Several recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in patients with neurodegenerative disorders have shed new light on the brain immune system, suggesting that it plays a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Mononuclear phagocytes are blatantly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) of the central nervous system (CNS), but the specific functions of resident microglia, perivascular or meningeal macrophages, and circulating myeloid cells have not yet been fully resolved. Next-generation sequencing, high-throughput immune profiling technologies, and novel genetic tools have recently revolutionized the characterization of innate immune responses during AD. These studies advocate selective and non-redundant roles for myeloid subsets, which could be a target for novel disease-modifying therapies in AD.","Despite decades of intensive research, the biological mechanisms that causally underlie depression are still unclear, and therefore the development of novel effective antidepressant treatments is hindered. Recent studies indicate that impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia, caused by either intense inflammatory activation (e.g., following infections, trauma, stroke, short-term stress, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases) or by decline and senescence of these cells (e.g., during aging, Alzheimer's disease, or chronic unpredictable stress exposure), can lead to depression and associated impairments in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Accordingly, some forms of depression can be considered as a microglial disease (microgliopathy), which should be treated by a personalized medical approach using microglial inhibitors or stimulators depending on the microglial status of the depressed patient.","Studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have predominantly focused on two major pathologies: amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau. These misfolded proteins can accumulate asymptomatically in distinct regions over decades. However, significant Aβ accumulation can be seen in individuals who do not develop dementia, and tau pathology limited to the transentorhinal cortex, which can appear early in adulthood, is usually clinically silent. Thus, an interaction between these pathologies appears to be necessary to initiate and propel disease forward to widespread circuits. Recent multidisciplinary findings strongly suggest that the third factor required for disease progression is an aberrant microglial immune response. This response may initially be beneficial; however, a maladaptive microglial response eventually develops, fueling a feed-forward spread of tau and Aβ pathology.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to secondary neuropsychiatric problems that develop and persist years after injury. Mounting evidence indicates that neuroinflammatory processes progress after the initial head injury and worsen with time. Microglia contribute to this inflammation by maintaining a primed profile long after the acute effects of the injury have dissipated. This may set the stage for glial dysfunction and hyperactivity to challenges including subsequent head injury, stress, or induction of a peripheral immune response. This review discusses the evidence that microglia become primed following TBI and how this corresponds with vulnerability to a 'second hit' and subsequent neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative complications.","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains the optimal microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) for proper brain function. The BBB comprises specialized CNS endothelial cells with fundamental molecular properties essential for the function and integrity of the BBB. The restrictive nature of the BBB hinders the delivery of therapeutics for many neurological disorders. In addition, recent evidence shows that BBB dysfunction can precede or hasten the progression of several neurological diseases. Despite the physiological significance of the BBB in health and disease, major discoveries of the molecular regulators of BBB formation and function have occurred only recently. This review highlights recent findings describing the molecular determinants and core cellular pathways that confer BBB properties on CNS endothelial cells.","Sleep benefits the consolidation of psychological memory, and there are hints that sleep likewise supports immunological memory formation. Comparing psychological and immunological domains, we make the case for active system consolidation that is similarly established in both domains and partly conveyed by the same sleep-associated processes. In the psychological domain, neuronal reactivation of declarative memory during slow-wave sleep (SWS) promotes the redistribution of representations initially stored in hippocampal circuitry to extra-hippocampal circuitry for long-term storage. In the immunological domain, SWS seems to favor the redistribution of antigenic memories initially held by antigen-presenting cells, to persisting T cells serving as a long-term store. Because storage capacities are limited in both systems, system consolidation presumably reduces information by abstracting 'gist' for long-term storage.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2015.08.007 PMID: 26442692  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2015.08.005 PMID: 26442691  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Cognitive flexibility, the readiness with which one can selectively switch between mental processes to generate appropriate behavioral responses, develops in a protracted manner and is compromised in several prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. It is unclear whether cognitive flexibility arises from neural substrates distinct from the executive control network (ECN) or from the interplay of nodes within this and other networks. Here we review neuroimaging studies of cognitive flexibility, focusing on set shifting and task switching. We propose that more consistent operationalization and study of cognitive flexibility is required in clinical and developmental neuroscience. We suggest that an important avenue for future research is the characterization of the relationship between neural flexibility and cognitive flexibility in typical and atypical development.","In the neocortex, different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons connect to one another following a detailed blueprint, defining functionally-distinct subnetworks, whose activity and modulation underlie complex cognitive functions. We review the cell-autonomous plasticity of perisomatic inhibition onto principal excitatory neurons. We propose that the tendency of different cortical layers to exhibit depression or potentiation of perisomatic inhibition is dictated by the specific identities of principal neurons (PNs). These are mainly defined by their projection targets and by their preference to be innervated by specific perisomatic-targeting basket cell types. Therefore, principal neurons responsible for relaying information to subcortical nuclei are differentially inhibited and show specific forms of plasticity compared to other PNs that are specialized in more associative functions.","Astrocytes have emerged as important partners of neurons in information processing. Important progress has been made in the past two decades in understanding the role of astrocytes in the generation of neuron-astrocyte network outputs resulting in behavior. We review evidence for astrocyte involvement across four different behavioral domains: cognition, emotion, motor, and sensory processing. Accumulating evidence from animal models has provided a wealth of data that largely supports a direct involvement of astrocytes on diverse aspects of behavior. The development of tools for selectively controlling the temporal and spatial properties of astrocyte activity will help to consolidate our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this involvement.","Most neurons are generated during development and are not replaced during adulthood, even if they are lost to injury or disease. However, it is firmly established that new neurons are generated in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of almost all adult mammals, including humans. Nevertheless, many questions remain regarding adult neurogenesis in other brain regions and particularly in humans, where standard birth-dating methods are not generally feasible. Exciting recent evidence indicates that calretinin-expressing interneurons are added to the adult human striatum at a substantial rate. The role of new neurons is unknown, but studies in rodents will be able to further elucidate their identity and origin and then we may begin to understand their regulation and function.","The consolidation of memories for places and events is thought to rely, at the network level, on the replay of spatially tuned neuronal firing patterns representing discrete places and spatial trajectories. This occurs in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit during sharp wave ripple events (SWRs) that occur during sleep or rest. Here, we review theoretical models of lingering place cell excitability and behaviorally induced synaptic plasticity within cell assemblies to explain which sequences or places are replayed. We further provide new insights into how fluctuations in cholinergic tone during different behavioral states might shape the direction of replay and how dopaminergic release in response to novelty or reward can modulate which cell assemblies are replayed.","An understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of fear is essential for the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders, such as phobias, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Orexins, also known as hypocretins, are neuropeptides located exclusively in hypothalamic neurons that have extensive projections throughout the central nervous system. Although this system was initially believed to be primarily involved in the regulation of feeding behavior, recent studies have shown that orexins also modulate neural circuits implicated in the expression and extinction of fear memories. Here, we discuss recent findings involving orexins in anxiety disorders and current clinical trials using orexin ligands that could be applied to identify new therapies for diseases characterized by pathological fear.","A fundamental physical interaction exists across the synapse. It is mediated by synaptic adhesion molecules, and is among the earliest and most indispensable of molecular events occurring during synaptogenesis. The regulation of adhesion molecules and their interactions with other synaptic proteins likely affect not only on synapse formation but also on ongoing synaptic function. We review research on one major family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, neuroligins, which bind to their presynaptic partner neurexin across the synaptic cleft. We move from a structural overview to the broad cellular and synaptic context of neuroligins, intermolecular interactions, and molecular modifications that occur within a synapse. Finally, we examine evidence concerning the physiological functions of neuroligin in a cell and highlight areas requiring further investigation.","A common feature of the mammalian striate cortex is the arrangement of 'orientation domains' containing neurons preferring similar stimulus orientations. They are arranged as spokes of a pinwheel that converge at singularities known as 'pinwheel centers'. We propose that a cortical network of feedforward and intracortical lateral connections elaborates a full set of optimum orientations from geniculate inputs that show a bias to stimulus orientation and form a set of two or a small number of 'Cartesian' coordinates. Because each geniculate afferent carries signals only from one eye and its receptive field (RF) is either ON or OFF center, the network constructs also ocular dominance columns and a quasi-segregation of ON and OFF responses across the horizontal extent of the striate cortex.","Communication is a central theme in biology. Consequently, specialized structures have evolved to permit rapid communication among cells, tissues, organs, and physiological systems, thus enhancing the overall function and adaptation of the organism. A prime example is the neuronal synapse. In the brain, synaptic communication establishes neuronal networks with the capacity to integrate, process, and store information, giving rise to complex output signals capable of orchestrating functions across the organism. At the intracellular level, discoveries now reveal the existence of 'mitochondrial synapses' establishing mitochondrial networks, with defined chromatin-modifying mitochondrial output signals capable of orchestrating gene expression across the genome. These discoveries raise the possibility that in addition to their role as powerhouses and neuromodulators, mitochondria behave as intracellular signal-processing networks.",Comment on J Neurosci. 2015 May 20;35(20):7866-77.,Comment on Neuron. 2015 Mar 18;85(6):1319-31.,"The past two decades have witnessed a rise in the 'NMDA receptor hypofunction' hypothesis for schizophrenia, a devastating disorder that affects around 1% of the population worldwide. A variety of presynaptic, postsynaptic, and regulatory proteins involved in glutamatergic signaling have thus been proposed as potential therapeutic targets. This review focuses on positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate 2 receptors (mGlu2Rs) and discusses how recent preclinical epigenetic data may provide a molecular explanation for the discrepant results of clinical studies, further stimulating the field to exploit the promise of mGlu2R as a target for schizophrenia treatment.","The claustrum is a mysterious thin sheet of neurons lying between the insular cortex and the striatum. It is reciprocally connected with almost all cortical areas, including motor, somatosensory, visual, auditory, limbic, associative, and prefrontal cortices. In addition, it receives neuromodulatory input from subcortical structures. A decade ago, Sir Francis Crick and Christof Koch published an influential review proposing the claustrum as the 'seat of consciousness', spurring a revival of interest in the claustrum. We review the literature on the claustrum, emphasizing recent discoveries, and develop a detailed hypothesis describing a role for the claustrum in the segregation of attention.","As studies increasingly use transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) to manipulate brain activity, surprising results are emerging. Specifically, research combining tDCS with electrophysiology is showing that the long-lasting effects of tDCS can counter-intuitively influence specific neural mechanisms active for as little as 100 ms during the flow of human information processing.","Dendrites play a central role in the integration and flow of information in the nervous system. The morphogenesis and maturation of dendrites is hence an essential step in the establishment of neuronal connectivity. Recent studies have uncovered crucial functions for extrinsic cues in the development of dendrites. We review the contribution of secreted polypeptide growth factors, contact-mediated proteins, and neuronal activity in distinct phases of dendrite development. We also highlight how extrinsic cues influence local and global intracellular mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis. Finally, we discuss how these studies have advanced our understanding of neuronal connectivity and have shed light on the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.","'Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability' (E.W. Dijkstra [1]) Presynaptic action potentials trigger the fusion of vesicles to release neurotransmitter onto postsynaptic neurons. Each release site was originally thought to liberate at most one vesicle per action potential in a probabilistic fashion, rendering synaptic transmission unreliable. However, the simultaneous release of several vesicles, or multivesicular release (MVR), represents a simple mechanism to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of synaptic transmission. MVR was initially identified at specialized synapses but is now known to be common throughout the brain. MVR determines the temporal and spatial dispersion of transmitter, controls the extent of receptor activation, and contributes to adapting synaptic strength during plasticity and neuromodulation. MVR consequently represents a widespread mechanism that extends the dynamic range of synaptic processing.","A century after the discovery of acetylcholine (ACh), we recognize both ACh receptors, transporters, and synthesizing and degrading enzymes and regulators of their expression as contributors to cognition, metabolism, and immunity. Recent discoveries indicate that pre- and post-transcriptional ACh signaling controllers coordinate the identity, functioning, dynamics, and brain-to-body communication of cholinergic cells. Checks and balances including epigenetic mechanisms, alternative splicing, and miRNAs may all expand or limit the diversity of these cholinergic components by consistently performing genome-related surveillance. This regulatory network enables homeostatic maintenance of brain-to-body ACh signaling as well as reactions to nicotine, Alzheimer's disease anticholinesterase therapeutics, and agricultural pesticides. Here I review recent reports on the functional implications of these controllers of cholinergic signaling in and out of the brain.","Coding principles are central to understanding the organization of brain circuitry. Sparse coding offers several advantages, but a near-consensus has developed that it only has beneficial properties, and these are partially unique to sparse coding. We find that these advantages come at the cost of several trade-offs, with the lower capacity for generalization being especially problematic, and the value of sparse coding as a measure and its experimental support are both questionable. Furthermore, silent synapses and inhibitory interneurons can permit learning speed and memory capacity that was previously ascribed to sparse coding only. Combining these properties without exaggerated sparse coding improves the capacity for generalization and facilitates learning of models of a complex and high-dimensional reality.","Estradiol (E2) can act in the brain in a relatively fast manner (i.e., seconds to minutes) usually through signaling initiated at the cell membrane. Brain-derived E2 has thus been considered as another type of neurotransmitter. Recent work found that behaviors indicative of male sexual motivation are activated by estrogenic metabolites of testosterone (T) in a fast manner, while sexual performance (copulatory behavior per se) is regulated by brain E2 in a slower manner via nucleus-initiated actions. This functional division between these two types of action appears to generalize to other behavioral systems regulated by E2. We propose the dual action of estrogen hypothesis to explain this functional distinction between these two different modes of action.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2015 Jul;38(7):401-2. Trends Neurosci. 2014 Jun;37(6):304-14.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2015 Jul;38(7):403-4.,"Definitions of learning vary widely across disciplines, driven largely by different approaches used to assess its occurrence. These definitions can be better reconciled with each other if each is recognized as coherent with a common conceptualization of learning, while appreciating the practical utility of different learning definitions in different contexts.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2015.04.009 PMID: 26008121  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Memory reconsolidation is a protein synthesis-dependent process that preserves, in some form, memories that have been destabilized through recall. Reconsolidation is a nearly universal phenomenon, occurring in a diverse array of species and learning tasks. The function of reconsolidation remains unclear but it has been proposed as a mechanism for updating or strengthening memories. Observations of an analog of reconsolidation in vitro and in sensory systems indicate that reconsolidation is unlikely to be a learning-specific phenomenon and may serve a broader function. We propose that reconsolidation arises from the activity-dependent induction of two coincident but opposing processes: the depotentiation and repotentiation of strengthened synapses. These processes suggest that reconsolidation reflects a fundamental mechanism that regulates and preserves synaptic strength.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2014 Nov;37(11):620-8.,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament (IF) III protein uniquely found in astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), non-myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and enteric glial cells. GFAP mRNA expression is regulated by several nuclear-receptor hormones, growth factors, and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). GFAP is also subject to numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs), while GFAP mutations result in protein deposits known as Rosenthal fibers in Alexander disease. GFAP gene activation and protein induction appear to play a critical role in astroglial cell activation (astrogliosis) following CNS injuries and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence also suggests that, following traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries and stroke, GFAP and its breakdown products are rapidly released into biofluids, making them strong candidate biomarkers for such neurological disorders.","The selectivity of optogenetics commonly relies on genetic promoters to manipulate specific populations of neurons through the use of Cre-driver lines. All studies performed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) so far have utilized promoters present in groups of cells that release dopamine (DA), GABA, or glutamate. However, neurons that co-release neurotransmitters and variabilities within groups of neurons that release the same neurotransmitter present challenges when evaluating the results. Further complexity is introduced by ectopic expression patterns often occurring in transgenic Cre-drivers. New perspectives could be unfolded by identifying and selecting different types of promoter for driving the Cre recombinase. Here, we discuss some promising candidates and highlight the advantages or disadvantages of different methods for creating novel transgenic lines.","Balancing behaviors that provide a reward NOW versus behaviors that provide an advantage LATER is critical for survival. We propose a model in which dopamine (DA) can favor NOW processes through phasic signaling in reward circuits or LATER processes through tonic signaling in control circuits. At the same time, through its modulation of the orbitofrontal cortex, which processes salience attribution, DA also enables shifting from NOW to LATER, while its modulation of the insula, which processes interoceptive information, influences the probability of selecting NOW vs LATER actions on the basis of an individual's physiological state. Disruptions along these circuits contribute to diverse pathologies, including obesity and addiction.","Although interest in the neurobiology of parent-infant bonding is a century old, neuroimaging of the human parental brain is recent. After summarizing current comparative research into the neurobiology of parenting, here I chart a global 'parental caregiving' network that integrates conserved structures supporting mammalian caregiving with later-evolving networks and implicates parenting in the evolution of higher order social functions aimed at maximizing infant survival. The response of the parental brain to bonding-related behavior and hormones, particularly oxytocin, and increased postpartum brain plasticity demonstrate adaptation to infant stimuli, childrearing experiences, and cultural contexts. Mechanisms of biobehavioral synchrony by which the parental brain shapes, and is shaped by, infant physiology and behavior emphasize the brain basis of caregiving for the cross-generation transmission of human sociality.","Cardiac abnormalities are the most common birth defects. Derangement of circulatory flow affects many vital organs; without proper supply of oxygenated blood, the brain is particularly vulnerable. Although surgical interventions have greatly reduced mortality rates, patients often suffer an array of neurological deficits throughout life. Neuroimaging provides a macroscopic assessment of brain injury and has shown that white matter (WM) is at risk. Oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons have been identified as major targets of WM injury, but still little is known about how congenital heart anomalies affect the brain at the cellular level. Further integration of animal model studies and clinical research will define novel therapeutic targets and new standards of care to prevent developmental delay associated with cardiac abnormalities.","Depression is a common cause of mortality and morbidity, but the biological bases of the deficits in emotional and cognitive processing remain incompletely understood. Current antidepressant therapies are effective in only some patients and act slowly. Here, we propose an excitatory synapse hypothesis of depression in which chronic stress and genetic susceptibility cause changes in the strength of subsets of glutamatergic synapses at multiple locations, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc), leading to a dysfunction of corticomesolimbic reward circuitry that underlies many of the symptoms of depression. This hypothesis accounts for current depression treatments and suggests an updated framework for the development of better therapeutic compounds.",The stratified motor cortex is variously thought to either lack or contain layer 4. Yamawaki et al. described a functional layer 4 in mouse motor cortex with properties and connections similar to layer 4 in sensory areas. Their results bolster a theoretical framework suggesting all primary cortical areas are equivalent.,"The central extended amygdala is an evolutionarily conserved set of interconnected brain regions that play an important role in threat processing to promote survival. Two core components of the central extended amygdala, the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) are highly similar regions that serve complimentary roles by integrating fear- and anxiety-relevant information. Survival depends on the ability of the central extended amygdala to rapidly integrate and respond to threats that vary in their immediacy, proximity, and characteristics. Future studies will benefit from understanding alterations in central extended amygdala function in relation to stress-related psychopathology.","The role of the amygdala in emotion and social perception has been intensively investigated primarily through studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently, this topic has been examined using single-unit recordings in both humans and monkeys, with a focus on face processing. The findings provide novel insights, including several surprises: amygdala neurons have very long response latencies, show highly nonlinear responses to whole faces, and can be exquisitely selective for very specific parts of faces such as the eyes. In humans, the responses of amygdala neurons correlate with internal states evoked by faces, rather than with their objective features. Current and future studies extend the investigations to psychiatric illnesses such as autism, in which atypical face processing is a hallmark of social dysfunction.","Hahamy and colleagues demonstrate individualized alterations of functional connectivity in the brains of adults with autism, suggesting that previous characterizations of general under- or over-connectivity may be overly simplistic. Adopting a developmental perspective spanning both cortical and subcortical landscapes will further clarify the nature and extent of these atypicalities.","The corpus callosum connects the two cortical hemispheres of the mammalian brain and is susceptible to structural defects during development, which often result in significant neuropsychological dysfunction. To date, such individuals have been studied primarily with regards to the integrity of the callosal tract at the midline. However, the mechanisms regulating the contralateral targeting of the corpus callosum, after midline crossing has occurred, are less well understood. Recent evidence suggests that defects in contralateral targeting can occur in isolation from midline-tract malformations, and may have significant functional implications. We propose that contralateral targeting is a crucially important and relatively under-investigated event in callosal development, and that defects in this process may constitute an undiagnosed phenotype in several neurological disorders.","Neuroscience has historically exploited a wide diversity of animal taxa. Recently, however, research has focused increasingly on a few model species. This trend has accelerated with the genetic revolution, as genomic sequences and genetic tools became available for a few species, which formed a bottleneck. This coalescence on a small set of model species comes with several costs that are often not considered, especially in the current drive to use mice explicitly as models for human diseases. Comparative studies of strategically chosen non-model species can complement model species research and yield more rigorous studies. As genetic sequences and tools become available for many more species, we are poised to emerge from the bottleneck and once again exploit the rich biological diversity offered by comparative studies.","The classification of neurons into types has been much debated since the inception of modern neuroscience. Recent experimental advances are accelerating the pace of data collection. The resulting growth of information about morphological, physiological, and molecular properties encourages efforts to automate neuronal classification by powerful machine learning techniques. We review state-of-the-art analysis approaches and the availability of suitable data and resources, highlighting prominent challenges and opportunities. The effective solution of the neuronal classification problem will require continuous development of computational methods, high-throughput data production, and systematic metadata organization to enable cross-laboratory integration.","The current view posits that objects, despite changes in appearance, are uniquely encoded by 'expert' cells. This view is untenable. First, even if cell ensemble responses are invariant and unique, we are consciously aware of all of the objects' details. Second, in addition to detail preservation, data show that the current hypothesis fails to account for uniqueness and invariance. I present an alternative view whereby objects' representation and recognition are based on parallel representation of space by primary visual cortex (V1) responses. Information necessary for invariance and other attributes is handled in series by other cortical areas through integration, interpolation, and hierarchical convergence. The parallel and serial mechanisms combine to enable our flexible space perception. Only in this alternative view is conscious perception consistent with the underlying architecture.","Visual perception and eye movements are considered to be tightly linked. Diverse fields, ranging from developmental psychology to computer science, utilize eye tracking to measure visual perception. However, this prevailing view has been challenged by recent behavioral studies. Here, we review converging evidence revealing dissociations between the contents of perceptual awareness and different types of eye movement. Such dissociations reveal situations in which eye movements are sensitive to particular visual features that fail to modulate perceptual reports. We also discuss neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and clinical studies supporting the role of subcortical pathways for visual processing without awareness. Our review links awareness to perceptual-eye movement dissociations and furthers our understanding of the brain pathways underlying vision and movement with and without awareness.","As critical players in gene regulation, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are taking center stage in our understanding of cellular function and disease. In our era of bench-top sequencers and unprecedented computational power, biological questions can be addressed in a systematic, genome-wide manner. Development of high-throughput sequencing (Seq) methodologies provides unparalleled potential to discover new mechanisms of disease-associated perturbations of RNA homeostasis. Complementary to candidate single-gene studies, these innovative technologies may elicit the discovery of unexpected mechanisms, and enable us to determine the widespread influence of the multifunctional RBPs on their targets. Given that the disruption of RNA processing is increasingly implicated in neurological diseases, these approaches will continue to provide insights into the roles of RBPs in disease pathogenesis.","Two recent monkey studies demonstrate that feedforward processing in the visual system is reflected by activity in the 40-90Hz gamma band, whereas feedback is reflected by activity in the 5-18Hz alpha and beta band. These findings can be applied to interpret human electrophysiological activity in complex visual tasks.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2015 Sep;38(9):579.,"How is space represented in the visual system? At first glance, the answer to this fundamental question appears straightforward: spatial information is directly encoded in the locations of neurons within maps. This concept has long dominated visual neuroscience, leading to mainstream theories of how neurons encode information. However, an accumulation of evidence indicates that this purely spatial view is incomplete and that, even for static images, the representation is fundamentally spatiotemporal. The evidence for this new understanding centers on recent experimental findings concerning the functional role of fixational eye movements, the tiny movements humans and other species continually perform, even when attending to a single point. We review some of these findings and discuss their functional implications.","The neural and molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior - including their functional significance and evolution - can only be fully understood using data obtained under multiple social, environmental, and physiological conditions. Understanding the complexity of social behavior requires integration across levels of analysis in both laboratory and field settings. However, there is currently a disconnect between the systems studied in the laboratory versus the field. We argue that recent conceptual and technical advances provide exciting new opportunities to close this gap by making non-model organisms accessible to modern approaches in both laboratory and nature.","Opioids are the most potent analgesics in clinical use; however, their powerful rewarding properties can lead to addiction. The scientific challenge is to retain analgesic potency while limiting the development of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. Both rewarding and analgesic actions of opioids depend upon actions at the mu opioid (MOP) receptor. Systemic opioid reward requires MOP receptor function in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) which contains dopaminergic neurons. VTA dopaminergic neurons are implicated in various aspects of reward including reward prediction error, working memory, and incentive salience. It is now clear that subsets of VTA neurons have different pharmacological properties and participate in separate circuits. The degree to which MOP receptor agonists act on different VTA circuits depends upon the behavioral state of the animal, which can be altered by manipulations such as food deprivation or prior exposure to MOP receptor agonists.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is an insidious and incurable neurodegenerative disease, and represents a significant cost to individuals, carers, and ageing societies. It is defined at post-mortem by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra together with the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We examine here the role of α-synuclein and other cellular transport proteins implicated in PD and how their aberrant activity may be compounded by the unique anatomy of the dopaminergic neuron. This review uses multiple lines of evidence from genetic studies, human tissue, induced pluripotent stem cells, and refined animal models to argue that prodromal PD can be defined as a disease of impaired intracellular trafficking. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic synapse heralds trafficking impairment.","As we age, movements become slower and inconsistent and require more attention. These hallmarks of aging suggest a switch from predictive to reactive motor control. Here I examine evidence supporting the hypothesis that motor aging is primarily determined by the early death of neurons in the cerebellum, a critical structure for predictive motor control.","Mammalian auditory hair cells do not spontaneously regenerate, unlike hair cells in lower vertebrates, including fish and birds. In mammals, hearing loss due to the loss of hair cells is permanent and intractable. Recent studies in the mouse have demonstrated spontaneous hair cell regeneration during a short postnatal period, but this regenerative capacity is lost in the adult cochlea. Reduced regeneration coincides with a transition that results in a decreased pool of progenitor cells in the cochlear sensory epithelium. Here, we review the signaling cascades involved in hair cell formation and morphogenesis of the organ of Corti in developing mammals, the changing status of progenitor cells in the cochlea, and the regeneration of auditory hair cells in adult mammals.","The study of neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders has been shaped by learning models that frame anxiety as maladaptive learning. Pavlovian conditioning and extinction are particularly influential in defining learning stages that can account for symptoms of anxiety disorders. Recently, dynamic and task related communication between the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged as a crucial aspect of successful evaluation of threat and safety. Ongoing patterns of neural signaling within the mPFC-BLA circuit during encoding, expression and extinction of adaptive learning are reviewed. The mechanisms whereby deficient mPFC-BLA interactions can lead to generalized fear and anxiety are discussed in learned and innate anxiety. Findings with cross-species validity are emphasized.","Neurogenesis is an important process in the regulation of brain function and behaviour, highly active in early development and continuing throughout life. Recent studies have shown that neurogenesis is modulated by inflammatory cytokines in response to an activated immune system. To disentangle the effects of the different cytokines on neurogenesis, here we summarise and discuss in vitro studies on individual cytokines. We show that inflammatory cytokines have both a positive and negative role on proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Hence, this strengthens the notion that inflammation is involved in molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with complex cognitive processes and, therefore, that alterations in brain-immune communication are relevant to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Histaminergic neurons are exclusively located in the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus, from where they project to many brain areas. The histaminergic system is involved in basic physiological functions, such as the sleep-wake cycle, energy and endocrine homeostasis, sensory and motor functions, cognition, and attention, which are all severely affected in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present recent postmortem findings on the alterations in this system in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), depression, and narcolepsy. In addition, we highlight the need to validate animal models for these diseases and also for Tourette's syndrome (TS) in relation to alterations in the histaminergic system. Moreover, we discuss the potential for, and concerns over, the use of novel histamine 3 receptor (H3R) antagonists/inverse agonists as treatment for such disorders.","Elevated dopamine function and alterations in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure and function are two of the most robust findings in schizophrenia, but how interactions between these abnormalities underlie the onset of psychosis is unclear. The methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model proposes that psychosis develops as a result of a perturbation of MTL function, leading to elevated striatal dopamine dysfunction. Here, we review several recent neuroimaging studies that examine components of the putative model in humans with an ultra high risk (UHR) of the psychosis. While data from these studies are broadly consistent with the MAM model, caution is required when comparing data across animal and human studies.","Navigation depends upon neural systems that monitor spatial location and head orientation. Recent developmental findings have led some to conclude that these systems are innate. Such claims are premature. But also, there are more meaningful ways to arrive at answers about developmental origins than by invoking the outdated nature-nurture dichotomy.","Gene expression and regulation is an important sculptor of the behavior of organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression not by altering the genetic alphabet but rather by the addition of chemical modifications to proteins associated with the alphabet or of methyl marks to the alphabet itself. Being dynamic, epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation serve as an important bridge between environmental stimuli and genotype. In this review, we outline epigenetic mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated in animals and humans. Using fear learning as a framework, we then delineate how such mechanisms underlie learning and stress responsiveness. Finally, we discuss how epigenetic mechanisms might inform us about the transgenerational inheritance of behavioral traits that are being increasingly reported.","Coherent β-oscillations are a dominant feature of the sensorimotor system yet their function remains enigmatic. We propose that, in addition to cell intrinsic and/or local network interactions, they are supported by activity propagating recurrently around closed neural 'loops' between primary motor cortex (M1), muscles, and back to M1 via somatosensory pathways. Individual loops reciprocally connect individual muscle synergies ('motor primitives') with their representations in M1, and the conduction time around each loop resonates with the periodic spiking of its constituent neurons/muscles. During β-oscillations, this resonance strengthens within-loop connectivity (via long-term potentiation, LTP), whereas non-resonance between different loops weakens connectivity (via long-term depression, LTD) between M1 representations of different muscle synergies. In this way, β-oscillations help maintain accurate and discrete representations of muscle synergies in M1.","Traditionally, studies of how pain and attention modulate one another involved explicit cognitive-state manipulations. However, emerging evidence suggests that spontaneous brain-wide network communication is intrinsically dynamic on multiple timescales, and attentional states are in constant fluctuation. Here, in light of studies on neural mechanisms of spontaneous attentional fluctuations and pain variability, we introduce the concept of a dynamic 'pain connectome' in the brain. We describe how recent progress in our understanding of individual differences in intrinsic attention to pain and neural network dynamics in chronic pain can facilitate development of personalized pain therapies. Furthermore, we emphasize that the dynamics of pain-attention interactions must be accounted for in the contemporary search for a 'neural signature' of the pain connectome.","Local signaling events at synapses or axon terminals must be communicated to the nucleus to elicit transcriptional responses. The lengths of neuronal processes pose a significant challenge for such intracellular communication. This challenge is met by mechanisms ranging from rapid signals encoded in calcium waves to slower macromolecular signaling complexes carried by molecular motors. Here we summarize recent findings on macromolecular signaling from the synapse to the nucleus, in comparison to those employed in injury signaling along axons. A number of common themes emerge, including combinatorial signal encoding by post-translational mechanisms such as differential phosphorylation and proteolysis, and conserved roles for importins in coordinating signaling complexes. Neurons may integrate ionic flux with motor-transported signals as a temporal code for synaptic plasticity signaling.","The mammalian cerebral cortex is responsible for the highest levels of associative, cognitive and motor functions. In the central nervous system (CNS) the cortex stands as a prime example of extreme neuronal diversity, broadly classified into excitatory projection neurons (PNs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs). We review here recent progress made in understanding the strategies and mechanisms that shape PN diversity during embryogenesis, and discuss how PN classes may be maintained, postnatally, for the life of the organism. In addition, we consider the intriguing possibility that PNs may be amenable to directed reprogramming of their class-specific features to allow enhanced cortical plasticity in the adult.","Increase in the area and neuron number of the cerebral cortex over evolutionary time systematically changes its computational properties. One of the fundamental developmental mechanisms generating the cortex is a conserved rostrocaudal gradient in duration of neuron production, coupled with distinct asymmetries in the patterns of axon extension and synaptogenesis on the same axis. A small set of conserved sensorimotor areas with well-defined thalamic input anchors the rostrocaudal axis. These core mechanisms organize the cortex into two contrasting topographic zones, while systematically amplifying hierarchical organization on the rostrocaudal axis in larger brains. Recent work has shown that variation in 'cognitive control' in multiple species correlates best with absolute brain size, and this may be the behavioral outcome of this progressive organizational change.","Brain energy metabolism powers information processing and behavior, much as electricity powers a computer. However, a recent study in insects suggests that this relationship is more interesting, causally linking aggressive behavior to energetics. These findings may also shed new light on aerobic glycolysis, a long-standing riddle of human brain physiology.","Chronic microinflammation is a hallmark of many aging-related neurodegenerative diseases as well as metabolic syndrome-driven diseases. Recent research indicates that chronic caloric excess can lead to hypothalamic microinflammation, which in turn participates in the development and progression of metabolic syndrome disorders such as obesity, glucose intolerance, and hypertension. Additionally, it was recently shown that increasing age after young adulthood can cause hypothalamic microinflammation independently of nutritional status, mediating a central mechanism of systemic aging. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hypothalamus has a fundamental role, via hypothalamic microinflammation, in translating overnutrition and aging into complex outcomes. Here we summarize recent work and suggest a conceptual model in which hypothalamic microinflammation is a common mediator of metabolic syndrome and aging.","As focus shifts to large-scale network interactions involved in memory, it is becoming increasingly clear that oscillatory dynamics are critically involved. A number of studies have shown a negative correlation between memory retrieval in alpha and beta power, and a positive correlation between retrieval and theta power. In this opinion article, we suggest three thalamic sub-regions responsible for the coordination of oscillatory activity and the facilitation of memory processes. Specifically, the medial dorsal nucleus is related to changes in beta synchrony, the pulvinar is responsible for alpha synchrony, and the anterior thalamus is related to theta synchrony. These pathways may be modulated via frontal control, and changes in oscillations could be used to track the engagement of underlying memory systems.","Sensory systems project information in a highly organized manner to the brain, where it is preserved in maps of the sensory structures. These sensory projections are altered in congenital abnormalities, such as anophthalmia, albinism, achiasma, and hemihydranencephaly. Consequently, these abnormalities, profoundly affect the organization of the visual system. Surprisingly, visual perception remains largely intact, except for anophthalmia. Recent brain imaging advances shed light on the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. In contrast to animal models, in humans the plasticity of thalamocortical connections appears limited, thus demonstrating the importance of cortical adaptations. We suggest that congenital visual pathway abnormalities provide a valuable model to investigate the principles of plasticity that make visual representations available for perception and behavior in humans.","Dendrites are the predominant entry site for excitatory synaptic potentials in most types of central neurons. There is increasing evidence that dendrites are not just passive transmitting devices but play active roles in synaptic integration through linear and non-linear mechanisms. Frequently, excitatory synapses are formed on dendritic spines. In addition to relaying incoming electrical signals, spines can play important roles in modifying these signals through complex biochemical processes and, thereby, determine learning and memory formation. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the function of spines and dendrites in central mammalian neurons in vivo by focusing particularly on insights obtained from Ca(2+) imaging studies.","Autophagy is an important biological process that is essential for the removal of damaged organelles and toxic or aggregated proteins by delivering them to the lysosome for degradation. Consequently, autophagy has become a primary target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases that involve aggregating proteins. In Huntington disease (HD), an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the N-terminus of the huntingtin (HTT) protein leads to protein aggregation. However, HD is unique among the neurodegenerative proteinopathies in that autophagy is not only dysfunctional but wild type (wt) HTT also appears to play several roles in regulating the dynamics of autophagy. Herein, we attempt to integrate the recently described novel roles of wtHTT and altered autophagy in HD.",The use of autism as a diagnostic category guiding translational research is fraught with so many problems that the validity of research conclusions is suspect. Neuroscientists would benefit from attending to nosological difficulties to formulate meaningful research bridging basic biological systems and human disease. I propose a diagnostic schema that could translate more efficiently between the clinical and the neuroscience perspective as a step to improve the effectiveness of this type of research.,"Two recent crystallographic studies of the full-length GluA2 AMPA receptor provide our first insights into how the modular domains of the tetrameric complex coordinate the process of activation. These findings herald a new era in the structure-function analyses of neurotransmitter receptors, a fitting achievement for the 'International Year of Crystallography'.","Traditionally, different classes of cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents are ascribed different and largely non-overlapping functional roles (for example texture or motion) stemming from their different response properties. This functional segregation is thought to be reflected in cortex, where each neuron receives input from a single submodality. We summarize work that challenges this notion. First, while it is possible to design artificial stimuli that preferentially excite a single afferent class, most natural stimuli excite all afferents and most tactile percepts are shaped by multiple submodalities. Second, closer inspection of cortical responses reveals that most neurons receive convergent input from multiple afferent classes. We argue that cortical neurons should be grouped based on their function rather than on their submodality composition.","Tau is a microtubule-associated-protein that is sorted into neuronal axons in physiological conditions. In Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies, Tau sorting mechanisms fail and Tau becomes missorted into the somatodendritic compartment. In AD, aberrant amyloid-β (Aβ) production might trigger Tau missorting. The physiological axonal sorting of Tau depends on the developmental stage of the neuron, the phosphorylation state of Tau and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Disease-associated missorting of Tau is connected to increased phosphorylation and aggregation of Tau, and impaired microtubule interactions. Disease-causing mechanisms involve impaired transport, aberrant kinase activation, non-physiological interactions of Tau, and prion-like spreading. In this review we focus on the physiological and pathological (mis)sorting of Tau, the underlying mechanisms, and effects in disease.","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders stemming from dysregulated fear memory are problematic and costly. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of these persistent fear associations is crucial to developing treatments for PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms, which control gene expression to produce long-lasting changes in cellular function, may support the formation of fear memory underlying PTSD. We address here the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the formation, storage, updating, and extinction of fear memories. We also discuss methods of targeting these epigenetic mechanisms to reduce the initial formation of fear memory or to enhance its extinction. Epigenetic mechanisms may provide a novel target for pharmaceutical and other treatments to reduce aversive memory contributing to PTSD.","Intermediate phenotypes are traits positioned somewhere between genetic variation and disease. They represent a target for attempts to find disease-associated genetic variants and elucidation of mechanisms. Psychiatry has been particularly enamoured with intermediate phenotypes, due to uncertainty about disease aetiology, inconclusive results in early psychiatric genetic studies, and their appeal relative to traditional diagnostic categories. In this review, we argue that new genetic findings are relevant to the question of the utility of these constructs. In particular, results from genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders now allow an assessment of the potential role of particular intermediate phenotypes. Based on such an analysis, as well as other recent results, we conclude that intermediate phenotypes are likely to be most valuable in understanding mechanism.","In recent years there has been an exponential rise in the number of studies employing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a means of gaining a systems-level understanding of the cortical substrates underlying behaviour. These advances have allowed inferences to be made regarding the neural operations that shape perception, cognition, and action. Here we summarise how tDCS works, and show how research using this technique is expanding our understanding of the neural basis of cognitive and motor training. We also explain how oscillatory tDCS can elucidate the role of fluctuations in neural activity, in both frequency and phase, in perception, learning, and memory. Finally, we highlight some key methodological issues for tDCS and suggest how these can be addressed.","Unlike the nonexcitable cell membranes that are ubiquitous in all domains of life, excitable membranes are found almost exclusively in animal organisms (Protozoa and Metazoa). Their transient permeability to ion flow makes possible the rapid detection of, and response to, external stimuli, and results in the phenomena that most clearly distinguish fauna from flora: perception, cognition, and motor activity. Interestingly, all known forms of membrane excitability are a consequence of one unique mechanism: the influx of positively charged ions into the normally alkaline cytoplasm. Here, we suggest that the sudden reversal of the membrane potential during the sensory potential and the action potential is an electrostatic disturbance of homeostasis that is the necessary first step in the processes of 'sentience' and 'irritability'.","Influential models propose that conscious experience of extrastriate activity requires the integrity of primary visual cortex (V1). A new study challenges this view by demonstrating that when V1 is lesioned, visual qualia can be induced when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied over the patients' ipsilesional hemisphere.","Giacomo Rizzolatti, Stanislas Dehaene, and Trevor Robbins were recently awarded the 2014 Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize for their 'pioneering research on higher brain mechanisms underpinning such complex human functions as literacy, numeracy, motivated behavior and social cognition, and for their effort to understand cognitive and behavioral disorders'. Why was their work highlighted? Is there anything that links together these seemingly disparate lines of research?",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2015 Jun;38(6):331-2.,"Long-term depression (LTD) of the efficacy of synaptic transmission is now recognized as an important mechanism for the regulation of information storage and the control of actions, as well as for synapse, neuron, and circuit development. Studies of LTD mechanisms have focused mainly on postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptor trafficking. However, the focus has now expanded to include presynaptically expressed plasticity, the predominant form being initiated by presynaptically expressed Gi/o-coupled metabotropic receptor (Gi/o-GPCR) activation. Several forms of LTD involving activation of different presynaptic Gi/o-GPCRs as a 'common pathway' are described. We review here the literature on presynaptic Gi/o-GPCR-mediated LTD, discuss known mechanisms, gaps in our knowledge, and evaluate whether all Gi/o-GPCRs are capable of inducing presynaptic LTD.","Hierarchical social status greatly influences behavior and health. Human and animal studies have begun to identify the brain regions that are activated during the formation of social hierarchies. They point towards the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a central regulator, with brain areas upstream of the PFC conveying information about social status, and downstream brain regions executing dominance behavior. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the neural circuits that control social status. We discuss how the neural mechanisms for various types of dominance behavior can be studied in laboratory rodents by selective manipulation of neuronal activity or synaptic plasticity. These studies may help in finding the cause of social stress-related mental and physical health problems.","Stem cell technologies have created new opportunities to generate unlimited numbers of human neurons in the lab and study neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Although some disease hallmarks have been reported in patient-derived stem cell models, it is proving more difficult to recapitulate the full phenotypic extent of these disorders. The problem with these stem cell models lies in the disparity between the advanced age of onset of neurodegenerative disorders and the embryonic nature of the in vitro derived cell types. In this review we discuss experimental methods of in vitro aging of neural cell types as a means to elicit late-onset symptoms in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of neurodegenerative disease.","Over the past decades, developments in neuroimaging have significantly contributed to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Specifically, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents targeting amyloid deposition have provided unprecedented opportunities for refining in vivo diagnosis, monitoring disease propagation, and advancing AD clinical trials. Furthermore, the use of a miniaturized version of PET (microPET) in transgenic (Tg) animals has been a successful strategy for accelerating the development of novel radiopharmaceuticals. However, advanced applications of microPET focusing on the longitudinal propagation of AD pathophysiology or therapeutic strategies remain in their infancy. This review highlights what we have learned from microPET imaging in Tg models displaying amyloid and tau pathology, and anticipates cutting-edge applications with high translational value to clinical research.","Although it has been known for decades that hippocampal calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an essential role in learning and memory consolidation, the roles of CaMKII in other brain regions are only recently being explored in depth. A series of recent studies suggest that CaMKII dysfunction throughout the brain may underlie myriad neuropsychiatric disorders, including drug addiction, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, perhaps through maladaptations in glutamate signaling and neuroplasticity. I review here the structure, function, subcellular localization, and expression patterns of CaMKII isoforms, as well as recent advances demonstrating that disturbances in these properties may contribute to psychiatric disorders.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2014.08.002 PMID: 25288199  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2014.09.004 PMID: 25266364  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Learning can involve formation of new synapses and loss of synapses, providing memory traces of learned skills. Recent findings suggest that these synapse rearrangements reflect assembly of task-related sub-circuits from initially broadly distributed and sparse connectivity in the brain. These local circuit remodeling processes involve rapid emergence of synapses upon learning, followed by protracted validation involving strengthening of some new synapses, and selective elimination of others. The timing of these consolidation processes can vary. Here, we review these findings, focusing on how molecular/cellular mechanisms of synapse assembly, strengthening, and elimination might interface with circuit/system mechanisms of learning and memory consolidation. An integrated understanding of these learning-related processes should provide a better basis to elucidate how experience, genetic background, and disease influence brain function.",Comment on Nature. 2014 Jul 31;511(7511):596-600.,"The birth of new neurons in the walls of the adult brain lateral ventricles has captured the attention of many neuroscientists for over 2 decades, yielding key insights into the identity and regulation of neural stem cells (NSCs). In the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), NSCs are a specialized form of astrocyte that generates several types of neurons for the olfactory bulb. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the unique organization of the V-SVZ NSC niche, the multiple regulatory controls of neuronal production, the distinct regional identities of adult NSCs, and the epigenetic mechanisms that maintain adult neurogenesis. Understanding how V-SVZ NSCs establish and maintain lifelong neurogenesis continues to provide surprising insights into the cellular and molecular regulation of neural development.","Commissural neurons project their axons across the midline of the nervous system to contact neurons on the opposite side. Although their existence has been known for more than a century, the function of brain commissures, as well as their diversity and evolutionary advantage, are far from understood. Recent genetic studies in mammals have led to the identification of subsets of commissural neurons, which, in the hindbrain and spinal cord, control the tuning and bilateral coordination of locomotion. The molecular mechanisms and transcriptional programs which specify axonal laterality during development are also now being elucidated. Finally, new studies have confirmed that axonal laterality is plastic and that facilitating the commissural sprouting of axon collaterals might influence functional recovery after brain injury.","It is widely recognized that severed axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) have limited capacity to regenerate. However, mounting evidence from studies of CNS injury response and repair is challenging the prevalent view that the adult mammalian CNS is incapable of structural reorganization to adapt to an altered environment. Animal studies demonstrate the potential to achieve significant anatomical repair and functional recovery following CNS injury by manipulating axon growth regulators alone or in combination with activity-dependent strategies. With a growing understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating axon plasticity, and the availability of new experimental tools to map detour circuits of functional importance, directing circuit rewiring to promote functional recovery may be achieved.","During development, neural circuits are initially generated by exuberant innervation and are rapidly refined by selective preservation and elimination of axons. The establishment and maintenance of functional circuits therefore requires coordination of axon survival and degeneration pathways. Both developing and mature circuits rely on interdependent mitochondrial and cytoskeletal components to maintain axonal health and homeostasis; injury or diseases that impinge on these components frequently cause pathologic axon loss. Here, we review recent findings that identify mechanisms of axonal preservation in the contexts of development, injury, and disease.","Developing neuronal circuits often undergo a period of refinement to eliminate aberrant synaptic connections. Inappropriate connections can also form among surviving neurons during neuronal degeneration. The laminar organization of the vertebrate retina enables synaptic reorganization to be readily identified. Synaptic rearrangements are shown to help sculpt developing retinal circuits, although the mechanisms involved remain debated. Structural changes in retinal diseases can also lead to functional rewiring. This poses a major challenge to retinal repair because it may be necessary to untangle the miswired connections before reconnecting with proper synaptic partners. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie circuit remodeling during retinal development, and discuss how alterations in connectivity during damage could impede circuit repair.","The mammalian brain consists of a complex ensemble of neurons and glia. Their production during development and remodeling is tightly controlled by various regulatory mechanisms in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Among such regulations, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors have key functions in the self-renewal, multipotency, and fate determination of NPCs. Here, we highlight the importance of the expression dynamics of bHLH factors in these processes. The oscillatory expression of multiple bHLH factors is correlated with the multipotent and self-renewable state, whereas sustained expression of a selected bHLH factor regulates fate determination. We also discuss potential mechanisms by which a single bHLH factor can exhibit versatile functions in NPC regulation as well as the hierarchical structure of the bHLH factor oscillatory network.","The function of neural circuits depends on the precise connectivity between populations of neurons. Increasing evidence indicates that disruptions in excitatory or inhibitory synapse formation or function lead to excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalances and contribute to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing surface proteins have emerged as key organizers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Distinct LRR proteins are expressed in different cell types and interact with key pre- and postsynaptic proteins. These protein interaction networks allow LRR proteins to coordinate pre- and postsynaptic elements during synapse formation and differentiation, pathway-specific synapse development, and synaptic plasticity. LRR proteins, therefore, play a critical role in organizing synaptic connections into functional neural circuits, and their dysfunction may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.","How we choose one action over another has intrigued neuroscientists for decades. Early models of decision-making involved a race between processes representing alternative choices. To explain behaviour in complex decisions, for example, where one must cancel an impending action, a Stop unit must also join the race. Recent neuronal recordings have demonstrated just such a race between Go and Stop processes in the basal ganglia. This is a landmark advance because it neurophysiologically justifies the need for a Stop process in such tasks, and very likely in other behaviours requiring rapid cancellation of impending actions.",Comment on Elife. 2014;3:e02076.,"Sleep is widely believed to play an essential role in synaptic plasticity. However, the precise mechanisms governing this presumptive function are largely unknown. There is also evidence for independent circadian oscillations in synaptic strength and morphology. Therefore, synaptic changes observed after sleep reflect interactions between state-dependent (e.g., wake versus sleep) and state-independent (circadian) processes. In this review we consider how sleep and biological clocks influence synaptic plasticity. We discuss these findings in the context of current plasticity-based theories of sleep function and propose a new model that integrates circadian and brain-state influences on synaptic plasticity.","During human response conflict - competition between multiple conflicting actions when a mistake could be made - a specific pattern of brain electrical activity occurs over the medial frontal cortex (MFC), characterized by modulations of ongoing theta-band (∼6Hz) oscillations and synchronization with task-relevant brain regions. Despite the replicable and robust findings linking MFC theta to conflict processing, the significance of MFC theta for how neural microcircuits actually detect conflict and broadcast that signal is unknown. A neural MFC microcircuit model is proposed for processing conflict and generating theta oscillations. The model makes several novel predictions for the causes and consequences of MFC theta and conflict processing, and may be relevant for understanding the neural implementations of related cognitive processes.","Over the past 5 years, the incorporation of optogenetics into the study of memory has resulted in a tremendous leap in this field, initiating a revolution in our understanding of the networks underlying cognitive processes. This review will present recent breakthroughs in which optogenetics was applied to illuminate, both literally and figuratively, memory research, and describe the technical approach, together with the opportunities it offers. Specifically, a large body of literature has been generated, setting the foundation for deciphering the spatiotemporal organization of hippocampal-based memory processing and its underlying mechanisms, as well as the contribution of cortical and amygdalar regions to cognition.","Staufen (Stau) proteins belong to a family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are important for RNA localisation in many organisms. In this review we discuss recent findings on the conserved role played by Stau during both the early differentiation of neurons and in the synaptic plasticity of mature neurons. Recent molecular data suggest mechanisms for how Stau2 regulates mRNA localisation, mRNA stability, translation, and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly. We offer a perspective on how this multifunctional RBP has been adopted to regulate mRNA localisation under several different cellular and developmental conditions.","Topographic organization is a hallmark of sensory cortical organization. Topography is robust at spatial scales ranging from hundreds of microns to centimeters, but can dissolve at the level of neighboring neurons or subcellular compartments within a neuron. This dichotomous spatial organization is especially pronounced in the mouse auditory cortex, where an orderly tonotopic map can arise from heterogeneous frequency tuning between local neurons. Here, we address a debate surrounding the robustness of tonotopic organization in the auditory cortex that has persisted in some form for over 40 years. Drawing from various cortical areas, cortical layers, recording methodologies, and species, we describe how auditory cortical circuitry can simultaneously support a globally systematic, yet locally heterogeneous representation of this fundamental sound property.","Discovery and interventions for neurological disorders have a unique capacity to galvanize public opinion over issues of access, human rights, decision making, and the definition of disease. Here we highlight five cases where beliefs and politics prevailed over evidence and ethics. We examine lessons from them about the communication of risk and the power of public influence on science, society, and policy.","Activity-controlled enzymatic cleavage of proteins on the surface of synaptic membranes or in the synaptic or perisynaptic interstitial compartment represents a direct way to regulate synaptic structure, function, and number. Extracellular proteolysis at synapses was initially understood to be plasticity enabling by freeing synapses from the constraints provided by the extracellular matrix. However, recent observations indicate that at least part of the extracellular protein cleavage results in activation of previously cryptic functions that regulate adaptive changes of synapses and neuronal circuits. Here, we focus on peptidases with distinct localization and function at synapses combined with regulation by neuronal and synaptic activity, and evaluate their function in the context of developmental and/or adult synaptic plasticity.","Guidance of axons to their targets in the developing nervous system requires a myriad of downstream signaling molecules to coordinate growth cone movement. One of the most important of these is calcium, and over the past few years many new insights have been gained into the role of calcium in axon guidance. In this review we focus on mechanisms of calcium entry into the growth cone and its downstream effects on both growth cone motility and turning. We particularly highlight the role of calcium concentrations in determining attractive versus repulsive responses to graded guidance cues, and their role in guidance by the morphogen Wnt5a.","A fundamental problem in systems neuroscience is mapping the physical properties of a stimulus to perceptual characteristics. In vision, wavelength translates into color; in audition, frequency translates into pitch. Although odorant concentration is a key feature of olfactory stimuli, we do not know how concentration is translated into perceived intensity by the olfactory system. A variety of neural responses at several levels of processing have been reported to vary with odorant concentration, suggesting specific coding models. However, it remains unclear which, if any, of these phenomena underlie the perception of odor intensity. Here, we provide an overview of current models at different stages of olfactory processing, and identify promising avenues for future research.","The prefrontal cortex regulates the expression of fear based on previously learned information. Recently, this brain area has emerged as being crucial in the initial formation of fear memories, providing new avenues to study the neurobiology underlying aberrant learning in anxiety disorders. Here we review the circumstances under which the prefrontal cortex is recruited in the formation of memory, highlighting relevant work in laboratory animals and human subjects. We propose that the prefrontal cortex facilitates fear memory through the integration of sensory and emotional signals and through the coordination of memory storage in an amygdala-based network.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequently occurring of the neuromuscular degenerative disorders, with a median survival time of 3-5 years. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ALS are multifactorial, with a complex interaction between genetic factors and molecular pathways. To date 16 genes and loci have been associated with ALS, with mutations in DNA/RNA-regulating genes including the recently described c9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) gene, suggesting an important role for dysregulation of RNA metabolism in ALS pathogenesis. Further, dysfunction of molecular pathways, including glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, has been identified in sporadic and familial ALS, indicating the existence of a common pathogenic pathway. These pathophysiological insights have suggested novel therapeutic approaches, including stem cell and genetics-based strategies, providing hope for feasible treatment of ALS.","The nervous system has the amazing capacity to transform sensory experience from the environment into changes in neuronal activity that, in turn, cause long-lasting alterations in neuronal morphology. Recent findings indicate that, surprisingly, sensory experience concurrently activates molecular signaling pathways that both promote and inhibit dendritic complexity. Historically, a number of positive regulators of activity-dependent dendritic complexity have been described, whereas the list of identified negative regulators of this process is much shorter. In recent years, there has been an emerging appreciation of the importance of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir (RGK) GTPases as mediators of activity-dependent structural plasticity. In the following review, we discuss the traditional view of RGK proteins, as well as our evolving understanding of the role of these proteins in instructing structural plasticity.","Mammals perform a multitude of well-coordinated orofacial behaviors such as breathing, sniffing, chewing, licking, swallowing, vocalizing, and in rodents, whisking. The coordination of these actions must occur without fault to prevent fatal blockages of the airway. Deciphering the neuronal circuitry that controls even a single action requires understanding the integration of sensory feedback and executive commands. A far greater challenge is to understand the coordination of multiple actions. Here, we focus on brainstem circuits that drive rhythmic orofacial actions. We discuss three neural computational mechanisms that may enable circuits for different actions to operate without interfering with each other. We conclude with proposed experimental programs for delineating the neural control principles that have evolved to coordinate orofacial behaviors.","The poor regenerative capacity of injured central nervous system (CNS) axons leads to permanent neurological deficits after brain, spinal cord, or optic nerve lesions. In the optic nerve, recent studies showed that stimulation of the cytokine or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways potently enhances sprouting and regeneration of injured retinal ganglion cell axons in adult mice, but does not allow the majority of axons to reach their main cerebral targets. New analyses have revealed axon navigation defects in the optic nerve and at the optic chiasm under conditions of strong growth stimulation. We propose that a balanced growth stimulatory treatment will have to be combined with guidance factors and suppression of local growth inhibitory factors to obtain the full regeneration of long CNS axonal tracts.","Sensory systems must rely on powerful mechanisms for organizing complex information. We propose a framework in which inhibitory alpha oscillations limit and prioritize neuronal processing. At oscillatory peaks, inhibition prevents neuronal firing. As the inhibition ramps down within a cycle, a set of neuronal representations will activate sequentially according to their respective excitability. Both top-down and bottom-up drives determine excitability; in particular, spatial attention is a major top-down influence. On a shorter time scale, fast recurrent inhibition segments representations in slots 10-30 ms apart, generating gamma-band activity at the population level. The proposed mechanism serves to convert spatially distributed representations in early visual regions to a temporal phase code: that is, 'to-do lists' that can be processed sequentially by downstream regions.","Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene are a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of progranulin in health and disease, because the field is now poised to begin examining therapeutics that alter endogenous progranulin levels. We first review the clinical and neuropathological phenotype of FTD patients carrying mutations in the progranulin gene, which suggests that progranulin-mediated neurodegeneration is multifactorial and influenced by other genetic and/or environmental factors. We then examine evidence for the role of progranulin in the brain with a focus on mouse model systems. A better understanding of the complexity of progranulin biology in the brain will help guide the development of progranulin-modulating therapies for neurodegenerative disease.","Chronic pain represents a major challenge to clinical practice and basic science. Excitatory neurotransmission in somatosensory nociceptive pathways is predominantly mediated by glutamatergic synapses. A key feature of these synapses is their ability to adapt synaptic strength in an activity-dependent manner. Such disease-induced synaptic plasticity is paramount to alterations in synaptic function and structure. Recent work has recognized that synaptic plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can function as a prime mechanism underlying pathological pain. In this review, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity in nociceptive pathways will be reviewed and discussed. New insights derived from these advances are expected to expedite development of novel interventional approaches for treatment of pathological pain.","Jin, Tecuapetla, and Costa combined in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetic-identification to examine firing in multiple basal ganglia nuclei during rapid motor sequences. Their results support a model of basal ganglia function in which co-activation of the direct and indirect pathways facilitate appropriate, while inhibiting competing, motor programs.","One hundred years ago, Edwin E. Goldmann discovered the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using trypan dyes. These dyes were developed and named by Paul Ehrlich during his search for drugs to kill African trypanosomes (extracellular parasites that cause sleeping sickness) while sparing host cells. For Ehrlich, this was the first strategy based on the 'chemotherapy' concept he had introduced. The discovery of the BBB revealed, however, the difficulties in drug delivery to the brain. Mechanisms by which parasites enter, dwell, and exit the brain currently provide novel views on cell trafficking across the BBB. These mechanisms also highlight the role of pericytes and endocytosis regulation in BBB functioning and in disrupted BBB gating, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2015 Jul;38(7):403-4. Trends Neurosci. 2015 Jul;38(7):401-2.,"The development of the cerebral cortex requires the tightly coordinated generation of dozens of neuronal subtypes that will populate specific layers and areas. Recent studies have revealed how pluripotent stem cells (PSC), whether of mouse or human origin, can differentiate into a wide range of cortical neurons in vitro, which can integrate appropriately into the brain following in vivo transplantation. These models are largely artificial but recapitulate a substantial fraction of the complex temporal and regional patterning events that occur during in vivo corticogenesis. Here, we review these findings with emphasis on the new perspectives that they have brought for understanding of cortical development, evolution, and diseases.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes a debilitating movement disorder. Although most cases of PD appear to be sporadic, rare Mendelian forms have provided tremendous insight into disease pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that impaired mitochondria underpin PD pathology. In support of this theory, data from multiple PD models have linked Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and parkin, two recessive PD genes, in a common pathway impacting mitochondrial health, prompting a flurry of research to identify their mitochondrial targets. Recent work has focused on the role of PINK1 and parkin in mediating mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy); however, emerging evidence casts parkin and PINK1 as key players in multiple domains of mitochondrial health and quality control.","Interaural time differences (ITDs) represent an important cue in sound localization and auditory scene analysis. To assess this cue the auditory system internally delays binaural inputs to compensate for the outer delay, before neurons in the brainstem detect the coincident arrival of the inputs from the two ears. Different origins of internal delays have been controversially discussed and have given rise to conflicting interpretations of the ITD representation ensuing from coincidence detection. Yet, recent findings indicate that ITD representations undergo substantial transformations or remodeling after the detection step. Here we treat the detection step separately from remodeling, and explain why a similar representation of ITD across species may exist in the forebrain despite differences in detection and representation in the midbrain.","The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a new important species for studying mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction. Focusing on selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (brain cancer, epilepsy, and anxiety) and using them as examples, we discuss the value of zebrafish models in translational neuroscience. We further evaluate the contribution of zebrafish to neuroimaging, circuit level, and drug discovery research. Outlining the role of zebrafish in modeling a wide range of human brain disorders, we also summarize recent applications and existing challenges in this field. Finally, we emphasize the potential of zebrafish models in behavioral phenomics and high-throughput genetic/small molecule screening, which is critical for CNS drug discovery and identifying novel candidate genes.","Traumatic experience can be overwhelming, thus erasing associated memories is desirable. Although exposure-based and reconsolidation methods have been developed for recently acquired associations, treatments to modify more distant memories are rare. Focusing on HDAC2 inhibition during reconsolidation, Gräff and colleagues recently demonstrated an epigenetic means to attenuate remote fear memory.","Telomeres, ribonucleoprotein complexes that cap eukaryotic chromosomes, typically shorten in leukocytes with aging. Aging is a primary risk factor for neurodegenerative disease (ND), and a common assumption has arisen that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) can serve as a predictor of neurological disease. However, the evidence for shorter LTL in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients is inconsistent. The diverse causes of telomere shortening may explain variability in LTL between studies and individuals. Additional research is needed to determine whether neuronal and glial telomeres shorten during aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, if and how LTL is related to brain cell telomere shortening, and whether telomere shortening plays a causal role in or exacerbates neurological disorders.","Humans have exceptionally long lifespans compared with other mammals. However, our longevity evolved when our ancestors had two copies of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele, a genotype that leads to a high risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality. How did human aging evolve within this genetic constraint? Drawing from neuroscience, anthropology, and brain-imaging research, we propose the hypothesis that the evolution of increased physical activity approximately 2 million years ago served to reduce the amyloid plaque and vascular burden of APOE ɛ4, relaxing genetic constraints on aging. This multidisciplinary approach links human evolution with health and provides a complementary perspective on aging and neurodegenerative disease that may help identify key mechanisms and targets for intervention.","During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, skeletal muscles are almost paralyzed. However, in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is a rare neurological condition, muscle atonia is lost, leaving afflicted individuals free to enact their dreams. Although this may sound innocuous, it is not, given that patients with RBD often injure themselves or their bed-partner. A major concern in RBD is that it precedes, in 80% of cases, development of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This link suggests that neurodegenerative processes initially target the circuits controlling REM sleep. Clinical and basic neuroscience evidence indicates that RBD results from breakdown of the network underlying REM sleep atonia. This finding is important because it opens new avenues for treating RBD and understanding its link to neurodegenerative disorders.","Phasic increases in brain dopamine are required for cue-directed reward seeking. Although compelling within the framework of appetitive behavior, the view that illicit drugs hijack reward circuits by hyperactivating these dopamine transients is inconsistent with established psychostimulant pharmacology. However, recent work reclassifying amphetamine (AMPH), cocaine, and other addictive dopamine-transporter inhibitors (DAT-Is) supports transient hyperactivation as a unifying hypothesis of abused drugs. We argue here that reclassification also identifies generating burst firing by dopamine neurons as a keystone action. Unlike natural rewards, which are processed by sensory systems, drugs act directly on the brain. Consequently, to mimic natural rewards and exploit reward circuits, dopamine transients must be elicited de novo. Of available drug targets, only burst firing achieves this essential outcome.","Alcohol is frequently consumed for stress relief, but the individual determinants and the temporal course of stress-induced alcohol use are not well understood. Preclinical studies may help shed light on these factors. We synthesize here the findings from numerous rodent studies of stress and alcohol interactions. Stress-induced alcohol consumption is age-dependent, has a high genetic load, and results from an interaction of the stress and reward systems. Specifically, glucocorticoids, acting within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), are important mediators of this stress-induced alcohol intake. In addition, increased activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system within the extended amygdala appears to mediate stress-induced relapse. Finally, these preclinical studies have helped to identify several attractive targets for novel treatments of alcohol abuse and addiction.","Understanding how proteins protect themselves from aberrant aggregation is of primary interest for understanding basic biology, protein biochemistry, and human disease. We discuss the paradigmatic example of ataxin-1 (Atx1), the protein responsible for neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). This disease is part of the increasing family of pathologies caused by protein aggregation and misfolding. We discuss the importance of protein-protein interactions not only in the nonpathological function of Atx1 but also in protecting the protein from aggregation and misfolding. The lessons learned from Atx1 may lead to a more general understanding of the cell's protective strategies against aggregation. The obtained knowledge may suggest a new perspective for designing specific therapeutic strategies for the cure of misfolding diseases.","Although histamine H3 receptors are predominantly known as presynaptic receptors, regulating the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and histamine, in the striatal complex the vast majority of these receptors are actually located on the other side, in other words postsynaptically. Given their strategic location, they can crucially affect signaling throughout the basal ganglia. We describe the anatomy and function of H3 receptors within the basal ganglia with a specific focus on their colocalization with dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Because the basal ganglia are centrally involved in several major neurological and psychiatric disorders, we also discuss the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting H3 receptors in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD), schizophrenia, and addiction.","Rapid signal exchange between astroglia and neurons has emerged as an essential element of neural circuits of the brain. However, the increasing variety of mechanisms contributing to this signalling appears to be facing a conceptual stalemate. The communication medium of astroglia involves intracellular [Ca(2+)] waves, which until recently have been associated with slow, global [Ca(2+)] rises. How such a uniform trigger could handle fast and diverse molecular messages remains unexplained. Recent studies have, however, revealed a variety of apparently independent Ca(2+) activities within individual astrocytic compartments, also indicating the prevalence of subcellular segregation for some signalling mechanisms. These signs of intracellular compartmentalisation might provide the key to the multitude of adaptive roles played by astroglia.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2014 Apr;37(4):189-90. Trends Neurosci. 2014 Mar;37(3):125-35.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2014 Apr;37(4):190.,"Advances in stem cell technology have engendered keen interest in cell-based therapies for neurological disorders. Postnatal engraftments of most neuronal precursors result in little cellular migration, a crucial prerequisite for transplants to integrate within the host circuitry. This may occur because most neurons migrate along substrates, such as radial glial processes, that are not abundant in adults. However, cortical GABAergic interneurons migrate tangentially from the subcortical forebrain into the cerebral cortex. Accordingly, transplants of cortical interneuron precursors migrate extensively after engraftment into a variety of CNS tissues, where they can become synaptically connected with host circuitry. We review how this remarkable ability to integrate post-transplant is being applied to the development of cell-based therapies for a variety of CNS disorders.","Understanding the principles of neuronal computation that underlie our cognitive abilities is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. Microcircuits are thought to be computational units embedded in a brain-wide neuronal network. Recent progress in experimental and analytical techniques has enabled the exploration of information flow in operating microcircuits of behaving monkeys. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that crucial transformations of neuronal codes for the representation and memory retrieval of visual objects occur in cortical microcircuits. Particularly, microcircuit comparisons across cortical areas provide novel principles for object processing, in which precursor codes for object features are constructed in a lower-order area before prevalence in a higher-order area. We review recent findings on microcircuit operations in macaque temporal cortex that enable object processing, and discuss future research directions.","Histamine appears early during brain development, has been shown to regulate fetal and adult brain-derived stem cells in a receptor type-dependent manner, and has widespread actions on systems involved in arousal and movement. Developmental studies in both rodents and zebrafish have elucidated the spatiotemporal patterning of the histaminergic system and, in zebrafish, have revealed the mechanisms whereby histamine regulates the number of hypocretin/orexin (hcrt) neurons, which in turn may regulate the number of histaminergic cells. Recent demonstrations of increased numbers of histaminergic neurons in patients with narcolepsy highlight the importance, for our understanding of both normal and pathological brain function, of understanding these interactions. Here, we review recent research into the developmental roles of histamine and suggest key areas for future research.","The unitary firing fields of hippocampal place cells are commonly assumed to be generated by input from entorhinal grid cell modules with differing spatial scales. Here, we review recent research that brings this assumption into doubt. Instead, we propose that place cell spatial firing patterns are determined by environmental sensory inputs, including those representing the distance and direction to environmental boundaries, while grid cells provide a complementary self-motion related input that contributes to maintaining place cell firing. In this view, grid and place cell firing patterns are not successive stages of a processing hierarchy, but complementary and interacting representations that work in combination to support the reliable coding of large-scale space.","Chronic pain is associated with abnormal excitability of the somatosensory system and remains poorly treated in the clinic. Potassium (K⁺) channels are crucial determinants of neuronal activity throughout the nervous system. Opening of these channels facilitates a hyperpolarizing K⁺ efflux across the plasma membrane that counteracts inward ion conductance and therefore limits neuronal excitability. Accumulating research has highlighted a prominent involvement of K⁺ channels in nociceptive processing, particularly in determining peripheral hyperexcitability. We review salient findings from expression, pharmacological, and genetic studies that have untangled a hitherto undervalued contribution of K⁺ channels in maladaptive pain signaling. These emerging data provide a framework to explain enigmatic pain syndromes and to design novel pharmacological treatments for these debilitating states.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2014 Apr;37(4):190. Trends Neurosci. 2014 Apr;37(4):189-90.,"The past decade has seen an explosion of DNA sequencing activities and many mutations and genetic variances underlying neurological and neurodegenerative diseases have been determined. This wealth of genetic data is now placed in molecular pathways revealing the nodes that underlie the disrupted processes. Many mutations in neurological diseases affect proteins controlling endosomal/lysosomal transport. Although the age of onset of these diseases range from juvenile [i.e., Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease] to late onset (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease), deregulation of endosomal transport is a common theme. This review summarizes how elucidating the genetic basis for the various neurological diseases has advanced our understanding of the endo-lysosomal system and why the various mutations all translate into similar disease phenotypes.","The neuroscience research landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. Specifically, an impressive array of new tools and technologies have been generated, including but not limited to: brain gene expression atlases, genetically encoded proteins to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity, and new methods for imaging and mapping circuits. However, despite these technological advances, several significant challenges must be overcome to enable a better understanding of brain function and to develop cell type-targeted therapeutics to treat brain disorders. This review provides an overview of some of the tools and technologies currently being used to advance the field of molecular neuroanatomy, and also discusses emerging technologies that may enable neuroscientists to address these crucial scientific challenges over the coming decade.","Disrupted salience processing is proposed as central in linking dysregulated dopamine function with psychotic symptoms. Several strands of evidence are now converging in support of this model. Animal studies show that midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by unexpected salient events. In psychotic patients, neurochemical studies have confirmed subcortical striatal dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of salience tasks have located alterations in prefrontal and striatal dopaminergic projection fields. At the clinical level, this may account for the altered sense of meaning and significance that predates the onset of psychosis. This review draws these different strands of evidence together in support of an emerging understanding of how dopamine dysregulation may lead to aberrant salience and psychotic symptoms.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are neurodevelopmental disorders with large genetic components, but identification of pathogenic genes has proceeded slowly because hundreds of loci are involved. New exome sequencing technology has identified novel rare variants and has found that sporadic cases of ASD/ID are enriched for disruptive de novo mutations. Targeted large-scale resequencing studies have confirmed the significance of specific loci, including chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (CHD8), sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, alpha subunit (SCN2A), dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), and catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88 kDa (CTNNB1, beta-catenin). We review recent studies and suggest that they have led to a convergence on three functional pathways: (i) chromatin remodeling; (ii) wnt signaling during development; and (iii) synaptic function. These pathways and genes significantly expand the neurobiological targets for study, and suggest a path for future genetic and functional studies.","With advancing age, the ability of humans to detect and discriminate odors declines. In light of the rapid progress in analyzing molecular and structural correlates of developing and adult olfactory systems, the paucity of information available on the aged olfactory system is startling. A rich literature documents the decline of olfactory acuity in aged humans, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Using animal models, preliminary work is beginning to uncover differences between young and aged rodents that may help address the deficits seen in humans, but many questions remain unanswered. Recent studies of odorant receptor (OR) expression, synaptic organization, adult neurogenesis, and the contribution of cortical representation during aging suggest possible underlying mechanisms and new research directions.","Epilepsy refers to a cluster of neurological diseases characterized by seizures. Although many forms of epilepsy have a well-defined immune etiology, in other forms of epilepsy an altered immune response is only suspected. In general, the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to seizures is supported by experimental results. Additionally, antiepileptic maneuvers may act as immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory therapies can treat seizures. Triggers of seizure include a bidirectional communication between the nervous system and organs of immunity. Thus, a crucial cellular interface protecting from immunological seizures is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we summarize recent advances in the understanding and treatment of epileptic seizures that derive from a non-neurocentric viewpoint and suggest key avenues for future research.","Revealing the engram is one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. Many researchers focus on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of the engram, but an underutilized approach has been to investigate analogous processes associated with forgetting. Infant rodents present an ideal model for this purpose because they display a rapid form of non-pathological forgetting known as infantile amnesia (IA). Despite the widespread importance of this interesting phenomenon, the study of the neural bases of IA has remained largely neglected. Here, we consider what IA can tell us about memory. We argue that to understand the mechanisms underlying the engram we must also gain an appreciation of the mechanisms that drive forgetting.","Light is a potent stimulus for regulating circadian, hormonal, and behavioral systems. In addition, light therapy is effective for certain affective disorders, sleep problems, and circadian rhythm disruption. These biological and behavioral effects of light are influenced by a distinct photoreceptor in the eye, melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), in addition to conventional rods and cones. We summarize the neurophysiology of this newly described sensory pathway and consider implications for the measurement, production, and application of light. A new light-measurement strategy taking account of the complex photoreceptive inputs to these non-visual responses is proposed for use by researchers, and simple suggestions for artificial/architectural lighting are provided for regulatory authorities, lighting manufacturers, designers, and engineers.","G protein-dependent signaling pathways control the activity of excitable cells of the nervous system and heart, and are the targets of neurotransmitters, clinically relevant drugs, and drugs of abuse. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (K(+)) (Girk/Kir3) channels are a key effector in inhibitory signaling pathways. Girk-dependent signaling contributes to nociception and analgesia, reward-related behavior, mood, cognition, and heart-rate regulation, and has been linked to epilepsy, Down syndrome, addiction, and arrhythmias. We discuss recent advances in our understanding of Girk channel structure, organization in signaling complexes, and plasticity, as well as progress on the development of subunit-selective Girk modulators. These findings offer new hope for the selective manipulation of Girk channels to treat a variety of debilitating afflictions.","Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are compounds that have a structural role in the nervous system and are essential for neurodevelopment. Results obtained with docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid show therapeutic potential in neurotrauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to major disability and have a significant socioeconomic cost. Thus, there is an unmet need for acute neuroprotection and for treatments that promote neuroregeneration. Acute administration of omega-3 PUFAs after injury and dietary exposure before or after injury improve neurological outcomes in experimental SCI and TBI. The mechanisms involved include decreased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, neurotrophic support, and activation of cell survival pathways. This review raises questions that must be addressed before successful clinical translation.","The exact nature and pathophysiology of fatigue remain largely elusive despite its high prevalence in physically ill patients. Studies on the relationship between the immune system and the central nervous system provide a new perspective on the mechanisms of fatigue. Inflammatory mediators that are released by activated innate immune cells at the periphery and in the central nervous system alter the metabolism and activity of neurotransmitters, generate neurotoxic compounds, decrease neurotrophic factors, and profoundly disturb the neuronal environment. The resulting alterations in fronto-striatal networks together with the activation of insula by inflammatory interoceptive stimuli underlie the many dimensions of fatigue including reduced incentive motivation, decreased behavioral flexibility, uncertainty about usefulness of actions, and awareness of fatigue.","Sleep is strongly involved in memory consolidation, but its role remains unclear. 'Sleep replay', the active potentiation of relevant synaptic connections via reactivation of patterns of network activity that occurred during previous experience, has received considerable attention. Alternatively, sleep has been suggested to regulate synaptic weights homeostatically and nonspecifically, thereby improving the signal:noise ratio of memory traces. Here, we reconcile these theories by highlighting the distinction between light and deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Specifically, we draw on recent studies to suggest a link between light NREM and active potentiation, and between deep NREM and homeostatic regulation. This framework could serve as a key for interpreting the physiology of sleep stages and reconciling inconsistencies in terminology in this field.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2014 Apr;37(4):243.,"The basal ganglia (BG)-recipient thalamus controls motor output but it remains unclear how its activity is regulated. Several studies report that thalamic activation occurs via disinhibition during pauses in the firing of inhibitory pallidal inputs from the BG. Other studies indicate that thalamic spiking is triggered by pallidal inputs via post-inhibitory 'rebound' calcium spikes. Finally excitatory cortical inputs can drive thalamic activity, which becomes entrained, or time-locked, to pallidal spikes. We present a unifying framework where these seemingly distinct results arise from a continuum of thalamic firing 'modes' controlled by excitatory inputs. We provide a mechanistic explanation for paradoxical pallidothalamic coactivations observed during behavior that raises new questions about what information is integrated in the thalamus to control behavior.","The agranular architecture of motor cortex lacks a functional interpretation. Here, we consider a 'predictive coding' account of this unique feature based on asymmetries in hierarchical cortical connections. In sensory cortex, layer 4 (the granular layer) is the target of ascending pathways. We theorise that the operation of predictive coding in the motor system (a process termed 'active inference') provides a principled rationale for the apparent recession of the ascending pathway in motor cortex. The extension of this theory to interlaminar circuitry also accounts for a sub-class of 'mirror neuron' in motor cortex--whose activity is suppressed when observing an action--explaining how predictive coding can gate hierarchical processing to switch between perception and action.","Primary dystonia is a poorly understood but common movement disorder. Recently, several new primary dystonia genes were identified that provide new insight into dystonia pathogenesis. The GNAL dystonia gene is central for striatal responses to dopamine (DA) and is a component of a molecular pathway already implicated in DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD). Furthermore, this pathway is also dysfunctional and pathogenically linked to mTOR signaling in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID). These new data suggest that striatal DA responses are central to primary dystonia, even when symptoms do not benefit from DA therapies. Here we integrate these new findings with current understanding of striatal microcircuitry and other dystonia-causing insults to develop new ideas on the pathophysiology of this incapacitating movement disorder.","The K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 establishes the low intraneuronal Cl- levels required for the hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials mediated by ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) and glycine receptors (GlyRs). Decreased KCC2-mediated Cl- extrusion and impaired hyperpolarizing GABAAR- and/or GlyR-mediated currents have been implicated in epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and spasticity. Recent evidence suggests that the intrinsic ion transport rate, cell surface stability, and plasmalemmal trafficking of KCC2 are rapidly and reversibly modulated by the (de)phosphorylation of critical serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in the C terminus of this protein. Alterations in KCC2 phosphorylation have been associated with impaired KCC2 function in several neurological diseases. Targeting KCC2 phosphorylation directly or indirectly via upstream regulatory kinases might be a novel strategy to modulate GABA- and/or glycinergic signaling for therapeutic benefit.","Intellectual disability is characterized by significantly impaired cognitive abilities and is due to various etiological factors, including both genetic and non-genetic causes. Two of the most common genetic forms of intellectual disability are Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). Recent studies have shown that proteins altered in FXS and DS can physically interact and participate in common signaling pathways regulating dendritic spine development and local protein synthesis, thus supporting the notion that spine dysmorphogenesis and abnormal local protein synthesis may be molecular underpinnings of intellectual disability. Here we review the molecular constituents regulating local protein synthesis and spine morphology and their alterations in FXS and DS. We argue that these changes might ultimately affect synaptic homeostasis and alter cognitive performance.","Cytoplasmic dynein is the main retrograde motor in all eukaryotic cells. This complex comprises different subunits assembled on a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 1 (DYNC1H1) dimer. Cytoplasmic dynein is particularly important for neurons because it carries essential signals and organelles from distal sites to the cell body. In the past decade, several mouse models have helped to dissect the numerous functions of DYNC1H1. Additionally, several DYNC1H1 mutations have recently been found in human patients that give rise to a broad spectrum of developmental and midlife-onset disorders. Here, we discuss the effects of mutations of mouse and human DYNC1H1 and how these studies are giving us new insight into the many critical roles DYNC1H1 plays in the nervous system.","Body-fluid homeostasis is essential to life, and the concentration of Na(+) ([Na(+)]) and osmolality in plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are continuously monitored in the brain. To maintain a physiological level of Na/osmolality in body fluids, the control of Na and water intake and excretion are of prime importance. Two independent sensing systems for [Na(+)] and osmolality in circumventricular organs (CVOs) have long been postulated to be involved in the monitoring of body-fluid conditions. In the past decade, several molecules were reported as promising candidates for these sensors - Nax for the [Na(+)] sensor and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels for the osmosensor. This review presents a summary of developments in these areas over recent years.","Rhodopsins (Rh) are G protein-coupled receptors that function as light-sensors in photoreceptors. In humans, Rh mutations cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative disease that ultimately results in blindness. Studies in Drosophila have provided many insights into basic Rh biology and have identified pathways that lead to retinal degeneration. It has been shown that, because Rh is very abundant in photoreceptors, its accumulation in numerous organelles induces severe stress and results in degeneration of these cells. Moreover, genetic lesions that affect proper activation of membrane-bound Rh lead to disruption in Ca(2+) homeostasis which also causes photoreceptor degeneration. We review here the molecular signals involved in Rh homeostasis and the mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration in flies, and discuss possible links to human diseases.","Early-life stress lastingly affects adult cognition and increases vulnerability to psychopathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this Opinion article, we propose that early nutritional input together with stress hormones and sensory stimuli from the mother during the perinatal period act synergistically to program the adult brain, possibly via epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesize that stress during gestation or lactation affects the intake of macro- and micronutrients, including dietary methyl donors, and/or impairs the dam's metabolism, thereby altering nutrient composition and intake by the offspring. In turn, this may persistently modulate gene expression via epigenetic programming, thus altering hippocampal structure and cognition. Understanding how the combination of stress, nutrition, and epigenetics shapes the adult brain is essential for effective therapies.","It is becoming clear that nervous system development and adult functioning are highly coupled with other physiological systems. Accordingly, neurological and psychiatric disorders are increasingly being associated with a range of systemic comorbidities including, most prominently, impairments in immunological and bioenergetic parameters as well as in the gut microbiome. Here, we discuss various aspects of the dynamic crosstalk between these systems that underlies nervous system development, homeostasis, and plasticity. We believe a better definition of this underappreciated systems physiology will yield important insights into how nervous system diseases with systemic comorbidities arise and potentially identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Proper brain function requires neuronal homeostasis over a range of environmental challenges. Neuronal activity, injury, and aging stress the nervous system, and lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Nevertheless, most organisms maintain healthy neurons throughout life, implying the existence of active maintenance mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed a key neuronal maintenance and protective function for nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs). We review evidence that NMNATs protect neurons through multiple mechanisms in different contexts, and highlight functions that either require or are independent of NMNAT catalytic activity. We then summarize data supporting a role for NMNATs in neuronal maintenance and raise intriguing questions on how NMNATs preserve neuronal integrity and facilitate proper neural function throughout life.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2013.09.002 PMID: 24063849  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"The 2013 Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize was awarded to Ernst Bamberg, Edward Boyden, Karl Deisseroth, Peter Hegemann, Gero Miesenböck, and Georg Nagel 'for their invention and refinement of optogenetics'. Why optogenetics? And why this sextet? To appreciate why, we turn first to some of the core questions of neuroscience and the technical difficulties that long obstructed their resolution.","The mammalian brain depends upon glucose as its main source of energy, and tight regulation of glucose metabolism is critical for brain physiology. Consistent with its critical role for physiological brain function, disruption of normal glucose metabolism as well as its interdependence with cell death pathways forms the pathophysiological basis for many brain disorders. Here, we review recent advances in understanding how glucose metabolism sustains basic brain physiology. We synthesize these findings to form a comprehensive picture of the cooperation required between different systems and cell types, and the specific breakdowns in this cooperation that lead to disease.","Voltage-gated calcium ion (CaV) channels convert neuronal activity into rapid intracellular calcium signals to trigger a myriad of cellular responses. Their involvement in major neurological and psychiatric diseases, and importance as therapeutic targets, has propelled interest in subcellular-specific mechanisms that align CaV channel activity to specific tasks. Here, we highlight recent studies that delineate mechanisms controlling the expression of CaV channels at the level of RNA and protein. We discuss the roles of RNA editing and alternative pre-mRNA splicing in generating CaV channel isoforms with activities specific to the demands of individual cells; the roles of ubiquitination and accessory proteins in regulating CaV channel expression; and the specific binding partners that contribute to both pre- and postsynaptic CaV channel function.","The human brain comprises approximately 100 billion neurons that express a diverse, and often subtype-specific, set of neurotransmitters and voltage-gated ion channels. Given this enormous complexity, a fundamental question is how is this achieved? The acquisition of neurotransmitter phenotype was viewed as being set by developmental programs 'hard wired' into the genome. By contrast, the expression of neuron-specific ion channels was considered to be highly dynamic (i.e., 'soft wired') and shaped largely by activity-dependent mechanisms. Recent evidence blurs this distinction by showing that neurotransmitter phenotype can be altered by activity and that neuron type-specific ion channel expression can be set, and perhaps limited by, developmental programs. Better understanding of these early regulatory mechanisms may offer new avenues to avert the behavioral changes that are characteristic of many mental illnesses.","Neural networks provide candidate substrates for the spread of proteinopathies causing neurodegeneration, and emerging data suggest that macroscopic signatures of network disintegration differentiate diseases. However, how do protein abnormalities produce network signatures? The answer may lie with 'molecular nexopathies': specific, coherent conjunctions of pathogenic protein and intrinsic network characteristics that define network signatures of neurodegenerative pathologies. Key features of the paradigm that we propose here include differential intrinsic network vulnerability to propagating protein abnormalities, in part reflecting developmental structural and functional factors; differential vulnerability of neural connection types (e.g., clustered versus distributed connections) to particular pathogenic proteins; and differential impact of molecular effects (e.g., toxic-gain-of-function versus loss-of-function) on gradients of network damage. The paradigm has implications for understanding and predicting neurodegenerative disease biology.","Neuronal networks confront researchers with an overwhelming complexity of interactions between their elements. A common approach to understanding neuronal processing is to reduce complexity by defining subunits and infer their functional role by selectively modulating them. However, this seemingly straightforward approach may lead to confusing results if the network exhibits parallel pathways leading to recurrent connectivity. We demonstrate limits of the selective modulation approach and argue that, even though highly successful in some instances, the approach fails in networks with complex connectivity. We argue to refine experimental techniques by carefully considering the structural features of the neuronal networks involved. Such methods could dramatically increase the effectiveness of selective modulation and may lead to a mechanistic understanding of principles underlying brain function.","In the past, attempts to create a hierarchical classification of brain structures (an ontology) have been limited by the lack of adequate data on developmental processes. Recent studies on gene expression during brain development have demonstrated the true morphologic interrelations of different parts of the brain. A developmental ontology takes into account the progressive rostrocaudal and dorsoventral differentiation of the neural tube, and the radial migration of derivatives from progenitor areas, using fate mapping and other experimental techniques. In this review, we used the prosomeric model of brain development to build a hierarchical classification of brain structures based chiefly on gene expression. Because genomic control of neural morphogenesis is remarkably conservative, this ontology should prove essentially valid for all vertebrates, aiding terminological unification.","For several decades, the dopamine precursor levodopa has been the primary therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, not all of the motor and non-motor features of PD can be attributed solely to dopaminergic dysfunction. Recent clinical and preclinical advances provide a basis for the identification of additional innovative therapeutic options to improve the management of the disease. Novel pharmacological strategies must be optimized for PD by: (i) targeting disturbances of the serotonergic, noradrenergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems in addition to the dopaminergic system, and (ii) characterizing alterations in the levels of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters that are associated with the various manifestations of the disease.","Mast cells (MCs) are both sensors and effectors in communication among nervous, vascular, and immune systems. In the brain, they reside on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and interact with neurons, glia, blood vessels, and other hematopoietic cells via their neuroactive prestored and newly synthesized chemicals. They are first responders, acting as catalysts and recruiters to initiate, amplify, and prolong other immune and nervous responses upon activation. MCs both promote deleterious outcomes in brain function and contribute to normative behavioral functioning, particularly cognition and emotionality. New experimental tools enabling isolation of brain MCs, manipulation of MCs or their products, and measurement of MC products in very small brain volumes present unprecedented opportunities for examining these enigmatic cells.","Synapse development requires differentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites and postsynaptic receptive apparatus coordinated by synapse organizing proteins. In addition to the well-characterized neurexins, recent studies identified presynaptic type IIa receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) as mediators of presynaptic differentiation and triggers of postsynaptic differentiation, thus extending the roles of RPTPs from axon outgrowth and guidance. Similarly to neurexins, RPTPs exist in multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing that interact in a splice-selective code with diverse postsynaptic partners. The parallel RPTP and neurexin hub design facilitates synapse self-assembly through cooperation, pairs presynaptic similarity with postsynaptic diversity, and balances excitation with inhibition. Upon mutation of individual genes in neuropsychiatric disorders, imbalance of this synaptic organizing network may contribute to impaired cognitive function.","In recent years, a greater understanding has emerged of the role epigenetic mechanisms play in the brain, not only during development, but also in mature neurons involved in long-term memory. The identification of spatially and temporally tuned epigenetic modification of genetic loci during memory storage has revealed the remarkably input-responsive, target-specific, and long-term nature of epigenetic regulation, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. New insight into these mechanisms has come from the study of small RNAs, which have emerged as regulators that can confer sequence specificity to DNA- and chromatin-modifying processes. We discuss advances in the elucidation of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in long-term memory, focusing on the role of small RNAs, and in particular piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in the epigenetic regulation underlying memory storage.","Neurons within the central nervous system receive humoral and central (neurotransmitter or neuropeptide) signals that ultimately regulate ingestive behavior and metabolism. Recent advances in mouse genetics combined with neuroanatomical and electrophysiological techniques have contributed to a better understanding of these central mechanisms. This review integrates recently defined cellular mechanisms and neural circuits relevant to the regulation of feeding behavior, energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis by metabolic signals.","The hippocampus is thought to automatically encode all experience, yet the vast majority of our experiences are not remembered later. Although psychological theories have postulated the existence of decay processes for declarative memory, the corresponding neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Here we develop the hypothesis that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis represents a decay process that continually clears memories from the hippocampus. As newborn granule cells integrate into established hippocampal circuits, they form new input and output connections over the course of several weeks. Because successful memory retrieval relies on reinvoking patterns of activity that occurred at the time of encoding (pattern completion), neurogenesis-induced remodeling of hippocampal circuits incrementally reduces the likelihood that a given retrieval cue will reinvoke a previously stored pattern.","Although signs of empathy have now been well documented in non-human primates, only during the past few years have systematic observations suggested that a primal form of empathy exists in rodents. Thus, the study of empathy in animals has started in earnest. Here we review recent studies indicating that rodents are able to share states of fear, and highlight how affective neuroscience approaches to the study of primary-process emotional systems can help to delineate how primal empathy is constituted in mammalian brains. Cross-species evolutionary approaches to understanding the neural circuitry of emotional 'contagion' or 'resonance' between nearby animals, together with the underlying neurochemistries, may help to clarify the origins of human empathy.","An expanded G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat in the proximal regulatory region of C9orf72 is a frequent cause of neurodegenerative diseases in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND) spectrum. Although primarily characterized by variably abundant pathological inclusions of TDP-43 protein, the lesion load was extended to TDP-43-negative, p62-positive neuronal and glial inclusions in extended regions of the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in cerebellum, where they may be characteristic of a C9orf72 repeat expansion. Disease mechanisms associated with repeat expansion disorders, including haploinsufficiency, RNA toxicity, and abnormal translation of expanded repeat sequences, are beginning to emerge. We review genetic, clinical, and pathological highlights and discuss current insights into the biology of this novel type of repeat expansion disease.","Epigenetic mechanisms convey information above and beyond the sequence of DNA, so it is predicted that they are critical in the complex regulation of brain development and explain the long-lived effects of environmental cues on pre- and early post-natal brain development. Neurons have a complex epigenetic landscape that changes dynamically with transcriptional activity in early life. Here, we summarize progress in our understanding of the discrete layers of the dynamic methylome, chromatin proteome, noncoding RNAs, chromatin loops, and long-range interactions in neuronal development and maturation. Many neurodevelopmental disorders have genetic alterations in these epigenetic modifications or regulators, and these human genetics lessons have demonstrated the importance of these epigenetic players and the epigenetic layers that transcriptional events lay down in the early brain.","Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication affecting more than one third of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Although all cellular components participating in peripheral nerve function are exposed to and affected by the metabolic consequences of DM, nodal regions, areas of intense interactions between Schwann cells and axons, may be particularly sensitive to DM-induced alterations. Nodes are enriched in insulin receptors, glucose transporters, Na(+) and K(+) channels, and mitochondria, all implicated in the development and progression of DPN. Latest results particularly reinforce the idea that changes in ion-channel function and energy metabolism, both of which depend on axon-glia crosstalk, are among the important contributors to DPN. These insights provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches aimed at delaying or reversing DPN.","Image processing begins in the retina, where neurons respond with graded voltage changes that must be converted into spikes. This conversion from 'analog' to 'digital' coding is a fundamental transformation carried out by the visual system, but the mechanisms are still not well understood. Recent work demonstrates that, in vertebrates, graded-to-spiking conversion of the visual signal begins in the axonal system of bipolar cells (BCs), which transmit visual information through ribbon-type synapses specialized for responding to graded voltage signals. Here, we explore the evidence for and against the idea that ribbon synapses also transmit digital information. We then discuss the potential costs and benefits of digitization at different stages of visual pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates.","Retrograde signaling is a fundamental means by which neurons communicate. The acceptance of this statement has required a revision of how we view transmission and storage of information at the synapse. Although there is a substantial body of literature on the diverse molecules that serve as retrograde signals, less is known about how retrograde signal capacity can be modified. Is retrograde signaling plastic? How does this plasticity manifest? Are there behavioral correlates that may bias a neuron towards 'changing its tune', retrogradely speaking, of course? Here, we review recent findings that retrograde signaling is a highly labile process that adds additional layers of complexity that must be untangled to understand information processing in the nervous system.","Astrocytes contribute to neurotransmission through a variety of mechanisms ranging from synapse isolation to active signaling. Astroglial involvement in neurophysiology has been mostly investigated at the single-cell level. However, a unique feature of astrocytes is their high level of intercellular connectivity mediated by connexins, the proteins forming gap junction (GJ) channels. These astroglial GJ circuits enable the rapid intercellular exchange of ions, metabolites, and neuroactive substances. Recent findings have suggested that, despite their extensity, astroglial networks are also selective, preferential as well as plastic, and can regulate synapses, neuronal circuits, and behavior. The present review critically discusses the impact of astroglial networks on normal and pathological neuronal information processing as well as the underlying mechanisms.","Increased understanding of the early stages of olfaction has lead to a renewed interest in the higher brain regions responsible for forming unified 'odor images' from the chemical components detected by the nose. The piriform cortex, which is one of the first cortical destinations of olfactory information in mammals, is a primitive paleocortex that is critical for the synthetic perception of odors. Here we review recent work that examines the cellular neurophysiology of the piriform cortex. Exciting new findings have revealed how the neurons and circuits of the piriform cortex process odor information, demonstrating that, despite its superficial simplicity, the piriform cortex is a remarkably subtle and intricate neural circuit.","Degeneration of axons and dendrites is a common and early pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, and is thought to be regulated by mechanisms distinct from those determining death of the cell body. The unique structures of axons and dendrites (collectively neurites) may cause them to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Autophagy is a catabolic mechanism in which cells clear protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Basal autophagy occurs continuously as a housekeeping function, and can be acutely expanded in response to stress or injury. Emerging evidence shows that insufficient or excessive autophagy contributes to neuritic degeneration. Here, we review the recent progress that has begun to reveal the role of autophagy in neurite function and degeneration.","High-resolution molecular and imaging techniques are shedding light on the mechanisms and functional significance of the transient rise in tissue lactate that accompanies synaptic activity. Despite high energy needs, neurons have a truncated glycolytic pathway that favors antioxidation over energy production, whereas astrocytes team up with oligodendrocytes to extract glucose from the blood, mobilize glycogen, and release lactate under neuronal command. Lactate energizes neurons but also diffuses beyond the active zone and modifies the activity of neurons and astrocytes in neighboring regions. Involved in a hierarchy of processes from neurovascular coupling to memory formation, lactate has a dual role as metabolic fuel and an intercellular messenger.","Stability and flexibility are both hallmarks of brain function that allow animals to thrive in ever-changing environments. Investigating how a balance between these opposing features is achieved with a dynamic array of cellular and molecular constituents requires long-term tracking of activity from individual neurons. Here, we review in vivo chronic extracellular recording studies and recent long-term two-photon calcium-imaging investigations that address the question of stability and plasticity of neuronal population activity in the mammalian brain. Overall, spiking activity is heterogeneously distributed among neurons in local populations and largely remains stable for individual cells over time. Tuning properties appear more flexible and may be adaptively stabilized, possibly by neuromodulators, to encode reliably and specifically salient stimuli or behaviors.","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in older adults and ultimately leads to the death of photoreceptor cells in the macular area of the neural retina. Currently, treatments are only available for patients with the wet form of AMD. In this review, we describe recent approaches to develop cell-based therapies for the treatment of AMD. Recent research has focused on replacing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells vital to photoreceptor cell health. We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials.", ,"Growth inhibitory molecules in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) have been implicated in the blocking of axonal sprouting and regeneration following injury. Prominent CNS regeneration inhibitors include Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), and a key question concerns their physiological role in the naïve CNS. Emerging evidence suggests novel functions in dendrites and at synapses of glutamatergic neurons. CNS regeneration inhibitors target the neuronal actin cytoskeleton to regulate dendritic spine maturation, long-term synapse stability, and Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity. This is accomplished in part by antagonizing plasticity-promoting signaling pathways activated by neurotrophic factors. Altered function of CNS regeneration inhibitors is associated with mental illness and loss of long-lasting memory, suggesting unexpected and novel physiological roles for these molecules in brain health.","Since its initial conceptualisation, metaplasticity has come to encompass a wide variety of phenomena and mechanisms, creating the important challenge of understanding how they contribute to network function and behaviour. Here, we present a framework for considering potential roles of metaplasticity across three domains of function. First, metaplasticity appears ideally placed to prepare for subsequent learning by either enhancing learning ability generally or by preparing neuronal networks to encode specific content. Second, metaplasticity can homeostatically regulate synaptic plasticity, and this likely has important behavioural consequences by stabilising synaptic weights while ensuring the ongoing availability of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence that metaplasticity mechanisms may play a role in disease causally and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Pain and fear are both aversive experiences that strongly impact on behaviour and well being. They are considered protective when they lead to meaningful, adaptive behaviour such as the avoidance of situations that are potentially dangerous to the integrity of tissue (pain) or the individual (fear). Pain and fear may, however, become maladaptive if expressed under inappropriate conditions or at excessive intensities for extended durations. Currently emerging concepts of maladaptive pain and fear suggest that basic neuronal mechanisms of memory formation are relevant for the development of pathological forms of pain and fear. Thus, the processes of erasing memory traces of pain and fear may constitute promising targets for future therapies.","Once perceived as solitary structures, mitochondria are now recognized as highly dynamic, interconnected organelles. The tight control of their fusion and fission, a process termed 'mitochondrial dynamics', is crucial for neurons, given their unique architecture and special energy and calcium-buffering requirements at the synapse. Interestingly, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition initiated at the synapse, mitochondrial dynamics are severely impaired. Of the two proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) and TAU, only the impact of Aβ on mitochondrial dynamics has been studied in detail. We highlight recent findings that TAU exerts a determinative effect in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, and therefore neuronal function. In this process, the GTPase DRP1 has emerged as a key target of both Aβ and TAU.","Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are essential for controlling key functions of the brain, such as voluntary movement, reward processing, and working memory. The largest populations of midbrain DA neurons are localized in two neighboring nuclei, the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Regardless of their different axonal projections to subcortical and cortical targets, midbrain DA neurons have traditionally been regarded as a relatively homogeneous group of neurons, with a stereotypical set of intrinsic electrophysiological properties and in vivo pattern of activity. In this review, I highlight recent data supporting an unexpected degree of diversity among these midbrain DA neurons in the mammalian brain, ranging from their developmental lineages and different synaptic connectivity to their electrophysiological properties and behavioral functions.","Accumulating evidence shows that T cells penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma in several autoimmune, infectious, and degenerative neurological diseases. The structural and functional consequences for CNS neurons of their encounter with activated T cells have been investigated in several experimental systems, including ex vivo co-cultures, electrophysiology, and in vivo imaging. Here, we review the modalities of neuron/T cell interactions. We substantiate the contention that T cells are directly responsible for neuronal damage in a large number of neurological diseases and discuss mechanisms of neuronal damage mediated by distinct T cell subsets, the impact of which differs depending on the disease. Finally, we describe how a better understanding of the mechanisms at play offers new possibilities for therapeutic intervention.","Resting-state networks (RSNs), which have become a main focus in neuroimaging research, can be best simulated by large-scale cortical models in which networks teeter on the edge of instability. In this state, the functional networks are in a low firing stable state while they are continuously pulled towards multiple other configurations. Small extrinsic perturbations can shape task-related network dynamics, whereas perturbations from intrinsic noise generate excursions reflecting the range of available functional networks. This is particularly advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes the vital interplay of time and space. In this article, we propose a new theoretical framework for RSNs that can serve as a fertile ground for empirical testing.","Growing axons are exposed to various guidance cues en route to their targets. Although many guidance molecules have been identified and their effects on axon behavior extensively studied, how axons react to combinations of signals remains largely unexplored. We review recent studies investigating the combined actions of guidance cues present at the same choice points. Two main scenarios are emerging from these studies: parallel signaling and crosstalk between guidance systems. In the first case, cues act in an additive manner, whereas in the second case the outcome is non-additive and differs from the sum of individual effects, suggesting more complex signal integration in the growth cone. Some of the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are beginning to be unraveled.","Cortical folding is a hallmark of many, but not all, mammalian brains. The degree of folding increases with brain size across mammals, but at different scales between orders and families. In this review we summarize recent studies that have shed light on cortical folding and discuss new models that arise from these data. Genetic analyses argue for an independent development of brain volume and gyrification, but more recent data on the cellular development of the cortex and its connectivity highlight the role of these processes in cortical folding (grey matter hypothesis). This, and the widely discussed tension hypothesis, further tested by analyzing the mechanical properties of maturing nerve fibers, synapses, and dendrites, can provide the basis for a future integrative view on cortical folding.","Within the first few days of life, humans are colonized by commensal intestinal microbiota. Here, we review recent findings showing that microbiota are important in normal healthy brain function. We also discuss the relation between stress and microbiota, and how alterations in microbiota influence stress-related behaviors. New studies show that bacteria, including commensal, probiotic, and pathogenic bacteria, in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can activate neural pathways and central nervous system (CNS) signaling systems. Ongoing and future animal and clinical studies aimed at understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis may provide novel approaches for prevention and treatment of mental illness, including anxiety and depression.","Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel experiences.","Insects possess miniature brains but exhibit a sophisticated behavioral repertoire. Recent studies have reported the existence of unsuspected cognitive capabilities in various insect species that go beyond the traditionally studied framework of simple associative learning. Here, I focus on capabilities such as attentional modulation and concept learning and discuss their mechanistic bases. I analyze whether these behaviors, which appear particularly complex, can be explained on the basis of elemental associative learning and specific neural circuitries or, by contrast, require an explanatory level that goes beyond simple associative links. In doing this, I highlight experimental challenges and suggest future directions for investigating the neurobiology of higher-order learning in insects, with the goal of uncovering the basic neural architectures underlying cognitive processing.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2012.12.006 PMID: 23375784  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Recent studies have revealed that E3 ubiquitin ligases have essential functions in the establishment of neuronal circuits. Strikingly, a common emerging theme in these studies is that spatial organization of E3 ubiquitin ligases plays a critical role in the control of neuronal morphology and connectivity. E3 ubiquitin ligases localize to the nucleus, centrosome, Golgi apparatus, axon and dendrite cytoskeleton, and synapses in neurons. Localization of ubiquitin ligases within distinct subcellular compartments may facilitate neuronal responses to extrinsic cues and the ubiquitination of local substrates. Here, we review the functions of neuronal E3 ubiquitin ligases at distinct subcellular locales and explore how they regulate neuronal morphology and function in the nervous system.","It is widely accepted that Hebbian forms of plasticity mediate selective modifications in synaptic strength underlying information encoding in response to experience and circuit formation or refinement throughout development. Several complementary forms of homeostatic plasticity coordinate to keep Hebbian plasticity in check, frequently through the actions of conserved regulatory molecules. Recent evidence suggests that this may be the case for adenosine, which is ubiquitous in the brain and is released by both neurons and glial cells via constitutive and activity-dependent mechanisms. Through A1 and A2A receptor activation, adenosine modulates neuronal homeostasis and tunes the ability of synapses to undergo and/or sustain plasticity. Here, we review how adenosine equilibrates neuronal activity and sets the stage for synaptic plasticity.","Cognitive dysfunction, including significant impairments in learning, behavior, and attention, is found in over 10% of children in the general population. However, in the common inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the prevalence of these cognitive deficits approaches 70%. As a monogenic disorder, NF1 provides a unique genetic tool to identify and dissect mechanistically the molecular and cellular bases underlying cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we discuss Nf1 fly and mouse systems that mimic many of the cognitive abnormalities seen in children with NF1. Further, we describe discoveries from these models that have uncovered defects in the regulation of Ras activity, cAMP generation, and dopamine homeostasis as key mechanisms important for cognitive dysfunction in children with NF1.","The traditional role of microglia has been in brain infection and disease, phagocytosing debris and secreting factors to modify disease progression. Recent evidence extends their role to healthy brain homeostasis, including the regulation of cell death, synapse elimination, neurogenesis, and neuronal surveillance. These actions contribute to the maturation and plasticity of neural circuits that ultimately shape behavior. Here we review microglial contributions to the development, plasticity, and maintenance of neural circuits with a focus on interactions with synapses. We introduce this topic by reviewing recent studies on the migration and proliferation of microglia within the brain, and conclude with the proposal that microglia dysfunction may adversely affect brain function, and thereby contribute to the development of psychiatric and neurological disorders.","In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), coupling of neurons by gap junctions (i.e., electrical synapses) and the expression of the neuronal gap junction protein, connexin 36 (Cx36), transiently increase during early postnatal development. The levels of both subsequently decline and remain low in the adult, confined to specific subsets of neurons. However, following neuronal injury [such as ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and epilepsy], the coupling and expression of Cx36 rise. Here we summarize new findings on the mechanisms of regulation of Cx36-containing gap junctions in the developing and mature CNS and following injury. We also review recent studies suggesting various roles for neuronal gap junctions and in particular their role in glutamate-mediated neuronal death.","Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures due to hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony of brain neurons. Current theories of pathophysiology stress neuronal dysfunction and damage, and aberrant connections as relevant factors. Most antiepileptic drugs target neuronal mechanisms. However, nearly one-third of patients have seizures that are refractory to available medications; a deeper understanding of mechanisms may be required to conceive more effective therapies. Recent studies point to a significant contribution by non-neuronal cells, the glia--especially astrocytes and microglia--in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. This review critically evaluates the role of glia-induced hyperexcitability and inflammation in epilepsy.","A basic feature of intelligent systems such as the cerebral cortex is the ability to freely associate aspects of perceived experience with an internal representation of the world and make predictions about the future. Here, a hypothesis is presented that the extraordinary performance of the cortex derives from an associative mechanism built in at the cellular level to the basic cortical neuronal unit: the pyramidal cell. The mechanism is robustly triggered by coincident input to opposite poles of the neuron, is exquisitely matched to the large- and fine-scale architecture of the cortex, and is tightly controlled by local microcircuits of inhibitory neurons targeting subcellular compartments. This article explores the experimental evidence and the implications for how the cortex operates.","Breathing movements in mammals are driven by rhythmic neural activity generated within spatially and functionally organized brainstem neural circuits comprising the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG). This rhythmic activity provides homeostatic regulation of gases in blood and tissues and integrates breathing with other motor acts. We review new insights into the spatial-functional organization of key neural microcircuits of this CPG from recent multidisciplinary experimental and computational studies. The emerging view is that the microcircuit organization within the CPG allows the generation of multiple rhythmic breathing patterns and adaptive switching between them, depending on physiological or pathophysiological conditions. These insights open the possibility for site- and mechanism-specific interventions to treat various disorders of the neural control of breathing.","During histogenesis of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), neuronal progenitors must interact with germinal zone (GZ) niches, differentiate, and morphologically mature, and neurons must migrate to their final positions. The extrinsic cues that control neurogenesis, specify neurons, and guide their movement are relatively well understood. However, less is known about how neurons spatiotemporally modify cell-cell interactions and cell polarization to navigate through complex, distinct cellular environments during neuronal circuit formation. Here we examine the parallels between the mechanisms controlling epithelial morphogenesis and the cell adhesion events by which neural cells organize GZ niches and direct neuronal migration. We focus on the emerging relationship between neuronal adhesive interactions and conserved cell-polarity signaling cascades.","The roles of opioid receptors in pain and addiction have been extensively studied, but their function in mood disorders has received less attention. Accumulating evidence from animal research reveals that mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors (MORs, DORs and KORs, respectively) exert highly distinct controls over mood-related processes. DOR agonists and KOR antagonists have promising antidepressant potential, whereas the risk-benefit ratio of currently available MOR agonists as antidepressants remains difficult to evaluate, in addition to their inherent abuse liability. To date, both human and animal studies have mainly examined MORs in the etiology of depressive disorders, and future studies will address DOR and KOR function in established and emerging neurobiological aspects of depression, including neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and social behaviors.","Rapid information processing in our nervous system relies on high-frequency fusion of transmitter-filled vesicles at chemical synapses. Some sensory synapses possess prominent electron-dense ribbon structures that provide a scaffold for tethering synaptic vesicles at the active zone (AZ), enabling sustained vesicular release. Here, we review functional data indicating that some central and neuromuscular synapses can also sustain vesicle-fusion rates that are comparable to those of ribbon-type sensory synapses. Comparison of the ultrastructure across these different types of synapses, together with recent work showing that cytomatrix proteins can tether vesicles and speed vesicle reloading, suggests that filamentous structures may play a key role in vesicle supply. We discuss potential mechanisms by which vesicle tethering could contribute to sustained high rates of vesicle fusion across ribbon-type, central, and neuromuscular synapses.", ,"The number of obese or overweight humans continues to increase worldwide. Hypertension is a serious disease that often develops in obesity, but it is not clear how obesity increases the risk of hypertension. However, both obesity and hypertension increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we examine how obesity may increase the risk of developing hypertension. Specifically, we discuss how the adipose-derived hormone leptin influences the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), through actions in the brain to elevate energy expenditure (EE) while also contributing to hypertension in obesity.","Daily rhythms are evident across our physiology, ranging from overt behavioural patterns like sleep to intricate molecular rhythms in epigenetic coding. Driving these rhythms at an anatomical and cellular level are circadian clock networks comprising core clock genes and an ever-expanding list of clock-controlled genes. Research over the past decade has revealed an intimate relationship between the clockwork and metabolic processes. In line with this, feeding behaviour in many species exhibits a strong circadian rhythm and, when restricted, food becomes the most potent entraining stimulus for clocks of the body. Critically, there are several indications that disturbance of our daily rhythms contributes to the development of obesity and diabetes. Given our 24-h society, it is important that we understand how the circadian clock influences what and when we eat.","A considerable body of evidence links diminished brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling to energy balance dysregulation and severe obesity in humans and rodents. Because BDNF exhibits broad neurotrophic properties, the underpinnings of these effects and its true role in the central regulation of food intake remain topics of debate in the field. Here, I discuss recent evidence supporting a critical role for this neurotrophin in physiological mechanisms regulating nutrient intake and body weight in the mature brain. They include reports of functional interactions of BDNF with central anorexigenic and orexigenic signaling pathways and evidence of recognized appetite hormones exerting neurotrophic effects similar to those of BDNF.","Animals use current, past, and projected future states of the organism and the world in a finely tuned system to control ingestion. They must not only deal effectively with current nutrient deficiencies, but also manage energy resources to meet future needs, all within the constraints of the mechanisms of metabolism. Many recent approaches to understanding the control of ingestive behavior distinguish between homeostatic mechanisms concerned with energy balance, and hedonic and incentive processes based on palatability and reward characteristics of food. In this review, I consider how learning about environmental cues influences homeostatic and hedonic brain signals, which may lead to increases in the affective taste properties of food and desire to over consume. Understanding these mechanisms may be critical for elucidating the etiology of the obesity epidemic.","Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in relentless restrictive eating and often become severely emaciated. Because there are no proven treatments, AN has high rates of relapse, chronicity, and death. Those with AN tend to have childhood temperament and personality traits, such as anxiety, obsessions, and perfectionism, which may reflect neurobiological risk factors for developing AN. Restricted eating may be a means of reducing negative mood caused by skewed interactions between serotonin aversive or inhibitory and dopamine reward systems. Brain imaging studies suggest that altered eating is a consequence of dysregulated reward and/or awareness of homeostatic needs, perhaps related to enhanced executive ability to inhibit incentive motivational drives. An understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder is likely to be important for developing more effective treatments.","Tanycytes, glial-like cells that line the third ventricle, are emerging as components of the hypothalamic networks that control body weight and energy balance. They contact the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and send processes that come into close contact with neurons in the arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. Tanycytes are glucosensitive and are able to respond to transmitters associated with arousal and the drive to feed. At least some tanycytes are stem cells and, in the median eminence, may be stimulated by diet to generate new neurons. The quest is on to understand how tanycytes detect and respond to changes in energy balance and how they communicate with the rest of the nervous system to effect their functions.","The past 20 years witnessed an enormous leap in understanding of the central regulation of whole-body energy metabolism. Genetic tools have enabled identification of the region-specific expression of peripheral metabolic hormone receptors and have identified neuronal circuits that mediate the action of these hormones on behavior and peripheral tissue functions. One of the surprising findings of recent years is the observation that brain circuits involved in metabolism regulation remain plastic through adulthood. In this review, we discuss these findings and focus on the role of neurons and glial cells in the dynamic process of plasticity, which is fundamental to the regulation of physiological and pathological metabolic events.","Regulation of body weight is organized by distributed brain circuits that use a variety of neuropeptides and transmitters, and that are responsive to endocrine and metabolic signals. Targeting of these circuits with novel pharmaceutical drugs would be helpful additions to lifestyle interventions for the treatment of obesity. The recent FDA approval of two anti-obesity drugs holds promise in a field in which previous drugs were removed from clinical use because of unacceptable psychiatric and cardiovascular side effects. Here, the modes of action of anti-obesity drugs are reviewed.","Although exposure to major psychological trauma is unfortunately common, risk for related neuropsychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), varies greatly among individuals. Fear extinction offers a tractable and translatable behavioral readout of individual differences in learned recovery from trauma. Studies in rodent substrains and subpopulations are providing new insights into neural system dysfunctions associated with impaired fear extinction. Rapid progress is also being made in identifying key molecular circuits, epigenetic mechanisms, and gene variants associated with differences in fear extinction. Here, we discuss how this research is informing understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of individual differences in risk for trauma-related anxiety disorders, and how future work can help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and pharmacotherapeutics for these disorders.","A dietary therapy for pediatric epilepsy known as the ketogenic diet has seen a revival in its clinical use during the past decade. Although the underlying mechanism of the diet remains unknown, modern scientific approaches, such as the genetic disruption of glucose metabolism, are allowing for more detailed questions to be addressed. Recent work indicates that several mechanisms may exist for the ketogenic diet, including disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, inhibition of glycolysis, and activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Here, we describe on-going work in these areas that is providing a better understanding of metabolic influences on brain excitability and epilepsy.","The frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a strong and reliable synapse because, during activation, sufficient neurotransmitter is released to trigger a postsynaptic action potential (AP). Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that this reliability emerges from the assembly of thousands of unreliable single vesicle release sites. The mechanisms that govern this unreliability include a paucity of voltage-gated calcium channels, a low probability of calcium channel opening during an AP, and the rare triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion even when a calcium channel does open and allows calcium flux. Here, we discuss the evidence that these unreliable single vesicle release sites may be the fundamental building blocks of many types of synapses in both the peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS, respectively).","Cholinergic interneurons have emerged as one of the key players controlling network functions in the striatum. Extracellularly recorded cholinergic interneurons acquire characteristic responses to sensory stimuli during reward-related learning, including a pause and subsequent rebound in spiking. However, the precise underlying cellular mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of cholinergic interneuron activity. We discuss evidence of mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie sensory responses, including antagonistic actions by dopamine, recurrent inhibition via local interneurons, and an intrinsically generated membrane hyperpolarization in response to excitatory inputs. The review highlights outstanding questions and concludes with a model of the sensory responses and their downstream effects through dynamic acetylcholine receptor activation.","Despite a century of debate over the existence of adult cortical neurogenesis, a consensus has not yet been reached. Here, we review evidence of the existence, origin, migration, and integration of neurons into the adult and neonatal cerebral cortex. We find that the lack of consensus likely stems from the low rate of postnatal cortical neurogenesis that has been observed, the fact that neurogenesis may be limited to subtypes of interneurons, and variability in other conditions, both physiological and environmental. We emphasize that neurogenesis occurs in the neonatal cortex and that neural stem cells are present into adulthood; it is possible that these progenitors are dormant, but they may be reactivated, for example, following injury.","DNA methylation was once considered to be a static epigenetic modification whose primary function was restricted to directing the development of cellular phenotype. However, it is now evident that the methylome is dynamically regulated across the lifespan: during development as a putative mechanism by which early experience leaves a lasting signature on the genome and during adulthood as a function of behavioral adaptation. Here, we propose that experience-dependent variations in DNA methylation, particularly within the context of learning and memory, represent a form of genomic metaplasticity that serves to prime the transcriptional response to later learning-related stimuli and neuronal reactivation.","Sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1Rs) have been implicated in many neurological and psychiatric conditions. Sig-1Rs are intracellular chaperones that reside specifically at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrion interface, referred to as the mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM). Here, Sig-1Rs regulate ER-mitochondrion Ca(2+) signaling. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of Sig-1R functions. Based on this, we suggest that the key cellular mechanisms linking Sig-1Rs to neurological disorders involve the translocation of Sig-1Rs from the MAM to other parts of the cell, whereby Sig-1Rs bind and modulate the activities of various ion channels, receptors, or kinases. Thus, Sig-1Rs and their associated ligands may represent new avenues for treating aspects of neurological and psychiatric diseases.","The Allen Human Brain Atlas is a freely available multimodal atlas of gene expression and anatomy comprising a comprehensive 'all genes-all structures' array-based dataset of gene expression and complementary in situ hybridization (ISH) gene expression studies targeting selected genes in specific brain regions. Available via the Allen Brain Atlas data portal (www.brain-map.org), the Atlas integrates structure, function, and gene expression data to accelerate basic and clinical research of the human brain in normal and disease states.","Understanding the signals that guide neuronal development and direct formation of axons, dendrites, and synapses during wiring of the brain is a fundamental challenge in developmental neuroscience. Discovery of how local signals shape developing neurons has been impeded by the inability of conventional culture methods to interrogate microenvironments of complex neuronal cytoarchitectures, where different subdomains encounter distinct chemical, physical, and fluidic features. Microfabrication techniques are facilitating the creation of microenvironments tailored to neuronal structures and subdomains with unprecedented access and control. The design, fabrication, and properties of microfluidic devices offer significant advantages for addressing unresolved issues of neuronal development. These high-resolution approaches are poised to contribute new insights into mechanisms for restoring neuronal function and connectivity compromised by injury, stress, and neurodegeneration.","A large body of evidence suggests that neural plasticity contributes to learning and disease. Recent studies suggest that cortical map plasticity is typically a transient phase that improves learning by increasing the pool of task-relevant responses. Here, I discuss a new perspective on neural plasticity and suggest how plasticity might be targeted to reset dysfunctional circuits. Specifically, a new model is proposed in which map expansion provides a form of replication with variation that supports a Darwinian mechanism to select the most behaviorally useful circuits. Precisely targeted neural plasticity provides a new avenue for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders and is a powerful tool to test the neural mechanisms of learning and memory.","Maladaptive responses to stress and the associated hypersecretion of glucocorticoids cause psychopathologies ranging from hyperemotional states and mood dysfunction to cognitive impairments. Research in both humans and animal models has begun to identify morphological correlates of these functional changes. These include dendritic and synaptic reorganization, glial remodeling, and altered cell fate in cortical and subcortical structures. The emerging view is that stress induces a 'disconnection syndrome' whereby the transmission and integration of information that are critical for orchestrating appropriate physiological and behavioral responses are perturbed. High-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of the complete neural circuitry and identification of the cellular processes impacted by stress will help to advance discovery of strategies to reduce or reverse the burden of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.","In the central nervous system (CNS) the function of retinoic acid, the active metabolite of vitamin A, is best understood from its action in guiding embryonic development; as development comes to completion, retinoic acid signaling declines. However, it is increasingly recognized that this signaling mechanism does not disappear in the adult brain but becomes more regionally focused and takes on new roles. These functions are often tied to processes of neural plasticity whether in the hippocampus, through homeostatic neural plasticity, the olfactory bulb or the hypothalamus. The role of retinoic acid in the control of plastic processes has led to suggestions of its involvement in neural disorders, both degenerative and psychiatric. This review presents a snapshot of developments in these areas over recent years.","The basal ganglia (BG) are involved in motor function, habit formation, and reward or addictive behaviors, but the question as to how the BG integrate arousal with these fundamental striatal functions has only recently received much attention. Findings based on electrophysiology, neurotoxic lesioning, and the use of transgenic animals have established that the striatum and globus pallidus are key structural elements for the control of sleep and wakefulness. Here, we discuss emerging anatomical and molecular mechanisms of sleep-wake regulation at work in the BG. Furthermore, we propose a model whereby adenosine and dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are involved in the integration of behavioral processes and the induction of wakefulness through cortical activation.","Many regeneration contexts require the presence of regenerating nerves as a transient component of the progenitor cell niche. Here we review nerve involvement in regeneration of various structures in vertebrates and invertebrates. Nerves are also implicated as persistent determinants in the niche of certain stem cells in mammals, as well as in Drosophila. We consider our present understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve dependence, including evidence of critical interactions with glia and non-neural cell types. The example of the salamander aneurogenic limb illustrates that developmental interactions between the limb bud and its innervation can be determinative for adult regeneration. These phenomena provide a different perspective on nerve cells to that based on chemical and electrical excitability.","Oxytocin and vasopressin are regulators of anxiety, stress-coping, and sociality. They are released within hypothalamic and limbic areas from dendrites, axons, and perikarya independently of, or coordinated with, secretion from neurohypophysial terminals. Central oxytocin exerts anxiolytic and antidepressive effects, whereas vasopressin tends to show anxiogenic and depressive actions. Evidence from pharmacological and genetic association studies confirms their involvement in individual variation of emotional traits extending to psychopathology. Based on their opposing effects on emotional behaviors, we propose that a balanced activity of both brain neuropeptide systems is important for appropriate emotional behaviors. Shifting the balance between the neuropeptide systems towards oxytocin, by positive social stimuli and/or psychopharmacotherapy, may help to improve emotional behaviors and reinstate mental health.","Sound is encoded at synapses between cochlear inner hair cells and the auditory nerve. These synapses are anatomically and functionally specialized to transmit acoustic information with high fidelity over a lifetime. The molecular mechanisms of hair-cell transmitter release have recently attracted substantial interest. Here we review progress toward understanding otoferlin, a multi-C2 domain protein identified a decade ago by genetic analysis of human deafness. Otoferlin functions in hair-cell exocytosis. Several otoferlin C2 domains bind to Ca2+, phospholipids, and proteins. Current research reveals requirements for otoferlin in priming and fusion of synaptic vesicles during sound encoding. Understanding the molecular mechanisms through which otoferlin functions also has important implications for understanding the disease mechanisms that lead to deafness.","Proper development of the central nervous system (CNS) requires the establishment of appropriate connections between neurons. Recent work suggests that this process is controlled by a balance between synaptogenic molecules and proteins that negatively regulate synapse formation and plasticity. Surprisingly, many of these newly identified synapse-limiting molecules are classic 'immune' proteins. In particular, major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules regulate neurite outgrowth, the establishment and function of cortical connections, activity-dependent refinement in the visual system, and long-term and homeostatic plasticity. This review summarizes our current understanding of MHCI expression and function in the CNS, as well as the potential mechanisms used by MHCI to regulate brain development and plasticity.","The tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA), also named the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), is a recently defined midbrain structure considered to exert a major inhibitory drive on dopamine systems. In view of its connectivity, tVTA is well placed to convey salient positive and negative signals to dopamine cells and participate in adaptative behavioral responses. This structure could act as a hub converging and integrating widespread multimodal signals toward dopamine systems. The tVTA participates in prediction error, motor control, and responses to aversive stimuli and drugs of abuse. In light of the crucial role of the tVTA in the opiate control of dopamine activity, a neuroanatomical update of the disinhibition model of morphine action is proposed.","Caspase-3 has been identified as a key mediator of neuronal programmed cell death. This protease plays a central role in the developing nervous system and its activation is observed early in neural tube formation and persists during postnatal differentiation of the neural network. Caspase-3 activation, a crucial event of neuronal cell death program, is also a feature of many chronic neurodegenerative diseases. This traditional apoptotic function of caspase-3 is challenged by recent studies that reveal new cell death-independent roles for mitochondrial-activated caspase-3 in neurite pruning and synaptic plasticity. These findings underscore the need for further research into the mechanism of action and functions of caspase-3 that may prove useful in the development of novel pharmacological treatments for a diverse range of neurological disorders.","The dynamic relation between stem cells and their niche governs self-renewal and progenitor cell deployment. The chemokine CXCL12 (C-X-C motif ligand 12) and its signaling receptor CXCR4 (C-X-C motif receptor 4) represent an important pathway that regulates homing and maintenance of stem cells in neural niches. Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in specific niches where communication with blood vessels is regulated by CXCL12. In neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors, reactive vasculature forms in response to diseased tissues to create new niches that secrete CXCL12, enhancing the recruitment of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to lesion sites via long-range migration. These observations suggest that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis maintains NSCs and serves as an emergent salvage signal for initiating endogenous stem cell-based tissue repair.","Emerging evidence suggests that chronic pain is a disease that can alter brain function. Imaging studies have demonstrated structural remapping and functional reorganization of brain circuits under various pain conditions. In parallel, preclinical models have demonstrated that chronic pain causes long-term neuroplasticity. For example, thalamo-cortical oscillations are dysregulated and neurons in the sensory thalamus undergo ectopic firing linked to misexpression of membrane ion channels. In theory, physiological changes at the single-unit, multi-unit, and circuitry levels can be used as predictors of pain, and possibly to guide targeted neuromodulation of specific brain regions for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, multidisciplinary research into the mechanisms of pain-related phenomena in the brain may offer insights into novel approaches for the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of persistent pain.","Pathological brain states are known to induce massive production of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). At much lower levels, these cytokines are also present in the healthy brain, where it is increasingly being recognized that they exert regulatory influences. Recent studies suggest that TNFα plays important roles in controlling synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we discuss the evidence in support of synaptic regulation by TNFα and the underlying cellular mechanisms, including control of AMPA receptor trafficking and glutamate release from astrocytes. These findings suggest that increases in TNFα levels (caused by nervous system infection, injury, or disease) transform the physiological actions of the cytokine into deleterious ones. This functional switch may contribute to cognitive alterations in several brain pathologies.","The Ca(2+)/Calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated by Ca(2+)/CaM, but becomes partially autonomous (Ca(2+)-independent) upon autophosphorylation at T286. This hallmark feature of CaMKII regulation provides a form of molecular memory and is indeed important in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapse strength and memory formation. However, emerging evidence supports a direct role in information processing, while storage of synaptic information may instead be mediated by regulated interaction of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex. These and other CaMKII regulation mechanisms are discussed here in the context of the kinase structure and their impact on postsynaptic functions. Recent findings also implicate CaMKII in long-term depression (LTD), as well as functional roles at inhibitory synapses, lending renewed emphasis on better understanding the spatiotemporal control of CaMKII regulation.","Addictions to cocaine or heroin/prescription opioids [short-acting μ-opioid receptor (MOPr) agonists] involve relapsing cycles, with experimentation/escalating use, withdrawal/abstinence, and relapse/re-escalation. κ-Opioid receptors (KOPr; encoded by OPRK1), and their endogenous agonists, the dynorphins (encoded by PDYN), have counter-modulatory effects on reward caused by cocaine or MOPr agonist exposure, and exhibit plasticity in addictive-like states. KOPr/dynorphin activation is implicated in depression/anxiety, often comorbid with addictions. In this opinion article we propose that particular stages of the addiction cycle are differentially affected by KOPr/dynorphin systems. Vulnerability and resilience can be due to pre-existing (e.g., genetic) factors, or epigenetic modifications of the OPRK1 or PDYN genes during the addiction cycle. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches limiting changes in KOPr/dynorphin tone, especially with KOPr partial agonists, may hold potential for the treatment of specific drug addictions and psychiatric comorbidity.","The ability to distinguish molecular cues emitted by other individuals is a fundamental feature of social interactions such as finding and identifying a mate, establishing social hierarchies, and initiating interspecies defensive behaviors. In rodents, this ability involves the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a distinct chemoreceptive structure that is part of the olfactory system. Recent insights have led to unprecedented progress in identifying ligand and receptor families underlying vomeronasal recognition, characterizing the behavioral consequences caused by VNO activation, and defining higher neural circuits underlying the initiation of instinctive behaviors such as aggression. Here, we review such findings and discuss future areas for investigation, including large-scale mapping studies, immune system-VNO interactions, in vivo recording of neural activity, and optogenetic alteration of sexual and social behaviors.",,"The basal ganglia network serves to integrate information about context, actions, and outcomes to shape the behavior of an animal based on its past experience. Clinically, the basal ganglia receive the most attention for their role in movement disorders. Recent advances in technology have opened new avenues of research into the structure and function of basal ganglia circuits. One emerging theme is the importance of GABAergic interneurons in coordinating and regulating network function. Here, we discuss evidence that changes in striatal GABAergic microcircuits contribute to basal ganglia dysfunction in several movement disorders. Because interneurons are genetically and neurochemically unique from striatal projection neurons, they may provide promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of striatal-based disorders.","The Brain Prize 2012 was awarded to two remarkable scientists, Christine Petit and Karen Steel, who have exploited the use of human and mouse genetics to revolutionize our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of hearing and deafness, opening up what was previously an inaccessible, but highly important, end organ of the brain. The present article highlights their seminal contributions.","In most organisms, an intrinsic circadian (~24-h) timekeeping system drives rhythms of physiology and behavior. Within cells that contain a circadian clock, specific transcriptional activators and repressors reciprocally regulate each other to generate a basic molecular oscillator. A mismatch of the period generated by this oscillator with the external environment creates circadian disruption, which can have adverse effects on neural function. Although several clock genes have been extensively characterized, a fundamental question remains: how do these genes work together to generate a ~24-h period? Period-altering mutations in clock genes can affect any of multiple regulated steps in the molecular oscillator. In this review, we examine the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to setting the pace of the circadian oscillator.","Methamphetamine damages monoamine-containing nerve terminals in the brains of both animals and human drug abusers, and the cellular mechanisms underlying this injury have been extensively studied. More recently, the growing evidence for methamphetamine influences on memory and executive function of human users has prompted studies of cognitive impairments in methamphetamine-exposed animals. After summarizing current knowledge about the cellular mechanisms of methamphetamine-induced brain injury, this review emphasizes research into the brain changes that underlie the cognitive deficits that accompany repeated methamphetamine exposure. Novel approaches to mitigating or reversing methamphetamine-induced brain and behavioral changes are described, and it is argued that the slow spontaneous reversibility of the injury produced by this drug may offer opportunities for novel treatment development.","The vertebrate retina is a well-characterized and tractable model for studying neurogenesis. Retinal neurons and glia are generated in a conserved sequence from a pool of multipotent progenitor cells, and numerous cell fate determinants for the different classes of retinal cell types have been identified. Here, we summarize several recent developments in the field that have advanced understanding of the regulation of multipotentiality and temporal competence of progenitors. We also discuss recent insights into the relative influence of lineage-based versus stochastic modes of cell fate determination. Enhancing and integrating knowledge of the molecular and genetic machinery underlying retinal development is critically important for understanding not only normal developmental mechanisms, but also therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring vision loss.","Gliomas are terrifying primary brain tumors for which patient outlook remains bleak. Recent research provides novel insights into the unique biology of gliomas. For example, these tumors exhibit an unexpected pluripotency that enables them to grow their own vasculature. They have an unusual ability to navigate tortuous extracellular pathways as they invade, and they use neurotransmitters to inflict damage and create room for growth. Here, we review studies that illustrate the importance of considering interactions of gliomas with their native brain environment. Such studies suggest that gliomas constitute a neurodegenerative disease caused by the malignant growth of brain support cells. The chosen examples illustrate how targeted research into the biology of gliomas is yielding new and much needed therapeutic approaches to this challenging nervous system disease.","A recent paradigm shift in systems neuroscience is the division of the human brain into functional networks. Functional networks are collections of brain regions with strongly correlated activity both at rest and during cognitive tasks, and each network is believed to implement a different aspect of cognition. We propose here that anxiety disorders and high trait anxiety are associated with a particular pattern of functional network dysfunction: increased functioning of the cingulo-opercular and ventral attention networks as well as decreased functioning of the fronto-parietal and default mode networks. This functional network model can be used to differentiate the pathology of anxiety disorders from other psychiatric illnesses such as major depression and provides targets for novel treatment strategies.","Midbrain dopamine neurons supposedly encode reward prediction error, but how error signals are computed remains elusive. Here, we propose a mechanism based on recent findings regarding corticostriatal circuits. Specifically, we propose that two distinct subpopulations of corticostriatal neurons differentially represent the animal's current and previous states/actions through unidirectional connectivity from one subpopulation to the other and strong recurrent excitation that exists only within the recipient subpopulation. These corticostriatal subpopulations selectively connect to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia, such that the temporal difference between the values of current and previous states/actions--the core of the error signal--can be computed. Our hypothesis suggests a unified view of basal ganglia functions and has important clinical implications.","Migraine is a common disabling brain disorder whose key manifestations are recurrent attacks of unilateral headache and interictal hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Migraine arises from a primary brain dysfunction that leads to episodic activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pain pathway and as a consequence to headache. Major open issues concern the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the primary brain dysfunction(s) and of migraine pain. We review here our current understanding of these mechanisms, focusing on recent advances regarding migraine genetics, headache mechanisms, and the primary brain dysfunction(s) underlying migraine onset and susceptibility to cortical spreading depression, the neurophysiological correlate of migraine aura. We also discuss insights obtained from the functional analysis of familial hemiplegic migraine mouse models.","Astroglial excitability is largely mediated by fluctuations in intracellular ion concentrations. In addition to generally acknowledged Ca²⁺ excitability of astroglia, recent studies have demonstrated that neuronal activity triggers transient increases in the cytosolic Na⁺ concentration ([Na⁺](i)) in perisynaptic astrocytes. These [Na⁺](i) transients are controlled by multiple Na⁺-permeable channels and Na⁺-dependent transporters; spatiotemporally organized [Na⁺](i) dynamics in turn regulate diverse astroglial homeostatic responses such as metabolic/signaling utilization of lactate and glutamate, transmembrane transport of neurotransmitters and K⁺ buffering. In particular, near-membrane [Na⁺](i) transients determine the rate and the direction of the transmembrane transport of GABA and Ca²⁺. We discuss here the role of Na⁺ in the regulation of various systems that mediate fast bidirectional communication between neurones and glia at the single synapse level.","The existence of a primitive CNS function involved in the activation of all vertebrate behaviors, generalized arousal (GA), has been proposed. Here, we provide an overview of the neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and molecular properties of reticular neurons within the nucleus gigantocellularis (NGC) of the mammalian medulla, and propose that the properties of these neurons equip them to contribute powerfully to GA. We also explore the hypothesis that these neurons may have evolved from the Mauthner cell in the medulla of teleost fish, although NGC neurons have a wider range of action far beyond the specific escape network served by Mauthner cells. Understanding the neuronal circuits that control and regulate GA is central to understanding how motivated behaviors such as hunger, thirst and sexual behaviors arise.","In addition to muscle disease, defects in processing and assembly of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) are associated with a spectrum of brain abnormalities ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to neuronal migration disorders. In brain, the DGC is involved in the organisation of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-containing protein complexes in neurons and glia, respectively. During development, defects in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan that impair its ability to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) are frequently associated with cobblestone lissencephaly and mental retardation. Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding ɛ-sarcoglycan (SGCE) cause the neurogenic movement disorder myoclonus dystonia syndrome. In this review, we describe recent progress in defining distinct roles for the DGC in neurons and glia.","Opening of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs) is the earliest event occurring in mechanosensory transduction. The molecular identity of mammalian SACs has long remained a mystery. Only very recently, Piezo1 and Piezo2 have been shown to be essential components of distinct SACs and moreover, purified Piezo1 forms cationic channels when reconstituted into artificial bilayers. In line with these findings, dPiezo was demonstrated to act in the Drosophila mechanical nociception pathway. Finally, the 3D structure of the two-pore domain potassium channel (K(2P)), TRAAK [weakly inward rectifying K⁺ channel (TWIK)-related arachidonic acid stimulated K⁺ channel], has recently been solved, providing valuable information about pharmacology, selectivity and gating mechanisms of stretch-activated K⁺ channels (SAKs). These recent findings allow a better understanding of the molecular basis of molecular and cellular mechanotransduction.","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a useful tool for studying anatomy and pathology in the rodent central nervous system (CNS).The unique tissue contrasts provided by DTI are well suited for monitoring disease progression, studying brain development, and characterizing anatomical phenotypes. Recent technical developments have vastly improved the speed and resolution of rodent DTI. Ongoing research efforts exploring the microstructural basis of DTI signals have provided useful insights into its capabilities to delineate brain structures and detect neuropathology. Significant progress has also been made in combining DTI results with data acquired using other imaging modalities to enhance our understanding of the rodent CNS.","The vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a peripheral synapse formed between motoneuron and skeletal muscle, is characterized by a protracted postnatal period of maturation and life-long maintenance. In neuromuscular disorders such as congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs), disruptions of NMJ maturation and/or maintenance are frequently observed. In particular, defective neuromuscular transmission associated with structural and molecular abnormalities at the pre- and postsynaptic membranes, as well as at the synaptic cleft, has been reported in these patients. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of molecular and cellular events that mediate NMJ maturation and maintenance. The underlying regulatory mechanisms, including key molecular regulators at the presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic muscle membrane, are discussed.","The 'thrifty gene hypothesis' posits that evolution preferentially selects physiological mechanisms that optimize energy storage to increase survival under alternating conditions of abundance and scarcity of food. Recent experiments suggest that endocannabinoids - a class of lipid-derived mediators that activate cannabinoid receptors in many cells of the body - are key agents of energy conservation. The new evidence indicates that these compounds increase energy intake and decrease energy expenditure by controlling the activity of peripheral and central neural pathways involved in the sensing and hedonic processing of sweet and fatty foods, as well as in the storage of their energy content for future use.","Injury or insult to the adult nervous system often results in reactivation of signaling pathways that are normally only active during development. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is one such signaling molecule whose expression increases markedly following neural injury in many of the same cell types that express p75(NTR) during development. A series of studies during the past decade has demonstrated that p75(NTR) signaling contributes to neuronal and glial cell damage, axonal degeneration and dysfunction during injury and cellular stress. Why the nervous system reacts to injury by inducing a molecule that aids the demise of cells and axons is a biological paradox that remains to be explained satisfactorily. On the other hand, it may offer unique therapeutic opportunities for limiting the severity of nervous system injury and disease.","The dopamine system is involved in motivation, reward and learning, and dysfunction in this system has been implicated in several disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. Key progress in our understanding of its functions has come from extracellular in vivo electrophysiological recordings from midbrain dopamine neurons. Numerous studies have used a defined set of criteria to identify dopamine neurons electrophysiologically. However, a few recent studies have suggested that a minority population of non-dopamine neurons may not be readily distinguishable from dopamine neurons, raising questions as to the reliability of past findings. We provide an overview of the key findings related to this controversy and assess the criteria used for the electrophysiological identification of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA).",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2012 Jul;35(7):454-5.,"The advent of unbiased recording and imaging techniques to evaluate firing activity across neocortical neurons has revealed substantial heterogeneity in response properties in vivo, and that a minority of neurons are responsible for the majority of spikes. Despite the computational advantages to sparsely firing populations, experimental data defining the fraction of responsive neurons and the range of firing rates have not been synthesized. Here we review data about the distribution of activity across neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex. Overall, the firing output of granular and infragranular layers is highest. Although subthreshold activity across supragranular neurons is decidedly non-sparse, spikes are much less frequent and some cells are silent. Superficial layers of the cortex may employ specific cell and circuit mechanisms to increase sparseness.","Axonal degeneration is a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction in many neurological conditions and has additional roles in development. It can be triggered by divergent stimuli including mechanical, metabolic, infectious, toxic, hereditary and inflammatory stresses. Axonal mitochondria are an important convergence point as regulators of bioenergetic metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca²⁺ homeostasis and protease activation. The challenges likely to render axonal mitochondria more vulnerable than their cellular counterparts are reviewed, including axonal transport, replenishing nuclear-encoded proteins and maintenance of quality control, fusion and fission in locations remote from the cell body. The potential for mitochondria to act as a decision node in axon loss is considered, highlighting the need to understand the biology of axonal mitochondria and their contributions to degenerative mechanisms for novel therapeutic strategies.","Many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are characterized by age-dependent symptom onset and regression, particularly during early postnatal periods of life. The neurobiological mechanisms preceding and underlying these developmental cognitive and behavioral impairments are, however, not clearly understood. Recent evidence using animal models for monogenic NDDs demonstrates the existence of time-regulated windows of neuronal and synaptic impairments. We propose that these developmentally-dependent impairments can be unified into a key concept: namely, time-restricted windows for impaired synaptic phenotypes exist in NDDs, akin to critical periods during normal sensory development in the brain. Existence of sensitive time-windows has significant implications for our understanding of early brain development underlying NDDs and may indicate vulnerable periods when the brain is more susceptible to current therapeutic treatments.","Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are illicitly administered to enhance athletic performance and body image. Although conferring positive actions on performance, steroid abuse is associated with changes in anxiety and aggression. AAS users are often keenly invested in understanding the biological actions of these drugs. Thus, mechanistic information on AAS actions is important not only for the biomedical community, but also for steroid users. Here we review findings from animal studies on the impact of AAS exposure on neural systems that are crucial for the production of anxiety and aggression, and compare the effects of the different classes of AAS and their potential signaling mechanisms, as well as context-, age- and sex-dependent aspects of their actions.","Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) respond to many different kinds of stimulus. The ability to discriminate between the diverse types of sensation is reflected by the existence of functionally and morphologically specialized sensory neurons. This neuronal diversity is created in a step-wise process extending well into postnatal life. Here, we review the hierarchical organization and the molecular process involving interactions between environmental growth factors, used and reused in different developmental contexts in self-reinforcing and cross-inhibitory mechanisms, and intrinsic gene programs that underlie the progressive diversification of sensory progenitors into specialized neurons. The recent advance in knowledge of sensory neuron specification may provide mechanistic principles that could extend to other parts of the nervous system.","Visual transduction in the Drosophila compound eye functions through a pathway that couples rhodopsin to phospholipase C (PLC) and the opening of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. This cascade differs from phototransduction in mammalian rods and cones, but is remarkably similar to signaling in mammalian intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In this review, I focus on recent advances in the fly visual system, including the discovery of a visual cycle and insights into the machinery and mechanisms involved in generating a light response in photoreceptor cells.","The assembly and function of neuronal circuits rely on selective cell-cell interactions to control axon targeting, generate pre- and postsynaptic specialization and recruit neurotransmitter receptors. In neurons, EphB receptor tyrosine kinases mediate excitatory synaptogenesis early during development, and then later coordinate synaptic function by controlling synaptic glutamate receptor localization and function. EphBs direct synapse formation and function to regulate cellular morphology through downstream signaling mechanisms and by interacting with glutamate receptors. In humans, defective EphB-dependent regulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) localization and function is associated with neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we propose that EphBs act as a central organizer of excitatory synapse formation and function, and as a key regulator of diseases linked to NMDAR dysfunction.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA transcripts expressed throughout the brain that can regulate neuronal gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Here, we provide an overview of the role for miRNAs in brain development and function, and review evidence suggesting that dysfunction in miRNA signaling contributes to neurodevelopment disorders such as Rett and fragile X syndromes, as well as complex behavioral disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction. A better understanding of how miRNAs influence the development of neuropsychiatric disorders may reveal fundamental insights into the causes of these devastating illnesses and offer novel targets for therapeutic development.","Although public health campaigns advise pregnant women to abstain from ethanol, drinking during pregnancy is pervasive. Here, we highlight recent studies that have clearly demonstrated long-lasting neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring of laboratory animals exposed to moderate levels of ethanol during development. Alterations in learning, memory, motor coordination, social behavior, and stress responses were identified in these animals. Increased vulnerability to substance abuse was also demonstrated. These behavioral alterations have been associated with impairments in neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators, and/or synaptic plasticity in several brain regions. With this review we hope to contribute to a better appreciation of the potential effects of developmental exposure to moderate ethanol levels, leading to better interventions aimed at relieving fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.","Learning and memory processes carried out within the hippocampus are influenced by stress in a complex manner, and the mechanisms by which stress modulates the physiology of the hippocampus are not fully understood. This review addresses how the production and release of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) within the hippocampus during stress influences neuronal structure and hippocampal function. CRH functions in the contexts of acute and chronic stresses taking place during development, adulthood and aging. Current challenges are to uncover how the dynamic actions of CRH integrate with the well-established roles of adrenal-derived steroid stress hormones to shape the cognitive functions of the hippocampus in response to stress.","Life and societies would change significantly if memory capacity or persistence in health and disease could be enhanced. It has been known for many years that memory can be improved and strengthened. Substances known to enhance memory include hormones, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and metabolic substrates. Recently, attention has been given to identifying the molecular mechanisms and targets whereby memory enhancement can be achieved. One approach would be to target the physiological changes that are induced by learning and naturally required for memory strengthening via consolidation and reconsolidation. Here, we review approaches that boost memories by targeting the cAMP response element binding protein-CCAAT enhancer binding protein (CREB-C/EBP) pathway and/or its recently identified target gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2).","Although, the nucleolus has been observed for almost 200 years in neurons, studies that directly address the neuronal roles of this subnuclear structure have appeared only recently. The aim of this review is to discuss recent progress and identify some critical questions that remain to be answered. As expected for the cellular center of ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus is essential for the growth of developing neurons, including neurite morphogenesis and long-term maintenance of mature neurons. In addition, the nucleolus contributes to neuronal stress responses, including the regulation of apoptosis. Hence, disrupted neurodevelopment or neurodegeneration are among the likely consequences of nucleolar dysfunction. Conversely, the presence of active nucleoli may determine the potential for neurorepair.","Information that is congruent with existing knowledge (a schema) is usually better remembered than less congruent information. Only recently, however, has the role of schemas in memory been studied from a systems neuroscience perspective. Moreover, incongruent (novel) information is also sometimes better remembered. Here, we review lesion and neuroimaging findings in animals and humans that relate to this apparent paradoxical relationship between schema and novelty. In addition, we sketch a framework relating key brain regions in medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during encoding, consolidation and retrieval of information as a function of its congruency with existing information represented in neocortex. An important aspect of this framework is the efficiency of learning enabled by congruency-dependent MTL-mPFC interactions.","Sortilin is a type-1 receptor expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Initially considered a rather peculiar receptor resembling an intracellular sorting protein in yeast, sortilin has emerged as a key player in the regulation of neuronal viability and function. It acts as a receptor of neurotrophic factors and neuropeptides, but also as a co-receptor to cytokine receptors, tyrosine receptor kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and ion-channels. Here, we review recent findings that identified multiple roles for sortilin in the cellular transport and signaling. Furthermore, we discuss how sortilin contributes not only to the functional integrity of the nervous system during physiological conditions but also plays an important role during neuronal injury and disease processes.","Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder associated with compulsive drug taking, drug seeking and a loss of control in limiting intake, reflected in three stages of a recurrent cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (""craving""). This review discusses the role of adult-born neural and glial progenitors in drug seeking associated with the different stages of the addiction cycle. A review of the current literature suggests that the loss of newly born progenitors, particularly in hippocampal and cortical regions, plays a role in determining vulnerability to relapse in rodent models of drug addiction. The normalization of drug-impaired neurogenesis or gliogenesis may help reverse neuroplasticity during abstinence and, thus, may help reduce the vulnerability to relapse and aid recovery.","The two GluN3 subunits were the last NMDA receptor subunits to be cloned some 15 years ago. Strikingly, despite the steadily growing interest in their function, their physiological role remains elusive. The original billing as dominant-negative modulators of classical NMDA receptors composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits has given way to proposals of much more complex functions, including roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In addition, GluN3 subunits in the absence of GluN2 surprisingly assemble with GluN1 into excitatory glycine receptors. This review provides an overview of the unique spatial and temporal expression patterns of the GluN3 subunits, discusses proposed functions and physiological roles for receptors comprising these subunits, and briefly summarizes their putative involvement in several neural diseases.","Cell-cell communication by juxtacrine signaling plays a key role in the development of the nervous system, from cell fate determination through axonal guidance to synaptogenesis. Interestingly, several juxtacrine signaling systems exhibit an inhibitory interaction between receptors and ligands in the same cell, termed cis inhibition. These include the Notch, semaphorin and ephrin signaling systems. Here we review the role of cis inhibition in these signaling systems in the development of the nervous system. We compare and contrast cis inhibition mechanisms and discuss their potential cellular function as a threshold-generating mechanism. The prevalence of cis inhibition suggests that these interactions and their functional regulatory roles may serve as a general design principle for juxtacrine signaling-mediated processes during and beyond neurodevelopment.","Animals use acoustic signals to communicate and to obtain information about their environment. The processing of acoustic signals is initiated at auditory sense organs, where mechanosensory hair cells convert sound-induced vibrations into electrical signals. Although the biophysical principles underlying the mechanotransduction process in hair cells have been characterized in much detail over the past 30 years, the molecular building-blocks of the mechanotransduction machinery have proved to be difficult to determine. We review here recent studies that have both identified some of these molecules and established the mechanisms by which they regulate the activity of the still-elusive mechanotransduction channel.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) reflect the spectrum of neural impairments seen during chronic viral infection. Current research efforts focus on improving antiretroviral and adjunctive therapies, defining disease onset and progression, facilitating drug delivery, and halting neurodegeneration and viral resistance. Because HIV is species-specific, generating disease in small-animal models has proved challenging. After two decades of research, rodent HAND models now include those containing a human immune system. Antiviral responses, neuroinflammation and immunocyte blood-brain barrier (BBB) trafficking follow HIV infection in these rodent models. We review these and other rodent models of HAND and discuss their unmet potential in reflecting human pathobiology and in facilitating disease monitoring and therapeutic discoveries.","Understanding how sensory pathways transmit information under natural conditions remains a major goal in neuroscience. The vestibular system plays a vital role in everyday life, contributing to a wide range of functions from reflexes to the highest levels of voluntary behavior. Recent experiments establishing that vestibular (self-motion) processing is inherently multimodal also provide insight into a set of interrelated questions. What neural code is used to represent sensory information in vestibular pathways? How do the interactions between the organism and the environment shape encoding? How is self-motion information processing adjusted to meet the needs of specific tasks? This review highlights progress that has recently been made towards understanding how the brain encodes and processes self-motion to ensure accurate motor control.","Axon growth is driven by the movement of a growth cone, a specialized sensory motile structure located at the tip of a growing neurite. Although stalled retraction bulbs have long been recognized as hallmarks of regeneration failure, mechanisms that control the formation and migration of nerve endings are only beginning to be unraveled. Recent studies point to microtubules as key determinants for such processes, and emerging evidence suggests that regulators of actin and microtubule dynamics in the growth cone might serve as attractive targets for controlling both the speed and trajectory of regenerating axons. This review discusses the potential of and recent progress in direct modulation of the growth cone machinery as a novel strategy to promote axon regeneration in the nervous system after injury.","Functional regeneration within the adult spinal cord remains a formidable task. A major barrier to regeneration of sensory axons into the spinal cord is the dorsal root entry zone. This region displays many of the inhibitory features characteristic of other central nervous system injuries. Several experimental treatments, including inactivation of inhibitory molecules (such as Nogo and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) or administration of neurotrophic factors (such as nerve growth factor, neurotrophin3, glial-derived neurotrophic factor and artemin), have been found to promote anatomical and functional regeneration across this barrier. However, there have been relatively few experiments to determine whether regenerating axons project back to their appropriate target areas within the spinal cord. This review focuses on recent advances in sensory axon regeneration, including studies assessing the ability of sensory axons to reconnect with their original synaptic targets.","Although the diversity of neocortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons is recognized in terms of their anatomical, molecular and functional properties, principal cells are usually assumed to constitute homogenous populations. However, even within a single layer, subpopulations of principal cells can often be differentiated by their distinct long-range projection targets. Such subpopulations of principal cells can have different local connection properties and excitatory inputs, forming subnetworks that may serve as separate information-processing channels. Interestingly, as reviewed here, recent evidence has revealed specific instances where interneuron cell types selectively innervated distinct subpopulations of principal cells, targeting only those with particular long-distance projection targets. This organization represents a novel form of interneuron specialization, providing interneurons with the potential to selectively regulate specific information-processing streams.","Conditioning and extinction of fear have traditionally been viewed as two independent learning processes for encoding representations of contexts or cues (conditioned stimuli, CS), aversive events (unconditioned stimuli, US), and their relationship. Based on the analysis of protein kinase signaling patterns in neurons of the fear circuit, we propose that fear and extinction are best conceptualized as emotional states triggered by a single CS representation with two opposing values: aversive and non-aversive. These values are conferred by the presence or absence of the US and encoded by distinct sets of kinase signaling pathways and their downstream targets. Modulating specific protein kinases thus has the potential to modify emotional states, and hence, may emerge as a promising treatment for anxiety disorders.","Dendritic spines, small bulbous postsynaptic compartments emanating from neuronal dendrites, have been thought to serve as basic units of memory storage. Despite their small size (~0.1 femtoliter), thousands of species of proteins exist in the spine, including receptors, channels, scaffolding proteins and signaling enzymes. Biochemical signaling mediated by these molecules leads to morphological and functional plasticity of dendritic spines, and ultimately learning and memory in the brain. Here, we review new insights into the mechanisms underlying spine plasticity brought about by recent advances in imaging techniques to monitor molecular events in single dendritic spines. The activity of each protein displays a specific spatiotemporal pattern, coordinating downstream events at different microdomains to change the function and morphology of dendritic spines.","Understanding how sensory stimuli drive behavior requires a detailed understanding of the molecular and neural nature through which the stimuli are received and processed. The visual system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster shares marked similarities to that of mammals. Although much focus has been given to the fly visual system, an even further simplified eye and brain makes the visual system of Drosophila larvae an excellent model for dissecting sensory processing and behavioral responses to light. Recent work has identified sensory and central brain neurons required for larval visual behaviors, including circadian rhythms. Here, we review the genes and neurons regulating visual processing in Drosophila larvae and discuss the implications of this work for furthering understanding of more complex visual systems.","Glial cells and neurons are engaged in a continuous and highly regulated bidirectional dialog. A remarkable example is the control of myelination. Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) wrap their plasma membranes around axons to organize myelinated nerve fibers that allow rapid saltatory conduction. The functionality of this system is critical, as revealed by numerous neurological diseases that result from deregulation of the system, including multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies. In this review we focus on PNS myelination and present a conceptual framework that integrates crucial signaling mechanisms with basic SC biology. We will highlight signaling hubs and overarching molecular mechanisms, including genetic, epigenetic, and post-translational controls, which together regulate the interplay between SCs and axons, extracellular signals, and the transcriptional network.","Trisomy for human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) results in Down syndrome (DS). The finished human genome sequence provides a thorough catalog of the genetic elements whose altered dosage perturbs development and function in DS. However, understanding how small alterations in the steady state transcript levels for <2% of human genes can disrupt development and function of essentially every cell presents a more complicated problem. Mouse models that recapitulate specific aspects of DS have been used to identify changes in brain morphogenesis and function. Here we provide a few examples of how trisomy for specific genes affects the development of the cortex and cerebellum to illustrate how gene dosage effects might contribute to divergence between the trisomic and euploid brains.","The presence of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) on the cell surface is critical for the neurotoxicity of prions. Although several biological activities have been attributed to PrP(C), a definitive demonstration of its physiological function remains elusive. In this review, we discuss some of the proposed functions of PrP(C), focusing on recently suggested roles in cell adhesion, regulation of ionic currents at the cell membrane and neuroprotection. We also discuss recent evidence supporting the idea that PrP(C) may function as a receptor for soluble oligomers of the amyloid β peptide and possibly other toxic protein aggregates. These data suggest surprising new connections between the physiological function of PrP(C) and its role in neurodegenerative diseases beyond those caused by prions.","Cortical development is dependent on stimulus-driven learning. The absence of sensory input from birth, as occurs in congenital deafness, affects normal growth and connectivity needed to form a functional sensory system, resulting in deficits in oral language learning. Cochlear implants bypass cochlear damage by directly stimulating the auditory nerve and brain, making it possible to avoid many of the deleterious effects of sensory deprivation. Congenitally deaf animals and children who receive implants provide a platform to examine the characteristics of cortical plasticity in the auditory system. In this review, we discuss the existence of time limits for, and mechanistic constraints on, sensitive periods for cochlear implantation and describe the effects of multimodal and cognitive reorganization that result from long-term auditory deprivation.","Basic and clinical studies demonstrate that stress and depression are associated with atrophy and loss of neurons and glia, which contribute to the decreased size and function of limbic brain regions that control mood and depression, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Here, we review findings that suggest that opposing effects of stress and/or depression and antidepressants on neurotrophic factor expression and signaling partly explain these effects. We also discuss recent reports that suggest a possible role for glycogen synthase kinase 3 and upstream wingless (Wnt)-frizzled (Fz) signaling pathways in mood disorders. New studies also demonstrate that the rapid antidepressant actions of NMDA receptor antagonists are associated with activation of glutamate transmission and induction of synaptogenesis, providing novel targets for a new generation of fast-acting, more efficacious therapeutic agents.","Mood-stabilizing drugs are the most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder, a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Despite extensive clinical utilization, significant questions concerning their mechanisms of action remain. In recent years, a diverse set of molecular and cellular targets of these drugs has been identified. Based on these findings, downstream effects on neural and synaptic plasticity within key circuits have been proposed. Here, we discuss recent data, identify current challenges impeding progress and define areas for future investigation. Further understanding of the primary targets and downstream levels of convergence of mood-stabilizing drugs will guide development of novel therapeutic strategies and help translate discoveries into more effective treatments with less burdensome adverse-effect profiles.", ,"Accumulating evidence indicates substantial etiological and pathophysiological heterogeneity as well as overlap within and across psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it is uncertain at what level, besides gross behavior, mental illnesses can be differentiated. To advance our understanding of psychiatric disease, we advocate a more systematic approach in characterizing a small number of animal models by utilizing unequivocal rare disease mutations and targeted cognitive assessment to identify convergent disease circuits and mechanisms. Based on available data, we discuss the possibility that the temporal dynamics of synaptic plasticity play a central role in disease pathophysiology and that the extent and manner in which they are altered in specific neural circuits determine the exact clinical phenotype of diverse disorders.","Anhedonia, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure, is a hallmark symptom of major depression, schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the past three decades, the clinical definition of anhedonia has remained relatively unchanged, although cognitive psychology and behavioral neuroscience have expanded our understanding of other reward-related processes. Here, we review the neural bases of the construct of anhedonia that reflects deficits in hedonic capacity and also closely linked to the constructs of reward valuation, decision-making, anticipation and motivation. The neural circuits subserving these reward-related processes include the ventral striatum, prefrontal cortical regions, and afferent and efferent projections. An understanding of anhedonia and other reward-related constructs will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that include reward deficits as key symptoms.","Suicide and related behaviors are complex phenomena associated with different risk factors. Although most individuals who display suicidal behavior do not have a history of early-life adversity, a significant minority does. Recent animal and human data have suggested that early-life adversity leads to epigenetic regulation of genes involved in stress-response systems. Here, we review this evidence and suggest that early-life adversity increases risk of suicide in susceptible individuals by influencing the development of stable emotional, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes that are likely to result from the epigenetic regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and other systems involved in responses to stress.","Deficits in cognitive control, a core disturbance of schizophrenia, appear to emerge from impaired prefrontal gamma oscillations. Cortical gamma oscillations require strong inhibitory inputs to pyramidal neurons from the parvalbumin basket cell (PVBC) class of GABAergic neurons. Recent findings indicate that schizophrenia is associated with multiple pre- and postsynaptic abnormalities in PVBCs, each of which weakens their inhibitory control of pyramidal cells. These findings suggest a new model of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia in which PVBC inhibition is decreased to compensate for an upstream deficit in pyramidal cell excitation. This compensation is thought to rebalance cortical excitation and inhibition, but at a level insufficient to generate the gamma oscillation power required for high levels of cognitive control.","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after a traumatic experience such as domestic violence, natural disasters or combat-related trauma. The cost of such disorders on society and the individual can be tremendous. In this article, we review how the neural circuitry implicated in PTSD in humans is related to the neural circuitry of fear. We then discuss how fear conditioning is a suitable model for studying the molecular mechanisms of the fear components that underlie PTSD, and the biology of fear conditioning with a particular focus on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), GABAergic and glutamatergic ligand-receptor systems. We then summarize how such approaches might help to inform our understanding of PTSD and other stress-related disorders and provide insight to new pharmacological avenues of treatment of PTSD.","Src family kinases (SFKs) are non-receptor-type protein tyrosine kinases that were originally identified as the products of proto-oncogenes and were subsequently implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing mammalian brain. Recent studies using transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that SFKs that are highly expressed in the adult brain regulate neuronal plasticity and behavior through tyrosine phosphorylation of key substrates such as neurotransmitter receptors. Here, we provide an overview of these recent studies, as well as discussing how modulation of the endocytosis of neurotransmitter receptors by SFKs contributes, in part, to this regulation. Deregulation of SFK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of such substrates might underlie certain brain disorders.","Synchronised neuronal oscillations at beta frequencies are prevalent in the human motor system, but their function is unclear. In this Opinion article, we propose that the levels of beta oscillations provide a measure of the likelihood that a new voluntary action will need to be actuated. Oscillatory beta activity is in turn modulated by net dopamine levels at sites of cortical input to the basal ganglia. We hypothesise that net dopamine levels are modulated in response to salient internal and external cues. Crucially, the resulting modulation of beta activity is predictive, enabling the appropriate prospective resourcing and preparation of potential actions. Loss of dopamine, as in Parkinson's disease, annuls this function, unless net dopaminergic activity can be elevated through medication.","Caspases are cysteine-aspartic proteases that post-translationally modify their substrates through cleavage at specific sites, which causes either substrate inactivation or a gain of function through the generation of active fragments. Currently, each caspase is categorized as either an initiator of apoptosis or an end-stage executioner. Caspase-6 was originally identified as an executioner caspase owing to its role in cleavage of nuclear lamins. However, it has since been shown that caspase-6 cleaves caspases-2, 3 and 8. Furthermore, active caspase-6 is present in post mortem brains of Huntington and Alzheimer disease subjects that do not yet display apoptotic morphology, which suggests a function distinct from its well-validated executioner role. In this review, we discuss evidence to date regarding the role of caspase-6 in neurodegeneration. The findings suggest that selective inhibitors of caspase-6 may have therapeutic potential for various neurodegenerative disorders.","Death receptors (DRs) are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily that are characterised by the presence of a conserved intracellular death domain and are able to trigger a signalling pathway leading to apoptosis. Strong evidence suggests that DRs contribute to the pathology of tissue destructive diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review the evidence supporting a role for DRs in MS pathology and its implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for MS and other demyelinating pathologies of the CNS.","The direction-selective circuit in the retina extracts the directional information of image motion in the visual scene. It is a classic model for neural circuit analysis because its input and output are well-defined and accessible to physiological measurements. However, the neural basis of direction selectivity is still not fully understood. Indeed, this ostensibly simple computation arises from a collection of complex neural mechanisms at all levels of circuit organization. In this review, we describe recent advances in genetic, imaging and optogenetic techniques that have improved our understanding of the synaptic organization and development underlying retinal direction selectivity.","The ability to perceive one's position and directional heading relative to landmarks is necessary for successful navigation within an environment. Recent studies have shown that the visual system dominantly controls the neural representations of directional heading and location when familiar visual cues are available, and several neural circuits, or streams, have been proposed to be crucial for visual information processing. Here, we summarize the evidence that the dorsal presubiculum (also known as the postsubiculum) is critically important for the direct transfer of visual landmark information to spatial signals within the limbic system.","Resolvins, including D and E series resolvins, are endogenous lipid mediators generated during the resolution phase of acute inflammation from the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Resolvins have potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution actions in several animal models of inflammation. Recent findings also demonstrate that resolvin E1 and resolvin D1 can each potently dampen inflammatory and postoperative pain. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which resolvins act on their receptors in immune cells and neurons to normalize exaggerated pain via regulation of inflammatory mediators, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, and spinal cord synaptic transmission. Resolvins may offer novel therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating pain conditions associated with inflammation.","The activity-regulated cytoskeletal (Arc) gene encodes a protein that is critical for memory consolidation. Arc is one of the most tightly regulated molecules known: neuronal activity controls Arc mRNA induction, trafficking and accumulation, and Arc protein production, localization and stability. Arc regulates synaptic strength through multiple mechanisms and is involved in essentially every known form of synaptic plasticity. It also mediates memory formation and is implicated in multiple neurological diseases. In this review, we will discuss how Arc is regulated and used as a tool to study neuronal activity. We will also attempt to clarify how its molecular functions correspond to its requirement in various forms of plasticity, discuss Arc's role in behavior and disease, and highlight critical unresolved questions.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease involving motor abnormalities that include akinesia, rigidity and postural instability. While improved diagnostic criteria have aided the accurate diagnosis of MSA, our understanding of the neuropathological aspects underlying MSA was bolstered by the identification of α-synuclein (α-syn) as the primary constituent of the abnormal protein aggregates observed in the brains of MSA patients. The generation of transgenic animal models of MSA coupled with an increasing understanding of the biochemical structure and function of α-syn has highlighted a number of key pathological pathways thought to underlie the neurodegeneration observed in MSA. This review summarizes key findings in the field, discusses current areas of debate, and describes current experimental approaches towards disease-modifying therapies.","For decades, rods and cones were thought to be the only photoreceptors in the mammalian retina. However, a population of atypical photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ipRGCs are crucial for relaying light information from the retina to the brain to control circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex, and sleep. ipRGCs were initially described as a uniform population involved solely in signaling irradiance for non-image forming functions. Recent work, however, has uncovered that ipRGCs are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular, cellular and functional levels, and could even be involved in image formation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the diversity of ipRGCs and their various roles in modulating behavior.", ,"The Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Foundation awarded the inaugural Brain Prize 2011 to Péter Somogyi, Tamás Freund and György Buzsáki 'for their wide-ranging, technically and conceptually brilliant research on the functional organization of neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex, especially in the hippocampus, a region that is crucial for certain forms of memory'. The present article highlights key findings and major conceptual contributions by these three scientists that were recognized by the award.","The hippocampal formation and striatum subserve declarative and procedural memory, respectively. However, experimental evidence suggests that the ventral striatum, as opposed to the dorsal striatum, does not lend itself to being part of either system. Instead, it may constitute a system integrating inputs from the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to generate motivational, outcome-predicting signals that invigorate goal-directed behaviors. Inspired by reinforcement learning models, we suggest an alternative scheme for computational functions of the striatum. Dorsal and ventral striatum are proposed to compute outcome predictions largely in parallel, using different types of information as input. The nature of the inputs to striatum is furthermore combinatorial, and the specificity of predictions transcends the level of scalar value signals, incorporating episodic information.","The hippocampus integrates the encoding, storage and recall of memories, binding the spatio-temporal and sensory information that constitutes experience and keeping episodes in their correct context. The rapid and accurate processing of such daunting volumes of continuously changing data relies on dynamically assigning different aspects of mnemonic processing to specialized, interconnected networks corresponding to the anatomical subfields of dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1. However, differentially processed information ultimately has to be reintegrated into conjunctive representations, and this is unlikely to be achieved by unidirectional, sequential steps through a DG-CA3-CA1 loop. In this Review, we highlight recently discovered anatomical and physiological features that are likely to necessitate updates to the hippocampal circuit diagram, particularly by incorporating the oft-neglected CA2 region.","According to the Hebb rule, the change in the strength of a synapse depends only on the local interaction of presynaptic and postsynaptic events. Studies at many types of synapses indicate that the early phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) has Hebbian properties. However, it is now clear that the Hebb rule does not account for late LTP; this requires an additional signal that is non-local. For novel information and motivational events such as rewards this signal at hippocampal CA1 synapses is mediated by the neuromodulator, dopamine. In this Review we discuss recent experimental findings that support the view that this 'neoHebbian' framework can account for memory behavior in a variety of learning situations.","The ability to discriminate among similar experiences is a crucial feature of episodic memory. This ability has long been hypothesized to require the hippocampus, and computational models suggest that it is dependent on pattern separation. However, empirical data for the role of the hippocampus in pattern separation have not been available until recently. This review summarizes data from electrophysiological recordings, lesion studies, immediate-early gene imaging, transgenic mouse models, as well as human functional neuroimaging, that provide convergent evidence for the involvement of particular hippocampal subfields in this key process. We discuss the impact of aging and adult neurogenesis on pattern separation, and also highlight several challenges to linking across species and approaches, and suggest future directions for investigation.","Memories are often classified as hippocampus dependent or independent, and sleep has been found to facilitate both, but in different ways. In this Opinion, we explore the optimal neural state for cellular and systems consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories that benefit from sleep. We suggest that these two kinds of consolidation, which are ordinarily treated separately, overlap in time and jointly benefit from a period of reduced interference (during which no new memories are formed). Conditions that result in reduced interference include slow wave sleep (SWS), NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, alcohol and acetylcholine antagonists. We hypothesize that the consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memories might not depend on SWS per se. Instead, the brain opportunistically consolidates previously encoded memories whenever the hippocampus is not otherwise occupied by the task of encoding new memories.","Sensory dendrites fall into many different morphological and functional classes. Polymodal nociceptors are one subclass of sensory neurons, which are of particular note owing to their elaborate dendritic arbors. Complex developmental programs are required to form these arbors and there is striking conservation of morphology, function and molecular determinants between vertebrate and invertebrate polymodal nociceptors. Based on these studies, we argue that arbor morphology plays an important role in the function of polymodal nociceptors. Similar associations between form and function might explain the plethora of dendrite morphologies seen among all sensory neurons.","Understanding the neural basis of visual perception is a long-standing fundamental goal of neuroscience. Historically, most vision studies were carried out on humans, macaques and cats. Over the past 5 years, however, a growing number of researchers have begun using mice to parse the mechanisms underlying visual processing; the rationale is that, despite having relatively poor acuity, mice are unmatched in terms of the variety and sophistication of tools available to label, monitor and manipulate specific cell types and circuits. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the mouse visual system at the anatomical, receptive field and perceptual level, focusing on the opportunities and constraints those features provide toward the goal of understanding how vision works.","Sleep is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved aspect of animal life. Recent studies have shed light on the role of sleep in synaptic plasticity. Demonstrations of memory replay and synapse homeostasis suggest that one essential role of sleep is in the consolidation and optimization of synaptic circuits to retain salient memory traces despite the noise of daily experience. Here, we review this recent evidence and suggest that sleep creates a heightened state of plasticity, which may be essential for this optimization. Furthermore, we discuss how sleep deficits seen in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders might not just reflect underlying circuit malfunction, but could also play a direct role in the progression of those disorders.","Regulated neurotransmitter secretion depends on Ca(2+) sensors, C2 domain proteins that associate with phospholipids and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes to trigger release upon Ca(2+) binding. Ca(2+) sensors are thought to prevent spontaneous fusion at rest (clamping) and to promote fusion upon Ca(2+) activation. At least eight, often coexpressed, Ca(2+) sensors have been identified in mammals. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple Ca(2+) sensors interact, rather than work autonomously, to produce the complex secretory response observed in neurons and secretory cells. In this review, we present several working models to describe how different sensors might be arranged to mediate synchronous, asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. We discuss the scenario that different Ca(2+) sensors typically act on one shared vesicle pool and compete for binding the multiple SNARE complexes that are likely to assemble at single vesicles, to exert both clamping and fusion-promoting functions.","Recent findings suggest that alterations in cholesterol homeostasis might be associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Although alterations in cholesterol content have been detected in cell models and several rodent models of HD, it is currently unclear what the potential mechanisms underlying cholesterol perturbations are. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether these observed changes in cholesterol homeostasis are involved in the pathogenesis of HD or occur as a secondary event. In this review, we provide an overview of current studies that have begun to address these issues and discuss recent findings suggesting that normal huntingtin protein might participate in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis. A better understanding of how alterations in cholesterol levels contribute to the pathophysiology of HD is likely to have significant therapeutic implications for the treatment of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.","It was suggested in 1986 that cue-induced drug craving in cocaine addicts progressively increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. During the past decade, investigators have identified an analogous incubation phenomenon in rodents, in which time-dependent increases in cue-induced drug seeking are observed after withdrawal from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Such an incubation of drug craving is not specific to cocaine, as similar findings have been observed after self-administration of heroin, nicotine, methamphetamine and alcohol in rats. In this review, we discuss recent results that have identified important brain regions involved in the incubation of drug craving, as well as evidence for the underlying cellular mechanisms. Understanding the neurobiology of the incubation of drug craving in rodents is likely to have significant implications for furthering understanding of brain mechanisms and circuits that underlie craving and relapse in human addicts.","It is becoming increasingly clear that members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family have roles in the central nervous system that extend beyond their well-established roles as neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. Recent findings have indicated that the TGF-β signaling pathways are involved in the modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the adult mammalian brain. In this review, we discuss how TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein and activin signaling at central synapses modulate synaptic plasticity, cognition and affective behavior. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the molecular understanding and potential treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety, depression and other neurological disorders.","Axons have evolved to acquire myelination, enabling denser packing and speedier transmission. Although myelin is considered a passive insulator, recent reports suggest a more dynamic role. Axons, in turn, are endowed with neurotransmitter release and uptake systems along their trunks. Based on these observations, I argue that there may exist a new type of chemical synapse between axon and myelin, one that supports activity-dependent communication between the two. This raises intriguing possibilities of dynamic fine-tuning of the myelin sheath even in adulthood, efficient recruitment of resources for myelin maintenance and bi-directional signaling, whereby the axon informs its myelinating cell of its metabolic needs proportionally to the electrical traffic it is transmitting. This would also have implications for de- and dysmyelinating diseases should this axo-myelinic synapse become dysfunctional.","Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a class of metabolic disorders caused by mutations in proteins critical for lysosomal function. Such proteins include lysosomal enzymes, lysosomal integral membrane proteins, and proteins involved in the post-translational modification and trafficking of lysosomal proteins. There are many recognized forms of LSDs and, although individually rare, their combined prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 8000 births. Over two-thirds of LSDs involve central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (progressive cognitive and motor decline) and these symptoms are often the most debilitating. Although the genetic basis for these disorders is clear and the biochemistry of the proteins well understood, the cellular mechanisms by which deficiencies in these proteins disrupt neuronal viability remain ambiguous. In this review, we provide an overview of the widespread cellular perturbations occurring in LSDs, how they might be linked and interventions that may specifically or globally correct those defects.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease. At the time of clinical manifestation of dementia, significant irreversible brain damage is already present, rendering the diagnosis of AD at early stages of the disease an urgent prerequisite for therapeutic treatment to halt, or at least slow, disease progression. In this review, we discuss various neuroimaging measures that are proving to have potential value as biomarkers of AD pathology for the detection and prediction of AD before the onset of dementia. Recent studies that have identified AD-like structural and functional brain changes in elderly people who are cognitively within the normal range or who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed. A dynamic sequence model of changes that occur in neuroimaging markers during the different disease stages is presented and the predictive value of multimodal neuroimaging for AD dementia is considered.","Many pathways important to the nervous system are regulated by the post-translational conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins. The reversal of ubiquitination, or deubiquitination, is equally critical to neuronal function. By countering protein ubiquitination, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) help control neuronal fate determination, axonal pathfinding and synaptic communication and plasticity. The significance of DUBs to the nervous system is underscored by links to various neurological diseases. Owing to cell type or substrate specificity, certain DUBs might also represent therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration. Here, we review recent findings that have shaped our current understanding of emerging functions for DUBs in the nervous system.","Misfolded TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and Fused-In-Sarcoma (FUS) protein have recently been identified as pathological hallmarks of the neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) characterized by the presence of ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Although TDP-43 and FUS are normally located predominantly in the nucleus, pathological TDP-43 and FUS inclusions are mostly found in the cytosol. Cytosolic deposition is paralleled by a striking nuclear depletion of either protein. Based on a number of recent findings, we postulate that defects in nuclear import are an important step towards TDP-43 and FUS dysfunction. Failure of nuclear transport can arise from mutations within a nuclear localization signal or from age-related decline of nuclear import mechanisms. We propose that nuclear import defects in combination with additional hits, for example cellular stress and genetic risk factors, may be a central underlying cause of ALS and FTLD-U pathology.","Although the addictive influence of tobacco was recognized very early, the modern concepts of nicotine addiction have relied on knowledge of cholinergic neurotransmission and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The discovery of the 'receptive substance' by Langley, that would turn out to be nAChRs, and 'Vagusstoff' (acetylcholine) by Loewi, coincided with an exciting time when the concept of chemical synaptic transmission was being formulated. More recently, the application of more powerful techniques and the study of animal models that replicate key features of nicotine dependence have led to important advancements in our understanding of molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of nicotine addiction. In this review, we present a historical perspective and overview of the research that has led to our present understanding of nicotine addiction.","The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the master circadian pacemaker in mammals. The individual cells of the SCN are capable of functioning independently from one another and therefore must form a cohesive circadian network through intercellular coupling. The network properties of the SCN lead to coordination of circadian rhythms among its neurons and neuronal subpopulations. There is increasing evidence for multiple interconnected oscillators within the SCN, and in this review we will highlight recent advances in our knowledge of the complex organization and function of the cellular and network-level SCN clock. Understanding the way in which synchrony is achieved between cells in the SCN will provide insight into the means by which this important nucleus orchestrates circadian rhythms throughout the organism.","Rapid communication in the brain relies on the release and diffusion of small transmitter molecules across the synaptic cleft. How these diffuse signals are transformed into cellular responses is determined by the scatter of target postsynaptic receptors, which in turn depends on receptor movement in cell membranes. Thus, by shaping information transfer in neural circuits, mechanisms that regulate molecular mobility affect nearly every aspect of brain function and dysfunction. Here we review two facets of molecular mobility that have traditionally been considered separately, namely extracellular and intra-membrane diffusion. By focusing on the interplay between these processes we illustrate the remarkable versatility of signal formation in synapses and highlight areas of emerging understanding in the molecular physiology and biophysics of synaptic transmission.","Neurons communicate with one another at specialized contact sites called synapses, composed of pre- and postsynaptic compartments. Presynaptic compartments, or 'boutons', signal to the postsynaptic compartment by releasing chemical neurotransmitter in response to incoming electrical impulses. Recent studies link defects in the function of presynaptic boutons to the etiology of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we describe five core functions of presynaptic boutons and the molecules that mediate these functions, focusing on a subset that are linked to human disease. We also discuss potential mechanisms through which the loss or alteration of these specific molecules could lead to defects in synaptic communication, neural circuit function and, ultimately, cognition and behavior.","Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe genetic disorder caused by mutations or deletions of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene. UBE3A encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is expressed biallelically in most tissues but is maternally expressed in almost all neurons. In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the expression and function of UBE3A in the brain and the etiology of AS. We highlight current AS model systems, epigenetic mechanisms of UBE3A regulation, and the identification of potential UBE3A substrates in the brain. In the process, we identify major gaps in our knowledge that, if bridged, could move us closer to identifying treatments for this debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder.","Pavlovian fear conditioning depends on synaptic plasticity at amygdala neurons. Here, we review recent electrophysiological, molecular and behavioral evidence suggesting the existence of a distributed neural circuitry regulating amygdala synaptic plasticity during fear learning. This circuitry, which involves projections from the midbrain periaqueductal gray region, can be linked to prediction error and expectation modulation of fear learning, as described by associative and computational learning models. It controls whether, and how much, fear learning occurs by signaling aversive events when they are unexpected. Functional neuroimaging and clinical studies indicate that this prediction circuit is recruited in humans during fear learning and contributes to exposure-based treatments for clinical anxiety. This aversive prediction error circuit might represent a conserved mechanism for regulating fear learning in mammals.","The endocannabinoid system consists of G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors that can be activated by cannabis-derived drugs and small lipids termed endocannabinoids (eCBs) plus associated biochemical machinery (precursors, synthetic and degradative enzymes, transporters). The eCB system in the brain primarily influences neuronal synaptic communication, and affects biological functions - including eating, anxiety, learning and memory, growth and development - via an array of actions throughout the nervous system. Although many aspects of synaptic regulation by eCBs are becoming clear, details of the subcellular organization and regulation of the eCB system are less well understood. This review focuses on recent investigations that illuminate fundamental issues of eCB storage, release, and functional roles.","The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors has recently emerged as a major regulator of the growth and elaboration of neural processes. NF-κB signaling has been implicated in controlling axon initiation, elongation, guidance and branching and in regulating dendrite arbor size and complexity during development and dendritic spine density in the adult. NF-κB is activated by a variety of extracellular signals, and either promotes or inhibits growth depending on the phosphorylation status of the p65 NF-κB subunit. These novel roles for NF-κB, together with recent evidence implicating NF-κB in the regulation of neurogenesis in the embryo and adult, have important implications for neural development and for learning and memory in the mature nervous system.","Structure-function studies of neuronal networks have recently benefited from considerable progress in different areas of investigation. Advances in molecular genetics and imaging have allowed for the dissection of neuronal connectivity with unprecedented detail whereas in vivo recordings are providing much needed clues as to how sensory, motor and cognitive function is encoded in neuronal firing. However, bridging the gap between the cellular and behavioral levels will ultimately require an understanding of the functional organization of the underlying neuronal circuits. One way to unravel the complexity of neuronal networks is to understand how their connectivity emerges during brain maturation. In this review, we will describe how graph theory provides experimentalists with novel concepts that can be used to describe and interpret these developing connectivity schemes.","Transmitter release at synapses is driven by elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) near the sites of vesicle fusion. [Ca(2+)](i) signals of profoundly different amplitude and kinetics drive the phasic release component during a presynaptic action potential, and asynchronous release at later times. Studies using direct control of [Ca(2+)](i) at a large glutamatergic terminal, the calyx of Held, have provided significant insight into how intracellular Ca(2+) regulates transmitter release over a wide concentration range. Synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2), the major isoform of the Syt1/2 Ca(2+) sensors at these synapses, triggers highly Ca(2+)-cooperative release above 1μM [Ca(2+)](i), but suppresses release at low [Ca(2+)](i). Thus, neurons utilize a highly sophisticated release apparatus to maximize the dynamic range of Ca(2+)-evoked versus spontaneous release.","Postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are crucial for many aspects of brain function, including learning, memory and cognition. The number, synaptic localization and subunit composition of synaptic AMPARs are tightly regulated by network activity and by the history of activity at individual synapses. Furthermore, aberrant AMPAR trafficking is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. AMPARs therefore represent a prime target for drug development and the mechanisms that control their synaptic delivery, retention and removal are the subject of extensive research. Here, we review recent findings that have provided new insights into AMPAR trafficking and that might lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of innate immune system receptors that respond to pathogen-derived and tissue damage-related ligands. TLR signaling in immune cells, glia and neurons can play roles in the pathogenesis of stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent findings suggest that TLR signaling also influences multiple dynamic processes in the developing and adult central nervous system including neurogenesis, axonal growth and structural plasticity. In addition, TLRs are implicated in the regulation of behaviors including learning, memory and anxiety. This review describes recently discovered and unexpected roles for TLRs in neuroplasticity, and the implications of these findings for future basic and translational research studies.","The central complex of the insect brain is a remarkably miniaturized but highly complex multimodal information-processing network. Recent work on central complex development in Drosophila and grasshopper reveals that the cells comprising its complex circuitry are generated by a surprisingly small number of primary progenitors. Of these, four identified neural stem cells generate a large number of neurons through a novel mode of neurogenesis that involves self-renewing intermediate progenitor cells. Interestingly, a comparable mode of amplification of proliferation also operates in the developing mammalian cortex; this could be a general strategy for increasing brain size and complexity. Although this type of proliferation generates a large number of progeny, it is also prone to dysregulation, resulting in brain tumors. Thus, furthering our knowledge of the development of the central complex is likely to be valuable not only for understanding brain complexity but could also have important implications for identifying developmental pathways that go awry during tumor formation.","Attention exhibits characteristic neural signatures in brain regions that process sensory signals. An important area of future research is to understand the nature of top-down signals that facilitate attentional guidance towards behaviorally relevant locations and features. In this review, we discuss recent studies that have made progress towards understanding: (i) the brain structures and circuits involved in attentional allocation; (ii) top-down attention pathways, particularly as elucidated by microstimulation and lesion studies; (iii) top-down modulatory influences involving subcortical structures and reward systems; (iv) plausible substrates and embodiments of top-down signals; and (v) information processing and theoretical constraints that might be helpful in guiding future experiments. Understanding top-down attention is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms by which we can filter sensory information to pay attention to the most behaviorally relevant events.","Synapses are the fundamental units of neuronal circuits. Synaptic plasticity can occur through changes in synaptic strength, as well as through the addition/removal of synapses. Two-photon microscopy in combination with fluorescence labeling offers a powerful tool to peek into the living brain and follow structural reorganization at individual synapses. Time-lapse imaging depicts a dynamic picture in which experience-dependent plasticity of synaptic structures varies between different cortical regions and layers, as well as between neuronal subtypes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the formation and elimination of synaptic structures happens rapidly in a subpopulation of cortical neurons during various sensorimotor learning experiences, and that stabilized synaptic structures are associated with long lasting memories for the task. Therefore, circuit plasticity, mediated by structural remodeling, provides an underlying mechanism for learning and memory.","Glucocorticoids can acutely affect memory processes, with both facilitating and impairing effects having been described. Recent work has revealed that glucocorticoids may affect learning and memory processes by interacting with glutamatergic mechanisms. In this opinion article I describe different glutamatergic pathways that glucocorticoids can affect to modulate memory processes. Furthermore, glucocorticoid-glutamatergic interactions during information processing are proposed as a potential model to explain many of the diverse actions of glucocorticoids on cognition. The model suggests that direct modulation of glutamatergic pathways by glucocorticoids could serve as an important mechanism for these hormones to directly alter cognitive functions.","Recent studies indicate that single-action-single-target agents are unlikely to cure CNS disorders sharing a pathogenic triad consisting of vascular damage, neuronal injury/neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Here we focus on a recent example of a multiple-action-multiple-target approach for CNS disorders based on newly discovered biological properties of activated protein C (APC), an endogenous plasma protease with antithrombotic, cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities in the CNS. We propose that APC-mediated signaling through the protease activated receptor-1 (PAR1) can favorably regulate multiple pathways within the neurovascular unit in non-neuronal cells and neurons during acute or chronic CNS insults, leading to stabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neuroprotection and control of neuroinflammation. Although much remains to be understood regarding the biology of APC, preclinical studies suggest that APC has promising applications as disease-modifying therapy for ischemic stroke and other neuropathologies whose underlying pathology involves deficits in the vasculo-neuronal-inflammatory triad.","Benzodiazepines are widely used clinically to treat anxiety and insomnia. They also induce muscle relaxation, control epileptic seizures, and can produce amnesia. Moreover, benzodiazepines are often abused after chronic clinical treatment and also for recreational purposes. Within weeks, tolerance to the pharmacological effects can develop as a sign of dependence. In vulnerable individuals with compulsive drug use, addiction will be diagnosed. Here we review recent observations from animal models regarding the cellular and molecular basis that might underlie the addictive properties of benzodiazepines. These data reveal how benzodiazepines, acting through specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes, activate midbrain dopamine neurons, and how this could hijack the mesolimbic reward system. Such findings have important implications for the future design of benzodiazepines with reduced or even absent addiction liability.","Cell replacement therapy has been proposed as a means to replace lost dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). In most studies, the transplanted cells have been placed within the target site, the striatum, and not within the lesioned site, the substantia nigra, as the adult nigrostriatal pathway was thought to constitute a non-permissive environment for long distance axonal outgrowth of transplanted neuroblasts. Here, we discuss recent findings showing that intranigral transplanted dopaminergic neuroblasts can form axonal projections to the striatum, resulting in increased striatal dopamine levels and ameliorating behavioral deficits in animal models of PD. Such findings have raised new hopes and opened new avenues for cell replacement therapy in patients with PD.","Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and is thought to arise from genetic anomalies in developmental pathways required for the normal maturation of the cerebellar cortex, notably developmental pathways for granule cell progenitor (GCP) neurogenesis. Over the past decade, a wide range of studies have identified genes and their regulators within signaling pathways, as well as noncoding RNAs, that have crucial roles in both normal cerebellar development and pathogenesis. These include the Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, bone morphogenic proteins (Bmp) and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathways. In this review, we highlight the function of these pathways in the growth of the cerebellum and the formation of MB. A better understanding of the developmental origins of these tumors will have significant implications for enhancing the treatment of this important childhood cancer.","Slitrks are a family of structurally related transmembrane proteins belonging to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily. Six family members exist (Slitrk1-6) and all are highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Slitrks have been implicated in mediating basic neuronal processes, ranging from neurite outgrowth and dendritic elaboration to neuronal survival. Recent studies in humans and genetic mouse models have led to the identification of Slitrks as candidate genes that might be involved in the development of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive compulsive spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Although these system-level approaches have suggested that Slitrks play prominent roles in CNS development, key questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms through which they mediate neuronal signaling and connectivity.","Two decades have passed since the first report of the cloning of a kainate-type glutamate receptor (KAR) subunit. The intervening years have seen a rapid growth in our understanding of the biophysical properties and function of KARs in the brain. This research has led to an appreciation that KARs play very distinct roles at synapses relative to other members of the glutamate-gated ion channel receptor family, despite structural and functional commonalities. The surprisingly diverse and complex nature of KAR signaling underlies their unique impact upon neuronal networks through their direct and indirect effects on synaptic transmission, and their prominent role in regulating cell excitability. This review pieces together highlights from the two decades of research subsequent to the cloning of the first subunit, and provides an overview of our current understanding of the role of KARs in the CNS and their potential importance to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.","Humans and other animals can attend to one of multiple sounds and follow it selectively over time. The neural underpinnings of this perceptual feat remain mysterious. Some studies have concluded that sounds are heard as separate streams when they activate well-separated populations of central auditory neurons, and that this process is largely pre-attentive. Here, we argue instead that stream formation depends primarily on temporal coherence between responses that encode various features of a sound source. Furthermore, we postulate that only when attention is directed towards a particular feature (e.g. pitch) do all other temporally coherent features of that source (e.g. timbre and location) become bound together as a stream that is segregated from the incoherent features of other sources.","In recent years, previously unsuspected roles of astrocytes have been revealed, largely owing to the development of new tools enabling their selective study in situ. These exciting findings add to the large body of evidence demonstrating that astrocytes play a central role in brain homeostasis, in particular via the numerous cooperative metabolic processes they establish with neurons, such as the supply of energy metabolites and neurotransmitter recycling functions. Furthermore, impairments in astrocytic function are increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to neuronal dysfunction and, in particular, neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we discuss recent evidence supporting important roles for astrocytes in neuropathological conditions such as neuroinflammation, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. We also explore the potential for neuroprotective therapeutics based on the modulation of astrocytic functions.","Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) extract signals from neural activity to control remote devices ranging from computer cursors to limb-like robots. They show great potential to help patients with severe motor deficits perform everyday tasks without the constant assistance of caregivers. Understanding the neural mechanisms by which subjects use BCI systems could lead to improved designs and provide unique insights into normal motor control and skill acquisition. However, reports vary considerably about how much training is required to use a BCI system, the degree to which performance improves with practice and the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines these diverse findings, their potential relationship with motor learning during overt arm movements, and other outstanding questions concerning the volitional control of BCI systems.","GABA(A) receptors in the CNS mediate both fast synaptic and tonic inhibition. Over the past decade a phasic current with features intermediate between fast synaptic and tonic inhibition, termed GABA(A,slow), has received increasing attention. This has coincided with an ever-growing appreciation for GABAergic cell type diversity. Compared with classical fast synaptic inhibition, GABA(A,slow) is slower by an order of magnitude. In this review, we summarize recent studies that have enhanced our understanding of GABA(A,slow). These include the discovery of specialized interneuron types from which this current originates, the factors that could underlie its characteristically slow kinetics, its contribution to specific aspects of integrative function and network oscillations, and its potential usefulness as a novel drug target for modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CNS.","No therapy exists to slow down or prevent Parkinson's disease (PD), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) emerged as promising disease-modifying agents in PD and are currently under clinical development. We argue that efforts in three research areas must converge to harness the full therapeutic power of NTFs. First, the physiological roles of NTFs in aging dopaminergic neurons must be comprehensively understood. Second, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective, neurorestorative and stimulatory effects of NTFs on diseased neurons need to be defined. Third, improved brain delivery of NTFs and new ways to stimulate NTF signaling are required to achieve clinical benefits. In this review, we discuss progress in these areas and highlight emerging concepts in NTF biology and therapy.","Neuron types are classically defined by anatomical and physiological properties that determine how synaptic inputs are integrated. Here, we provide an overview of the evidence that, among neurons of a single type, integration of synaptic responses is further tuned according to the particular function that individual neurons carry out. Recent data suggest that tuning of synaptic responses is not restricted to sensory pathways, but extends to cognitive and motor circuits. We propose that tuning of synaptic integration results from general cellular mechanisms for optimization of information processing that are distinct from, but complementary to, homeostasis and memory storage. These cellular tuning mechanisms might be crucial for distributed computations underlying sensory, motor and cognitive functions.","Callosal projection neurons (CPN) are a diverse population of neocortical projection neurons that connect the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex via the corpus callosum. They play key roles in high-level associative connectivity, and have been implicated in cognitive syndromes of high-level associative dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorders. CPN evolved relatively recently compared to other cortical neuron populations, and have undergone disproportionately large expansion from mouse to human. While much is known about the anatomical trajectory of developing CPN axons, and progress has been made in identifying cellular and molecular controls over midline crossing, only recently have molecular-genetic controls been identified that specify CPN populations, and help define CPN subpopulations. In this review, we discuss the development, diversity and evolution of CPN.","The current definition of major depressive disorder (MDD) emerged from efforts to create reliable diagnostic criteria for clinical and research use. However, despite decades of research, the neurobiology of MDD is largely unknown, and treatments are no more effective today than they were 50-70 years ago. Here, we propose that the current conception of depression is misguiding basic and clinical research. Redefinition is necessary and could include a focus on a more narrowly defined set of core symptoms. However, we conclude that depression is better defined as the tendency to enter into, and inability to disengage from, a negative mood state rather than the mood state per se. We also discuss the implications of this revised definition for future clinical and basic research.","Ghrelin is a peptide hormone produced and secreted in the stomach. Numerous studies over the past decade demonstrate its importance in food intake, body-weight regulation and glucose homeostasis. These effects are driven largely by the high expression of the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) in the hypothalamus. However, GHSR1a is also expressed in numerous extra-hypothalamic neuronal populations, suggesting that ghrelin has physiological functions besides those involved in metabolic functions. In this review, I focus on increasing evidence that ghrelin has important roles in extra-hypothalamic functions, including learning and memory, reward and motivation, anxiety and depression, and neuroprotection. Furthermore, I discuss how the recently demonstrated role of ghrelin in promoting survival during periods of caloric restriction could contribute to its inherent neuroprotective and neuromodulatory properties.","Although slow wave activity in the EEG has been linked to homeostatic sleep regulation, the neurobiological substrate of sleep homeostasis is not well understood. Whereas cortical neurons typically exhibit reduced discharge rates during slow wave sleep (SWS), a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, which express the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), has recently been found to be activated during SWS. The extent of activation of these nNOS neurons is proportional to homeostatic sleep 'drive'. These cells are an exception among cortical interneurons in that they are projection neurons. We propose that cortical nNOS neurons are positioned to influence neuronal activity across widespread brain areas. They could thus provide a long-sought anatomical link for understanding homeostatic sleep regulation.","In mammals, new neurons are recruited into restricted brain areas throughout life. Adult-born neurons produced in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle migrate rostrally towards the olfactory bulb. Although thousands of neurons reach this central structure every day, the functional impact of their integration into mature circuits remains a matter of debate. Recent investigations have revealed no striking sensory deficits per se when adult bulbar neurogenesis is challenged. However, some cognitive functions, such as perceptual learning and olfactory memory, are clearly impaired. In this review we highlight the role of network activity in shaping ongoing neurogenesis and, in turn, how the integration of adult-born neurons refines pre-existing network function, and consequently olfactory behavior.","Multiple neural pathways and molecular mechanisms responsible for producing the sensation of itch have recently been identified, including histamine-independent pathways. Physiological, molecular, behavioral and brain imaging studies are converging on a description of these pathways and their close association with pain processing. Some conflicting results have arisen and the precise relationship between itch and pain remains controversial. A better understanding of the generation of itch and of the intrinsic mechanisms that inhibit itch after scratching should facilitate the search for new methods to alleviate clinical pruritus (itch). In this review we describe the current understanding of the production and inhibition of itch. A model of itch processing within the CNS is proposed.","In this review, we consider the evidence that a reduction in neurogenesis underlies aging-related cognitive deficits and impairments in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The molecular and cellular alterations associated with impaired neurogenesis in the aging brain are discussed. Dysfunction of presenilin-1, misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein and toxic effects of hyperphosphorylated tau and β-amyloid probably contribute to impaired neurogenesis in AD. Because factors such as exercise, environmental enrichment and dietary energy restriction enhance neurogenesis, and protect against age-related cognitive decline and AD, knowledge of the underlying neurogenic signaling pathways could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for preserving brain function. In addition, manipulation of endogenous neural stem cells and stem cell transplantation, as stand-alone or adjunct treatments, seems promising.","α-Synuclein is central to the Lewy body neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor manifestations. The cardinal motor symptoms are linked to death of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Here we ask why these neurons are preferentially susceptible to neurodegeneration in PD and how α-synuclein is involved. To address these questions we bring together recent findings from genome-wide association studies, which reveal the involvement of α-synuclein gene variants in sporadic PD, with recent studies highlighting important roles for α-synuclein in synaptic transmission and dopaminergic neuron physiology. These latest advances add to our understanding of PD etiology and provide a central link between the genetic findings and neurodegeneration observed in sporadic PD.","Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular pathway involved in the elimination of proteins and organelles by lysosomes. Known originally as an adaptive response to nutrient deprivation in mitotic cells, autophagy is now recognized as an arbiter of neuronal survival and death decisions in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies using postmortem human tissue, genetic and toxin-induced animal and cellular models indicate that many of the etiological factors associated with neurodegenerative disorders can perturb the autophagy process. Emerging data support the view that dysregulation of autophagy might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we highlight the pathophysiological roles of autophagy and its potential therapeutic implications in debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.","Anatomical and functional studies of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have identified multiple PFC subregions. We argue that the PFC is involved in cognitive functions exceeding the sum of specific functions attributed to its subregions. These can be revealed either by lesions of the whole PFC, or more specifically by selective disconnection of the PFC from certain types of information (for example, visual) allowing the investigation of PFC function in toto. Recent studies in macaque monkeys using the latter approach lead to a second conclusion: that the PFC, as a whole, could be fundamentally specialized for representing events that are extended in time. The representation of temporally complex events might underlie PFC involvement in general intelligence, decision-making, and executive function.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2011 Mar;34(3):113.,Nervous system development proceeds by sequential gene expression mediated by cascades of transcription factors in parallel with sequences of patterned network activity driven by receptors and ion channels. These sequences are cell type- and developmental stage-dependent and modulated by paracrine actions of substances released by neurons and glia. How and to what extent these sequences interact to enable neuronal network development is not understood. Recent evidence demonstrates that CNS development requires intermediate stages of differentiation providing functional feedback that influences gene expression. We suggest that embryonic neuronal functions constitute a series of phenotypic checkpoint signatures; neurons failing to express these functions are delayed or developmentally arrested. Such checkpoints are likely to be a general feature of neuronal development and constitute presymptomatic signatures of neurological disorders when they go awry.,"Investigations of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) demonstrate neuronal dysfunction long before the onset of classical disease indicators. Similarly, recent human studies reveal synaptic dysfunction decades before predicted clinical diagnosis in HD gene carriers. These studies guide premanifest tracking of disease and the development of treatment assessment tools. New discoveries of mechanisms underlying early neuronal dysfunction, including elevated pathogenic extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling, reduced synaptic connectivity and loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) support have led to pharmacological interventions that can reverse or delay phenotype onset and disease progression in HD mice. Further understanding the primary effects of gene mutations associated with late-onset neurodegeneration should translate to novel treatments for HD families and guide therapeutic strategies for other neurodegenerative diseases.","Covalent modifications of intracellular proteins, such as phosphorylation, are generally thought to occur as secondary or tertiary responses to neurotransmitters, following the intermediation of membrane receptors and second messengers such as cyclic AMP. By contrast, the gasotransmitter nitric oxide directly S-nitrosylates cysteine residues in diverse intracellular proteins. Recently, hydrogen sulfide has been acknowledged as a gasotransmitter, which analogously sulfhydrates cysteine residues in proteins. Cysteine residues are also modified by palmitoylation in response to neurotransmitter signaling, possibly in reciprocity with S-nitrosylation. Neurotransmission also elicits sumoylation and acetylation of lysine residues within diverse proteins. This review addresses how these recently appreciated protein modifications impact our thinking about ways in which neurotransmission regulates intracellular protein disposition.","The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the central nervous system is well recognized as a migration and diffusion barrier that allows for the trapping and presentation of growth factors to their receptors at the cell surface. Recent data highlight the importance of ECM molecules as synaptic and perisynaptic scaffolds that direct the clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic compartment and that present barriers to reduce the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins away from synapses. The ECM also contributes to the migration and differentiation of stem cells in the neurogenic niche and organizes the polarized localization of ion channels and transporters at contacts between astrocytic processes and blood vessels. Thus, the ECM contributes to functional compartmentalization in the brain.","As any new parent knows, having a baby provides opportunities for enrichment, learning and stress - experiences known to change the adult brain. Yet surprisingly little is known about the effects of maternal experience, and even less about the effects of paternal experience, on neural circuitry not directly involved in parenting. Here we discuss how caregiving and the accompanying experiential and hormonal changes influence the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, brain regions involved in cognition and mood regulation. A better understanding of how parenting impacts the brain is likely to help in devising strategies for treating parental depression, a condition that can have serious cognitive and mental health consequences for children.","Functional stereotaxy was introduced in the late 1940s to reduce the morbidity of lobotomy in psychiatric disease by using more focal lesions. The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to DBS treatment.","A goal of memory research is to understand how changing the weight of specific synapses in neural circuits in the brain leads to an appropriate learned behavioral response. Finding the relevant synapses should allow investigators to probe the underlying physiological and molecular operations that encode memories and permit their retrieval. In this review I discuss recent work in Drosophila that implicates specific subsets of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in aversive reinforcement and appetitive motivation. The zonal architecture of these DA neurons is likely to reveal the functional organization of aversive and appetitive memory in the mushroom bodies. Combinations of fly DA neurons might code negative and positive value, consistent with a motivational systems role as proposed in mammals.","Neuron-type specific gene batteries define the morphological and functional diversity of cell types in the nervous system. Here, we discuss the composition of neuron-type specific gene batteries and illustrate gene regulatory strategies which determine the unique gene expression profiles and molecular composition of individual neuronal cell types from C. elegans to higher vertebrates. Based on principles learned from prokaryotic gene regulation, we argue that neuronal terminal gene batteries are functionally grouped into parallel-acting 'regulons'. The theoretical concepts discussed here provide testable hypotheses for future experimental analysis of the exact gene-regulatory mechanisms employed in the generation of neuronal diversity and identity.","Enteric nervous system (ENS) development is relevant to Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR; congenital aganglionosis of the terminal bowel), which is still imperfectly treated. Mutations in genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are involved in HSCR pathogenesis; however, also important in ENS development are molecules that mediate events that are more restricted than those of RET and EDNRB, act later in development and which might not be HSCR-associated. Examples are molecules that function in the guidance of enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) and vagal axons, and in regulating the terminal differentiation of enteric neurons from ENCDCs. It is probable that highly prevalent disorders of gastrointestinal sensation and motility result from subtle defects in ENS development.","The voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. Structurally, BK channels are homologous to voltage- and ligand-gated K(+) channels, having a voltage sensor and pore as the membrane-spanning domain and a cytosolic domain containing metal binding sites. Recently published electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallographic structures of the BK channel provided the first glimpse into the assembly of these domains, corroborating the close interactions among these domains during channel gating that have been suggested by functional studies. This review discusses these latest findings and an emerging new understanding about BK channel gating and implications for diseases such as epilepsy, in which mutations in BK channel genes have been associated.","Activation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens is critical for goal-directed behaviors including cocaine seeking. Studies in cocaine-experienced rodents have revealed three major categories of neuroadaptations that influence the ability of glutamate inputs to activate MSNs: changes in synaptic AMPA receptor levels, changes in extracellular non-synaptic glutamate levels and changes in MSN intrinsic membrane excitability. Most studies have focused on one of these adaptations. This review will consider the possibility that they are causally related and speculate about how time-dependent changes in their interactions may regulate MSN output during early and late withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure.","Recent studies of the iconic fall migration of monarch butterflies have illuminated the mechanisms behind their southward navigation while using a time-compensated sun compass. Skylight cues, such as the sun itself and polarized light, are processed through both eyes and are probably integrated in the brain's central complex, the presumed site of the sun compass. Time compensation is provided by circadian clocks that have a distinctive molecular mechanism and that reside in the antennae. Monarchs might also use a magnetic compass because they possess two cryptochromes that have the molecular capability for light-dependent magnetoreception. Multiple genomic approaches are now being used with the aim of identifying navigation genes. Monarch butterflies are thus emerging as an excellent model organism in which to study the molecular and neural basis of long-distance migration.","Reelin controls the migration of neurons and layer formation during brain development. However, recent studies have shown that disrupting Reelin function in the adult hippocampus induces repositioning of fully differentiated neurons, suggesting a stabilizing effect of Reelin on mature neuronal circuitry. Indeed, Reelin was recently found to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton by inducing cofilin phosphorylation. When unphosphorylated, cofilin acts as an actin-depolymerizing protein that promotes the disassembly of F-actin. Here, a novel hypothesis is proposed whereby decreased Reelin expression in the mature brain causes destabilization of neurons and their processes, leading to aberrant plasticity and aberrant wiring of brain circuitry. This has implications for brain disorders, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia, in which deficiencies in Reelin expression occur.","Serotonin is an important neuromodulator associated with a wide range of physiological effects in the central nervous system. The exact mechanisms whereby serotonin influences brain development are not well understood, although studies in invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms are beginning to unravel a regulatory role for serotonin in neuronal morphology and circuit formation. Recent data suggest a developmental window during which altered serotonin levels permanently influence neuronal circuitry, however, the temporal constraints and molecular mechanisms responsible are still under investigation. Growing evidence suggests that alterations in early serotonin signaling contribute to a number of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, understanding how altered serotonin signaling affects neuronal morphology and plasticity, and ultimately animal physiology and pathophysiology, will be of great significance.","How is the prefrontal cortex (PFC) organized such that it is capable of making people more flexible and in control of their behavior? Is there any systematic organization across the many diverse areas that comprise the PFC, or is it uniquely adaptive such that no fixed representational structure can develop? Going against the current tide, this paper argues that there is indeed a systematic organization across PFC areas, with an important functional distinction between ventral and dorsal regions characterized as processing What versus How information, respectively. This distinction has implications for the rostro-caudal and medial-lateral axes of organization as well. The resulting large-scale functional map of PFC could prove useful in integrating diverse data, and in generating novel predictions.","Scores of compounds ameliorate cognitive deficits or neuropathology in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet these triumphs in mice have not translated into successful therapies for people. Why have studies in mice failed to predict results of human trials? We argue that most transgenic mouse 'models of AD' actually simulate the asymptomatic phase of the disease, and the results of interventional studies in these mice should be considered in the context of disease prevention. In addition, recent advances in imaging technology and biomarker discovery should aid in comparisons of mouse and human neurological status and, importantly, might allow us to predict better the response of people to drugs tested in mice.","The thalamus is a central brain region that plays a crucial role in distributing incoming sensory information to appropriate regions of the cortex. The thalamus develops in the posterior part of the embryonic forebrain, where early cell fate decisions are controlled by a local signaling center - the mid-diencephalic organizer - which forms at the boundary between prospective prethalamus and thalamus. In this review we discuss recent observations of early thalamic development in zebrafish, chick, and mouse embryos, that reveal a conserved set of interactions between homeodomain transcription factors. These interactions position the organizer along the neuraxis. The most prominent of the organizer's signals, Sonic hedgehog, is necessary for conferring regional identity on the prethalamus and thalamus and for patterning their differentiation.","In the past decades, a range of post-translational modifications has been discovered on tubulins, the major constituents of microtubules. Pioneering studies have described the occurrence and dynamics of these modifications and provided first insights into their potential functions in regulating the microtubule cytoskeleton. By contrast, several tubulin-modifying enzymes were only discovered in the last few years, and studies on molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of tubulin modifications are just beginning to emerge. This review highlights the roles of tubulin modifications in neurons. Recent studies are also discussed in relation to how the combinatorial use of tubulin modifications could generate a dynamic microtubule code, and how such a code might regulate basic as well as higher-order neuronal functions.","LINE-1 (L1) elements are retrotransposons that insert extra copies of themselves throughout the genome using a 'copy and paste' mechanism. L1s comprise nearly approximately 20% of the human genome and are able to influence chromosome integrity and gene expression upon reinsertion. Recent studies show that L1 elements are active and 'jumping' during neuronal differentiation. New somatic L1 insertions could generate 'genomic plasticity' in neurons by causing variation in genomic DNA sequences and by altering the transcriptome of individual cells. Thus, L1-induced variation could affect neuronal plasticity and behavior. We discuss potential consequences of L1-induced neuronal diversity and propose that a mechanism for generating diversity in the brain could broaden the spectrum of behavioral phenotypes that can originate from any single genome.","The most common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are characterized by the misfolding of a small number of proteins that assemble into ordered aggregates in affected brain cells. For many years, the events leading to aggregate formation were believed to be entirely cell-autonomous, with protein misfolding occurring independently in many cells. Recent research has now shown that cell non-autonomous mechanisms are also important for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases with intracellular filamentous inclusions. The intercellular transfer of inclusions made of tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin and superoxide dismutase 1 has been demonstrated, revealing the existence of mechanisms reminiscent of those by which prions spread through the nervous system.","To understand gustatory physiology and associated dysfunctions it is important to know how oral taste stimuli are encoded both in the periphery and in taste-related brain centres. The identification of distinct taste receptors, together with electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assessments in response to taste stimuli, suggest that information about distinct taste modalities (e.g. sweet versus bitter) are transmitted from the periphery to the brain via segregated pathways. By contrast, gustatory neurons throughout the brain are more broadly tuned, indicating that ensembles of neurons encode taste qualities. Recent evidence reviewed here suggests that the coding of gustatory stimuli is not immutable, but is dependant on a variety of factors including appetite-regulating molecules and associative learning.","Active transport along the axon is crucial to the neuron. Motor-driven transport supplies the distal synapse with newly synthesized proteins and lipids, and clears damaged or misfolded proteins. Microtubule motors also drive long-distance signaling along the axon via signaling endosomes. Although positive signaling initiated by neurotrophic factors has been well-studied, recent research has focused on stress-signaling along the axon. Here, the connections between axonal transport alterations and neurodegeneration are discussed, including evidence for defective transport of vesicles, mitochondria, degradative organelles, and signaling endosomes in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Defects in transport are sufficient to induce neurodegeneration, but recent progress suggests that changes in retrograde signaling pathways correlate with rapidly progressive neuronal cell death.","Endogenous neurosteroids and their synthetic analogs (neuroactive steroids) are potent modulators of GABA(A) receptors. Thus, they are of physiological and clinical relevance for their ability to modulate inhibitory function in the CNS. Despite their importance, fundamental issues of neurosteroid actions remain unresolved. Recent evidence suggests that glutamatergic principal neurons, rather than glia, are the major sources of neurosteroid synthesis. Other recent studies have identified putative neurosteroid binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. In this Opinion, we argue that neurosteroids require a membranous route of access to transmembrane-domain binding sites within GABA(A) receptors. This has implications for the design of future neuroactive steroids because the lipid solubility and related accessibility properties of the ligand are likely to be key determinants of receptor modulation.",Dendritic ion channels are essential for the regulation of intrinsic excitability as well as modulating the shape and integration of synaptic signals. Changes in dendritic channel function have been associated with many forms of synaptic plasticity. Recent evidence suggests that dendritic ion channel modulation and trafficking could contribute to plasticity-induced alterations in neuronal function. In this review we discuss our current knowledge of dendritic ion channel modulation and trafficking and their relationship to cellular and synaptic plasticity. We also consider the implications for neuronal function. We argue that to gain an insight into neuronal information processing it is essential to understand the regulation of dendritic ion channel expression and properties.,"A large number of human diseases are caused by expansion of repeat sequences - typically trinucleotide repeats - within the respective disease genes. The abnormally expanded sequence can lead to a variety of effects on the gene: sometimes the gene is silenced, but in many cases the expanded repeat sequences confer toxicity to the mRNA and, in the case of polyglutamine diseases, to the encoded protein. This article highlights mechanisms by which the mRNAs with abnormally expanded repeats can confer toxicity leading to neuronal dysfunction and loss. Greater understanding of these mechanisms will provide the foundation for therapeutic advances for this set of human disorders.","The release probability, the average probability that an active zone of a presynaptic terminal releases one or more vesicles following an action potential, is tightly regulated. Measurements in cultured neurons or in slices indicate that this probability can vary greatly between synapses, but on average it is estimated to be as high as 0.5. In vivo, however, the size of synaptic potentials is relatively independent of recent history, suggesting that release probability is much lower. Possible causes for this discrepancy include maturational differences, a higher spontaneous activity, a lower extracellular calcium concentration and more prominent tonic inhibition by ambient neurotransmitters during in vivo recordings. Existing evidence thus suggests that under physiological conditions in vivo, presynaptic action potentials trigger the release of neurotransmitter much less frequently than what is observed in in vitro preparations.","Sex differences exist in brain function and behavior. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only beginning to emerge. Recent studies in rodents have revealed molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in memory formation. It is becoming clear that sex differences are not simply reflective of differences in sex hormones, but also reflect distinctions in synaptic signaling mechanisms including the role of synaptic kinases. Furthermore, there are sex differences in the activation of transcription factors and gene transcription during memory formation. This review discusses emerging evidence in the field and how these findings are providing a first step towards a molecular understanding of how sex differences impact on memory formation both in health and disease.","Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated intrinsic activity in the brain during the resting state. The concept of the default-mode network (DMN) - a set of brain regions in which resting-state activity (RSA) activity is reduced in response to external stimuli - recently raised much controversy concerning the psychological correlates of RSA. However, it remains unclear how RSA interacts with stimulus-induced activity. Here we review studies in humans and animals that address how RSA interacts with stimulus-induced activity; we also discuss, conversely, how stimulus-induced activity can modulate RSA. Psychologically, the rest-stimulus interaction is relevant to predicting subsequent behavioral and mental states. We conclude that a better understanding of the rest-stimulus interaction is likely to be crucial to the elucidation of the brain's contribution to mental states.","Addictive drugs cause persistent restructuring of several neuronal cell types in the limbic regions of brain thought to be responsible for long-term behavioral plasticity driving addiction. Although these structural changes are well documented in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons, little is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, it remains unclear whether structural plasticity and its synaptic concomitants drive addictive behaviors or whether they reflect homeostatic compensations to the drug not related to addiction per se. Here, we discuss recent paradoxical data, which either support or oppose the hypothesis that drug-induced changes in dendritic spines drive addictive behavior. We define areas where future investigation can provide a more detailed picture of drug-induced synaptic reorganization, including ultrastructural, electrophysiological and behavioral studies.","The pathogenic mechanisms of degenerative diseases of the nervous system are not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that proteins with a role in RNA synthesis, processing, function and degradation play a role in the mechanism of degenerative disorders affecting the motor neuron. However, most of these proteins also affect cellular processes other than RNA processing. Furthermore, many of the familial diseases are inherited dominantly, suggesting a gain-of-function as their pathogenic mechanism. This newly gained function could be unrelated to their normal role in the cell. Therefore, here we review some of the recent data linking RNA metabolism and motor neuron disorders, but also critically assess their relevance for our understanding of the mechanism of neurodegeneration.","A persistent mystery about the ataxias has been why mutations in genes--many of which are expressed widely in the brain--primarily cause ataxia, and not, for example, epilepsy or dementia. Why should a polyglutamine stretch in the TATA-binding protein (that is important in all cells) particularly disrupt cerebellar coordination? We propose that advances in the genetics of cerebellar ataxias suggest a rational hypothesis for how so many different genes lead to predominantly cerebellar defects. We argue that the unifying feature of many genes involved in cerebellar ataxias is their impact on the signaling protein ITPR1 (inositiol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1), that underlies coincidence detection in Purkinje cells and could play an important role in cerebellar coordination.","The activation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent gene expression seems a crucial step in the molecular cascade that mediates the formation of long-lasting memories. This view is based both on correlative evidence and on functional assays that demonstrate, through loss- and gain-of-function experiments, the impact of CREB manipulation on memory performance. Mechanistically, CREB's role in memory is thought to be a consequence of its participation in long-term forms of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies demonstrate that CREB, in addition to synaptic plasticity, also modulates the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. This discovery reveals new intriguing connections between intrinsic and synaptic plasticity and is likely to have a significant impact on our understanding of the role of CREB in memory formation.","Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are the first identified auxiliary subunits for a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel. Although initial studies found that stargazin, the prototypical TARP, principally chaperones AMPA receptors, subsequent research demonstrated that it also regulates AMPA receptor kinetics and synaptic waveforms. Recent studies have identified a diverse collection of TARP isoforms--types Ia, Ib II--that distinctly regulate AMPA receptor trafficking, gating and neuropharmacology. These TARP isoforms are heterogeneously expressed in specific neuronal populations and can differentially sculpt synaptic transmission and plasticity. Whole-genome analyses also link multiple TARP loci to childhood epilepsy, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. TARPs emerge as vital components of excitatory synapses that participate both in signal transduction and in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Episodic and spatial memories each involve the encoding of complex associations in hippocampal neuronal circuits. Such memory traces could be stabilised from short- to long-term forms by consolidation processes involving the 'reactivation' of the original network firing patterns during sleep and rest. Waking experience can be replayed in many different brain areas, but an important role for the hippocampus lies in the organisation of the 'reactivation' process. Emerging evidence suggests that sharp wave/ripple (SWR) events in the hippocampus could coordinate the reactivation of memory traces and direct their reinstatement in cortical circuits. Although the mechanisms remain uncertain, there is a growing consensus that such SWR-directed reactivation of brain-wide memory traces could underlie memory consolidation.","mRNA localization and regulated translation provide a means of spatially restricting gene expression within each of the thousands of subcellular compartments made by a neuron, thereby vastly increasing the computational capacity of the brain. Recent studies reveal that local translation is regulated by stimuli that trigger neurite outgrowth and/or collapse, axon guidance, synapse formation, pruning, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and injury-induced axonal regeneration. Impairments in the local regulation of translation result in aberrant signaling, physiology and morphology of neurons, and are linked to neurological disorders. This review highlights current advances in understanding how mRNA translation is repressed during transport and how local translation is activated by stimuli. We address the function of local translation in the context of fragile X mental retardation.","The interplay of transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers, including histone modifications, DNA methylation and microRNAs during development is essential for the acquisition of specific cell fates. Here, we review the epigenetic ""programming"" of stem cells into oligodendrocytes, by analyzing three sequential stages of lineage progression. The first transition from pluripotent stem cells to neural precursors is characterized by repression of pluripotency genes and restriction of the lineage potential to the neural fate. The second transition from multipotential precursors to oligodendrocyte progenitors is associated with the progressive loss of plasticity and the repression of neuronal and astrocytic genes. The last step of differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into myelin-forming cells is defined by a model of derepression of myelin genes.","Recently it has become clear that the neuronal compartment plays a more important role than previously thought in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. Apart from demyelination, neuronal pathology is apparently largely responsible for the brain atrophy that can be observed early on and throughout the course of the disease. The loss of axons and their neurons in the course of chronic neuroinflammation is a major factor determining long-term disability in patients. The actual steps leading from immune attack against the myelin sheath to neuronal damage are not yet fully clear. Here we review key findings about direct axonal damage processes, demyelination-related neuronal pathology and cell-body pathology, the major pathologic correlates that underlie brain atrophy in MS.","To successfully interact with their environments, developing organisms need to correctly process sensory information and generate motor outputs appropriate to their size and structure. Patterned sensory experience has long been known to induce various forms of developmental plasticity that ultimately shape mature neural circuits. These same types of plasticity also allow developing organisms to respond appropriately to the external world by dynamically adapting neural circuit function to ongoing changes in brain circuitry and sensory input. Recent work on the visual systems of frogs and fish has provided an unprecedented view into how visual experience dynamically affects circuit function at many levels, ranging from gene expression to network function, ultimately leading to system-wide functional adaptations.","Cerebellar granule cells undergo profound and rapid morphological modifications during development while they migrate from their birthplace at the surface of the cerebellar cortex to its deepest layer. Post-mitotic granule cells extend bipolar axons and sequentially use the two main modes of migration, tangential and radial, to reach their final destinations. Recent studies show that protein degradation involving key cell-cycle regulators controls granule cell axon extension. The use of knockout mice deficient in different axon-guidance molecules combined with cutting-edge imaging methods has started to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that trigger granule cell migration. These studies suggest that a major reorganization of the cytoskeleton occurs as granule cells switch from tangential to radial migration.","Recent studies show that dendritic spines are dynamic structures. Their rapid creation, destruction and shape-changing are essential for short- and long-term plasticity at excitatory synapses on pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. The onset of long-term potentiation, spine-volume growth and an increase in receptor trafficking are coincident, enabling a 'functional readout' of spine structure that links the age, size, strength and lifetime of a synapse. Spine dynamics are also implicated in long-term memory and cognition: intrinsic fluctuations in volume can explain synapse maintenance over long periods, and rapid, activity-triggered plasticity can relate directly to cognitive processes. Thus, spine dynamics are cellular phenomena with important implications for cognition and memory. Furthermore, impaired spine dynamics can cause psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.","Excitatory synaptic transmission is altered during aging in hippocampal granule cells, and in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. These functional changes contribute to age-associated impairments in experimentally-induced plasticity in each of these primary hippocampal subregions. In CA1, plasticity evoked by stimulation shares common mechanisms with the synaptic modification observed following natural behavior. Aging results in deficits in both artificially- and behaviorally-induced plasticity, and this could in part reflect age-related changes in Ca2+ homeostasis. Other observations, however, suggest that increased intracellular Ca2+ levels are beneficial under some circumstances. This review focuses on age-associated changes in synaptic function, how these alterations might contribute to cognitive decline, and the extent to which altered hippocampal circuit properties are detrimental or reflect compensatory processes.","Sensory representations are repeatedly transformed by neural computations that determine which of their attributes can be effectively processed at each stage. Whereas some early computations are common across multiple sensory systems, they can utilize dissimilar underlying mechanisms depending on the properties of each modality. Recent work in the olfactory bulb has substantially clarified the neural algorithms underlying early odor processing. The high-dimensionality of odor space strictly limits the utility of topographical representations, forcing similarity-dependent computations such as decorrelation to employ unusual neural algorithms. The distinct architectures and properties of the two prominent computational layers in the olfactory bulb suggest that the bulb is directly comparable not only to the retina but also to primary visual cortex.","Determining how neuronal activity represents sensory information is central for understanding perception. Recent work shows that neural responses at different timescales can encode different stimulus attributes, resulting in a temporal multiplexing of sensory information. Multiplexing increases the encoding capacity of neural responses, enables disambiguation of stimuli that cannot be discriminated at a single response timescale, and makes sensory representations stable to the presence of variability in the sensory world. Thus, as we discuss here, temporal multiplexing could be a key strategy used by the brain to form an information-rich and stable representation of the environment.","Multiple sclerosis (MS), an incurable but manageable disorder, is characterized by chronic inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Although the primary cause of this often devastating disease remains elusive, major therapeutic advances have occurred during the past two decades. Here, we present a review of current immunomodulatory treatments and outline upcoming therapy approaches, including biologics and oral alternatives that might have equivalent or superior efficacy and/or enhanced tolerability compared with available treatments, and discuss the scientific rationale and expected benefits and risks for these compounds. We also speculate about alternatives beyond immune-directed approaches, review novel insights into the neurobiological consequences of sustained brain inflammation and evaluate future perspectives for neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment strategies for MS.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D, a hereditary axonal neuropathy, is caused by mutations in glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS). The mutations are distributed throughout the protein in multiple functional domains. In biochemical and cell culture experiments, some mutant forms of GARS have been indistinguishable from wild-type protein, suggesting that these in vitro tests might not adequately assess the aberrant activity responsible for axonal degeneration. Recently, mouse and fly models have offered new insights into the disease mechanism. There are still gaps in our understanding of how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed component of the translation machinery result in axonal neuropathy. Here, we review recent reports, weigh the evidence for and against possible mechanisms and suggest areas of focus for future work.","Pannexins are large-pore ion channels with broad expression in the central nervous system (CNS). The channels function by releasing large signaling molecules, such ATP and arachidonic acid derivatives, from neurons and possibly astrocytes. They might also contribute to novel forms of non-synaptic communication in the CNS, thereby affecting synaptic function, astrocytic Ca(2+) wave propagation and possibly regulation of vascular tone in the brain. Panx1 activation in various in vitro pathological conditions implicates these channels in ischemic, excitotoxic and ATP-dependent cell death, whereas Panx coupling with purinergic receptors triggers the inflammasome. Novel functions for the pannexin channels are likely to be discovered as current understanding of how they are regulated in physiological and pathological situations improves.","Unlike most mammalian species, the prairie vole is highly affiliative, forms enduring social bonds between mates and displays biparental behavior. Over two decades of research on this species has enhanced our understanding of the neurobiological basis not only of monogamy, social attachment and nurturing behaviors but also other aspects of social cognition. Because social cognitive deficits are hallmarks of many psychiatric disorders, discoveries made in prairie voles can direct novel treatment strategies for disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. With the ongoing development of molecular, genetic and genomic tools for this species, prairie voles will likely maintain their current trajectory becoming an unprecedented model organism for basic and translational research focusing on the biology of the social brain.","Conserved Ryk transmembrane proteins, tyrosine kinase-related Wnt receptors, are important during neurogenesis, axon guidance and synaptogenesis. Here, we review the increasingly complex biology of the Wnt/Ryk pathway, emphasizing the mechanisms by which Ryks transduce or sometimes block the Wnt signal. Recent studies reveal that Wnts signal through Ryk via multiple mechanisms, including nuclear translocation of their intracellular domains and pathways employing Src Family Kinases and members of the canonical Wnt pathway. We also discuss reports indicating that Wnt/Ryk axon guidance roles are evolutionarily conserved and Wnt/Ryk interactions are required for motoneuron target selection and synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction. Recent findings that injury-induced Wnt/Ryk pathway activation inhibits axon regeneration underscore the importance of further understanding this novel pathway.","The proportional relation between circulating vasopressin concentration and plasma osmolality is fundamental for body fluid homeostasis. Although changes in the sensitivity of this relation are associated with pathophysiological conditions, central mechanisms modulating osmoregulatory gain are unknown. Here, we review recent data that sheds important light on this process. The cell autonomous osmosensitivity of vasopressin neurons depends on cation channels comprising a variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Hyperosmotic activation is mediated by a mechanical process where sensitivity increases in proportion with actin filament density. Moreover, angiotensin II amplifies osmotic activation by a rapid stimulation of actin polymerization, suggesting that neurotransmitter-induced changes in cytoskeletal organization in osmosensory neurons can mediate central changes in osmoregulatory gain.","Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase involved in translation control and long-lasting synaptic plasticity. mTOR functions as the central component of two multi-protein signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which can be distinguished from each other based on their unique compositions and substrates. Although the majority of evidence linking mTOR function to synaptic plasticity comes from studies utilizing rapamycin, studies in genetically modified mice also suggest that mTOR couples receptors to the translation machinery for establishing long-lasting synaptic changes that are the basis for higher order brain function, including long-term memory. Finally, perturbation of the mTOR signaling cascade appears to be a common pathophysiological feature of human neurological disorders, including mental retardation syndromes and autism spectrum disorders.","Recovery of consciousness following severe brain injuries can occur over long time intervals. Importantly, evolving cognitive recovery can be strongly dissociated from motor recovery in some individuals, resulting in underestimation of cognitive capacities. Common mechanisms of cerebral dysfunction that arise at the neuronal population level may explain slow functional recoveries from severe brain injuries. This review proposes a ""mesocircuit"" model that predicts specific roles for different structural and dynamic changes that may occur gradually during recovery. Recent functional neuroimaging studies that operationally identify varying levels of awareness, memory and other higher brain functions in patients with no behavioral evidence of these cognitive capacities are discussed. Measuring evolving changes in underlying brain function and dynamics post-injury and post-treatment frames future investigative work.","Chronic pain is characterized by enhanced sensory neurotransmission that underlies increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli and the perception of non-noxious stimuli as painful. Evidence from neurophysiological and pharmacological studies demonstrates that ATP produces pain by directly enhancing neuronal excitability via the activation of specific ligand-gated ion channels, the P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors. In addition, ATP activates CNS glial cells (e.g. microglia) in response to persistent nociceptive stimulation. This latter effect involves several distinct receptor-mediated signaling pathways linked to the P2X4, P2X7 and P2Y(12) receptors. This review summarizes new data that places these purinergic signaling events in a mechanistic context that illustrates the ability of ATP to initiate and maintain states of heightened sensory neuron excitability associated with persistent pain.","Neurofilament (NF) protein expression is coupled to axon development and the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis. Here, we present evidence that this tight regulation depends critically on post-transcriptionally regulated changes in NF mRNA transport, translation and stability. Recent studies have shown that post-transcriptional mechanisms modulate increases in NF gene transcription during axon regeneration to yield the final pattern of NF protein expression. Other recent work has found that post-transcriptional control of NFs shares elements with that of other axonal proteins and that its dysregulation contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such studies herald a novel approach to understanding how neurons coordinate the expressions of functionally related proteins and provide new insights into how the dysregulation of this control can lead to disease.","Decades of research on the cellular mechanisms of memory have led to the widely held view that memories are stored as modifications of synaptic strength. These changes involve presynaptic processes, such as direct modulation of the release machinery, or postsynaptic processes, such as modulation of receptor properties. Parallel studies have revealed that memories might also be stored by nonsynaptic processes, such as modulation of voltage-dependent membrane conductances, which are expressed as changes in neuronal excitability. Although in some cases nonsynaptic changes can function as part of the engram itself, they might also serve as mechanisms through which a neural circuit is set to a permissive state to facilitate synaptic modifications that are necessary for memory storage.","During neural development, the cytoskeleton of newborn neurons undergoes extensive and dynamic remodelling to facilitate the sequential steps of neurogenesis, cell migration and terminal differentiation. It is clear from studying the mechanisms that precipitate these functions that different configurations of the cytoskeleton prefigure the correct execution of each step and define cohorts of proteins the functions of which are indispensable for the control of neuronal migration but not terminal differentiation. These combinatorial protein functions are also predetermined by regulated gene expression and the precise subcellular localisation of their protein products. Here, we expand on this view in the context of recent data on how the cytoskeleton is regulated during the maturation of cortical neurons within the developing brain.","In many situations, decision makers need to negotiate between the competing demands of response speed and response accuracy, a dilemma generally known as the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). Despite the ubiquity of SAT, the question of how neural decision circuits implement SAT has received little attention up until a year ago. We review recent studies that show SAT is modulated in association and pre-motor areas rather than in sensory or primary motor areas. Furthermore, the studies suggest that emphasis on response speed increases the baseline firing rate of cortical integrator neurons. We also review current theories on how and where in the brain the SAT is controlled, and we end by proposing research directions that could distinguish between these theories.","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important regulator of blood pressure. Observational and experimental studies suggest that alterations in blood pressure and components of the brain RAS contribute to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in changes that can lead or contribute to cognitive decline. The complexity of the RAS and diversity of its interactions with neurological processes have recently become apparent but large gaps in our understanding still remain. Modulation of activity of components of the brain RAS offers substantial opportunities for the treatment and prevention of dementia, including AD. This paper reviews molecular, genetic, experimental and clinical data as well as the therapeutic opportunities that relate to the involvement of the RAS in AD.","Reactive astrogliosis, whereby astrocytes undergo varying molecular and morphological changes, is a ubiquitous but poorly understood hallmark of all central nervous system pathologies. Genetic tools are now enabling the molecular dissection of the functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that reactive astrogliosis can exert both beneficial and detrimental effects in a context-dependent manner determined by specific molecular signaling cascades. Reactive astrocytes can have both loss of normal functions and gain of abnormal effects that could feature prominently in a variety of disease processes. This article reviews developments in the signaling mechanisms that regulate specific aspects of reactive astrogliosis and highlights the potential to identify novel therapeutic molecular targets for diverse neurological disorders.","Recent progress in cognitive neuroscience highlights the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in social cognition. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that representations within the lateral PFC enable people to coordinate their thoughts and actions with their intentions to support goal-directed social behavior. Despite the importance of this region in guiding social interactions, remarkably little is known about the functional organization and forms of social inference processed by the lateral PFC. Here, we introduce a cognitive neuroscience framework for understanding the inferential architecture of the lateral PFC, drawing upon recent theoretical developments in evolutionary psychology and emerging neuroscience evidence about how this region can orchestrate behavior on the basis of evolutionarily adaptive social norms for obligatory, prohibited and permissible courses of action.","The transition from acute to chronic pain states might be the most important challenge in research to improve clinical treatment of debilitating pain. We describe a recently identified mechanism of neuronal plasticity in primary afferent nociceptive nerve fibers (nociceptors) by which an acute inflammatory insult or environmental stressor can trigger long-lasting hypersensitivity of nociceptors to inflammatory cytokines. This phenomenon, ""hyperalgesic priming,"" depends on the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon) and a switch in intracellular signaling pathways that mediate cytokine-induced nociceptor hyperexcitability. We discuss the impact of this discovery on our understanding of, and ultimately our ability to treat, a variety of enigmatic and debilitating pain conditions, including those associated with repetitive injury, and generalized pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia.","Enhanced acute tolerance predicts alcohol abuse. We describe work on the role of the calcium- and voltage-gated BK channel in alcohol tolerance, highlighting the lipid environment, BK protein isoform selection and auxiliary BK channel proteins. We show how ethanol, which had the reputation of a nonspecific membrane perturbant, is now being examined at realistic concentrations with cutting-edge techniques, providing novel molecular targets for therapeutic approaches to alcoholism. Addictive disorders impact our emotional, physical and financial status, and burden our healthcare system. Although alcohol is the focus of this review, it is highly probable, given the common neural and biochemical pathways used by drugs of abuse, that the findings described here will also apply to other drugs.","Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been implicated in the migration, maturation and survival of neurons born during embryonic development. New evidence suggests that Cdk5 has comparable but also distinct functions in adult neurogenesis. Here we summarize accumulating evidence on the role of Cdk5 in regulation of the cell cycle, migration, survival, maturation and neuronal integration. We specifically highlight the many similarities and few tantalizing differences in the roles of Cdk5 in the embryonic and adult brain. We discuss the signaling pathways that might contribute to Cdk5 action in regulating embryonic and adult neurogenesis, highlighting future research directions that will help to clarify the mechanisms underlying lifelong neurogenesis in the mammalian brain.","Cognitive neuroscience research relies, in part, on homologies between the brains of human and non-human primates. A quandary therefore arises when presumed anatomical homologues exhibit different functional properties. Such a situation has recently arisen in the case of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In humans, numerous studies suggest a role for ACC in detecting conflicts in information processing. Studies of macaque monkey ACC, in contrast, have failed to find conflict-related responses. We consider several interpretations of this discrepancy, including differences in research methodology and cross-species differences in functional neuroanatomy. New directions for future research are outlined, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing illusory cross-species differences from the true evolutionary differences that make our species unique.","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in homeostasis of protein acetylation in histones and other proteins and in regulating fundamental cellular activities such as transcription. A wide range of brain disorders are associated with imbalances in protein acetylation levels and transcriptional dysfunctions. Treatment with various HDAC inhibitors can correct these deficiencies and has emerged as a promising new strategy for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we review and discuss intriguing recent developments in the use of HDAC inhibitors to combat neurodegenerative conditions in cellular and disease models. HDAC inhibitors have neuroprotective, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory properties; improvements in neurological performance, learning/memory and other disease phenotypes are frequently seen in these models. We discuss the targets and mechanisms underlying these effects of HDAC inhibition and comment on the potential for some HDAC inhibitors to prove clinically effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.","Glioblastoma brain tumors harbor a small population of cancer stem cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, and are believed responsible for tumor recurrence and mortality. The identification of the epigenetic molecular mechanisms that control self-renewal of glioblastoma stem cells will foster development of targeted therapeutic approaches. The transcriptional repressor REST, best known for its role in controlling cell fate decisions in neural progenitor cells, may also be crucial for cancer stem cell self-renewal. Two novel mechanisms for regulating the stability of REST have recently been revealed: these involve the telomere-binding protein TRF2 and the ubiquitin E3 ligase SCFbeta-TrCP. Reduced TRF2 binding to REST, and increased SCFbeta-TrCP activity, target REST for proteasomal degradation and thereby inhibit cancer stem cell proliferation. Neurological side effects of treatments that target REST and TRF2 may be less severe than conventional brain tumor treatments because postmitotic neurons do not express REST and have relatively stable telomeres.","We present an overview of recent paradigms used for studying visual information and reward processing in the human and monkey oculomotor pathways. Current evidence indicates that eye movements made during visual search tasks rely on neural computations similar to those employed when eye movements are planned and executed to obtain explicit rewards. These data suggest that human eye movements originate from the processing of (predominantly visual) sensory information, feedback about previous errors, and expectations about factors, such as reward. We conclude that these properties make the saccadic system an ideal model for studying both the behavioral and neural mechanisms for human voluntary and involuntary choice behavior.","Network analysis of functional brain imaging data is an innovative approach to study circuit abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, spatial covariance analysis of resting-state metabolic images has identified specific regional patterns associated with motor and cognitive symptoms. With functional imaging, these metabolic networks have recently been used to measure system-related progression and to evaluate novel treatment strategies. Network analysis is also being used to characterize specific functional biomarkers for Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These networks have been particularly helpful in uncovering compensatory mechanisms in genetically at-risk individuals. Ongoing developments in network applications are likely to enhance the role of functional imaging in the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders.","Understanding how molecular signaling pathways participate in behavioral responses requires determining precisely in which neuronal populations they are activated. The recent development of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing a variety of reporters, epitope tagged-proteins or Cre recombinase driven by specific promoters, is a significant step forward in this direction. These mice help overcome the limitations of traditional approaches that examine an average of signaling events occurring in mixed populations of cells. Here, we review how recent studies using such tools have revisited the regulation of striatal signaling pathways, demonstrating the striking segregation between neurons expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and significantly extending our overall knowledge of striatal neurons. Thus, BAC transgenic mice are changing the way to conceive experiments and provide an opportunity to fill the gaps between molecular and systems neurosciences.","Forebrain dopamine circuitry has traditionally been studied by two largely independent specialist groups: students of Parkinson's disease who study the nigrostriatal dopamine system that originates in the substantia nigra (SN), and students of motivation and addiction who study the role of the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems that originate in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The anatomical evidence for independent nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems has, however, long been obsolete. There is now compelling evidence that both nominal ""systems"" participate in reward function and addiction. Electrical stimulation of both SN and VTA is rewarding, blockade of glutamatergic or cholinergic input to either SN or VTA attenuates the habit-forming effects of intravenous cocaine, and dopamine in both nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic terminal fields participates in the defining property of rewarding events: the reinforcement of memory consolidation. Thus, the similarities between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems can be as important as their differences.","Animals that depend on smell for communication and survival extract multiple pieces of information from a single complex odor. Mice can collect information on sex, genotype, health and dietary status from urine scent marks, a stimulus made up of hundreds of molecules. This ability is all the more remarkable considering that natural odors are encountered against varying olfactory backgrounds; the olfactory system must therefore provide some mechanism for extracting the most relevant information. Here we discuss recent data indicating that the readout of olfactory input by mitral cells in the olfactory bulb can be modified by behavioral context. We speculate that the olfactory cortex plays a key role in tuning the readout of olfactory information from the olfactory bulb.","Cellular events underlying the establishment of glutamate transmission have been the focus of attention because appropriate wiring of developing neuronal networks is essential for adult brain functions. Although establishment of a synapse is a dynamic process requiring axonal and dendritic refinements, the functional interplay between pre- and postsynaptic signaling is often ignored. Here, we discuss recent data on pre- and postsynaptic plasticity of the glutamate synapse in the developing brain. The key aspect of the proposed model is that developing synapses are functionally labile in response to activity and this lability is counteracted by Hebbian activity. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic (loss of AMPA receptor signaling) mechanisms contribute to lability. Therefore, synapses in the developing brain maintain their capacity for functional AMPA signaling either by being presynaptically silent or by having participated in Hebbian activity; any synaptic activity outside this context leads instead to AMPA silencing and possible synaptic elimination.","Air pollution has been implicated as a chronic source of neuroinflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that produce neuropathology and central nervous system (CNS) disease. Stroke incidence and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease pathology are linked to air pollution. Recent reports reveal that air pollution components reach the brain; systemic effects that impact lung and cardiovascular disease also impinge upon CNS health. While mechanisms driving air pollution-induced CNS pathology are poorly understood, new evidence suggests that microglial activation and changes in the blood-brain barrier are key components. Here we summarize recent findings detailing the mechanisms through which air pollution reaches the brain and activates the resident innate immune response to become a chronic source of pro-inflammatory factors and ROS, culminating in CNS disease.","Microsaccades are the largest and fastest of the fixational eye movements, which are involuntary eye movements produced during attempted visual fixation. In recent years, the interaction between microsaccades, perception and cognition has become one of the most rapidly growing areas of study in visual neuroscience. The neurophysiological consequences of microsaccades have been the focus of less attention, however, as have the oculomotor mechanisms that generate and control microsaccades. Here we review the latest neurophysiological findings concerning microsaccades and discuss their relationships to perception and cognition. We also point out the current gaps in our understanding of the neurobiology of microsaccades and identify the most promising lines of enquiry.","Despite anecdotal evidence suggesting conscious states in a variety of non-human animals, no systematic neuroscientific investigation of animal consciousness has yet been undertaken. We set forth a framework for such an investigation that incorporates integration of data from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and behavioral studies, uses evidence from humans as a benchmark, and recognizes the critical role of explicit verbal report of conscious experiences in human studies. We illustrate our framework with reference to two subphyla: one relatively near to mammals - birds - and one quite far -cephalopod molluscs. Consistent with the possibility of conscious states, both subphyla exhibit complex behavior and possess sophisticated nervous systems. Their further investigation may reveal common phyletic conditions and neural substrates underlying the emergence of animal consciousness.","The ability to image the newborn brain during development has provided new information regarding the effects of injury on brain development at different vulnerable time periods. Studies in animal models of brain injury correlate beautifully with what is now observed in the human newborn. We now know that injury at term primarily results in grey matter injury while injury in the premature brain predominantly results in a pattern of white matter injury, though recent evidence suggests a blurring of this distinction . These injuries affect how the brain matures subsequently and again, imaging has led to new insights that allow us to match function and structure. This review will focus on these patterns of injury that are so crucially determined by age at insult. In addition, this review will highlight how the brain responds to these insults with changes in connectivity that have profound functional consequences.","Schizophrenia (SZ) is primarily an adult psychiatric disorder in which disturbances caused by susceptibility genes and environmental insults during early neurodevelopment initiate neurophysiological changes over a long time course, culminating in the onset of full-blown disease nearly two decades later. Aberrant postnatal brain maturation is an essential mechanism underlying the disease. Currently, symptoms of SZ are treated with anti-psychotic medications that have variable efficacy and severe side effects. There has been much interest in the prodromal phase and the possibility of preventing SZ by interfering with the aberrant postnatal brain maturation associated with this disorder. Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that underlie the long-term progression to full disease manifestation to identify the best targets and approaches towards this goal. We believe that studies of certain SZ genetic susceptibility factors with neurodevelopmental implications will be key tools in this task. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) are probably functionally convergent and play key roles in brain development. We provide an update on the role of these emerging concepts in understanding the complex time course of SZ from early neurodevelopmental disturbances to later onset and suggest ways of testing these in the future.","Individual transcription factors in the brain frequently display broad functional versatility, thereby controlling multiple cellular outputs. In accordance, neuron-restricted mutagenesis of the murine Srf gene, encoding the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF), revealed numerous SRF functions in the nervous system. First, SRF controls immediate early gene (IEG) activation associated with perception of synaptic activity, learning and memory. Second, processes linked to actin cytoskeletal dynamics are mediated by SRF, such as developmental neuronal migration, outgrowth and pathfinding of neurites, as well as synaptic targeting. Therefore, SRF seems to be instrumental in converting synaptic activity into plasticity-associated structural changes in neuronal connectivities. This highlights the decisive role of SRF in integrating cytoskeletal actin dynamics and nuclear gene expression. Finally, we relate SRF to the multi-functional transcription factor CREB and point out overlapping, distinct and concerted functions of these two transcriptional regulators in the brain.","The retrieval of a memory places it into a plastic state, the result of which is that the memory can be disrupted or even enhanced by experimental treatment. This phenomenon has been conceptualised within a framework of memories being reactivated and then reconsolidated in repeated rounds of cellular processing. The reconsolidation phase has been seized upon as crucial for the understanding of memory stability and, more recently, as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of disorders such as post-traumatic stress and drug addiction. However, little is known about the reactivation process, or what might be the adaptive function of retrieval-induced plasticity. Reconsolidation has long been proposed to mediate memory updating, but only recently has this hypothesis been supported experimentally. Here, the adaptive function of memory reconsolidation is explored in more detail, with a strong emphasis on its role in updating memories to maintain their relevance.","Our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of two common neurodegenerative dementias, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), has greatly advanced in recent years. Progranulin mutations were identified as a major cause of FTLD and a potential susceptibility factor for other forms of dementia. In addition, through copy-number analyses of previously identified disease genes and the study of microRNA regulation in dementia, new evidence emerged to support the view that subtle variability in the expression of known disease proteins could increase the risk for sporadic forms of dementia. Finally, in late-onset AD populations, the first genome-wide association studies were performed and novel potential AD susceptibility genes reported. These exciting findings provide novel insights into the disease mechanisms underlying dementia and hold promise for the development of potential treatments.","Each of the five cellular layers of the cerebral neocortex is composed of a specific number of a single predominant 'class' of projection neuron. The projection neuron class is defined by its unique morphology and axonal projections to other areas of the brain. Precursor cell populations lining the embryonic lateral ventricles produce the projection neurons. The mechanisms regulating precursor cell proliferation also regulate total numbers of neurons produced at specific developmental periods and destined to a specific neocortical layer. Because the newborn neurons migrate relatively long distances to reach their final layer destinations, it is often assumed that the mechanisms governing acquisition of neuronal-class-specific characteristics, many of which become evident after neuron production, are independent of the mechanisms governing neuron production. We review evidence that suggests that the two mechanisms might be linked via operations of Notch1 and p27(Kip1), molecules known to regulate precursor cell proliferation and neuron production.","The term 'tripartite synapse' refers to a concept in synaptic physiology based on the demonstration of the existence of bidirectional communication between astrocytes and neurons. Consistent with this concept, in addition to the classic 'bipartite' information flow between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, astrocytes exchange information with the synaptic neuronal elements, responding to synaptic activity and, in turn, regulating synaptic transmission. Because recent evidence has demonstrated that astrocytes integrate and process synaptic information and control synaptic transmission and plasticity, astrocytes, being active partners in synaptic function, are cellular elements involved in the processing, transfer and storage of information by the nervous system. Consequently, in contrast to the classically accepted paradigm that brain function results exclusively from neuronal activity, there is an emerging view, which we review herein, in which brain function actually arises from the coordinated activity of a network comprising both neurons and glia.","Recent advances in genetics and genomics have unveiled numerous cases of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) associated with rare, causal genetic variations. These findings support a novel view of ASDs in which many independent, individually rare genetic variants, each associated with a very high relative risk, together explain a large proportion of ASDs. Although these rare variants impact diverse pathways, there is accumulating evidence that synaptic pathways, including those involving synaptic cell adhesion, are disrupted in some subjects with ASD. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of ASDs and enable the development of model systems with construct validity for specific causes of ASDs. In several neurodevelopmental disorders frequently associated with ASD, including fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, animal models have led to the development of new therapeutic approaches, giving rise to optimism with other causes of ASDs.","Discerning a target amongst visual 'clutter' is a complicated task that has been elegantly solved by flying insects, as evidenced by their mid-air interactions with conspecifics and prey. The neurophysiology of small-target motion detectors (STMDs) underlying these complex behaviors has recently been described and suggests that insects use mechanisms similar to those of hypercomplex cells of the mammalian visual cortex to achieve target-specific tuning. Cortical hypercomplex cells are end-stopped, which means that they respond optimally to small moving targets, with responses to extended bars attenuated. We review not only the underlying mechanisms involved in this tuning but also how recently proposed models provide a possible explanation for another remarkable property of these neurons - their ability to respond robustly to the motion of targets even against moving backgrounds.","In neurons multiple signaling pathways converge in the nucleus to regulate the expression of genes associated with long-term structural changes of synapto-dendritic input. Of pivotal importance for this type of transcriptional regulation is synapse-to-nucleus communication. Several studies suggest that the nuclear transport of proteins from synapses is involved in this signaling process, including evidence that synapses contain proteins with nuclear localization sequences and components of the nuclear import machinery. Here, we review the evidence for synapse-to-nucleus signaling by means of retrograde transport of proteins from distal processes. We discuss the mechanisms involved in their translocation and their role in the control of nuclear gene expression. Finally, we summarize the current thinking regarding the functional implications of nuclear signaling and address open questions in this evolving area of neuroscience.","How does the brain represent external reality so that it can be perceived in the form of mental images? How are the representations stored in memory so that an approximation of their original content can be re-experienced during recall? A framework introduced in the late 1980s proposed that mental images arise from neural activity in early sensory cortices both during perception and recall. Neurons in the association cortices, by contrast, would not code explicit mental content; rather, they would hold the records needed to reconstruct an approximation of the original perceptual maps in early cortices. Several neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies now lend growing support to this proposal.","The factors that determine brain aging remain a mystery. Do brain aging and memory loss reflect processes occurring only within the brain? Here, we present a novel view, linking aging of adaptive immunity to brain senescence and specifically to spatial memory deterioration. Inborn immune deficiency, in addition to sudden imposition of immune malfunction in young animals, results in cognitive impairment. As a corollary, immune restoration at adulthood or in the elderly results in a reversal of memory loss. These results, together with the known deterioration of adaptive immunity in the elderly, suggest that memory loss does not solely reflect chronological age; rather, it is an outcome of the gap between an increasing demand for maintenance (age-related risk-factor accumulation) and the reduced ability of the immune system to meet these needs.","Invasive recording of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) of behaving animals suggests a role for these neurons in reward learning and novelty processing. In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently the only non-invasive event-related method to measure SN/VTA activity, but it is debated to what extent fMRI enables inference about dopaminergic responses within the SN/VTA. We consider the anatomical and functional parcellation of the primate SN/VTA and find that its homogeneity suggests little variation in the regional specificity of fMRI signals for reward-related dopaminergic responses. Hence, these responses seem to be well captured by the compound fMRI signal from the SN/VTA, which seems quantitatively related to dopamine release in positron emission tomography (PET). We outline how systematic investigation of the functional parcellation of the SN/VTA in animals, new developments in fMRI analysis and combined PET-fMRI studies can narrow the gap between fMRI and dopaminergic neurotransmission.",Several well-validated susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have now been identified. We suggest that these genes can be divided into two broad classes. Those in the first class have direct effects on synaptic plasticity mediated through actions at glutamatergic synapses; those in the second class impact on meso-limbic dopamine signalling. We argue that these genes have an interactive effect on risk for psychosis and that this interaction can be understood in the context of associative learning theory. We illustrate how genetic variation in genes from these classes can contribute to the development of psychosis using data from the Edinburgh High Risk Study of schizophrenia.,"A large body of evidence indicates that nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) essentially contribute to the processing of nociceptive signals in the spinal cord. Many animal studies have unanimously shown that inhibition of NO or cGMP synthesis can considerably reduce both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, experiments with NO donors and cGMP analogs also caused conflicting results because dual pronociceptive and antinociceptive effects of these molecules have been observed. Here, we summarize the most recent advances in the understanding of NO- and cGMP-dependent signaling pathways in the spinal cord and further unravel the role of NO and cGMP in pain processing.","Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that is still characterized by its symptoms rather than by biological markers because we have only a limited knowledge of its underlying molecular basis. In the past two decades, however, technical advances in genetics and brain imaging have provided new insights into the biology of the disease. Based on these advances we are now in a position to develop animal models that can be used to test specific hypotheses of the disease and explore mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we consider some of the insights that have emerged from studying in mice the relationship between defined genetic and molecular alterations and the cognitive endophenotypes of schizophrenia.","Although exposure to substantial stress has a major impact on the development of depression, there is considerable variability in the susceptibility of individuals to the adverse effects of stress. The personality trait of high anxiety has been identified as a vulnerability factor to develop depression. We propose here a new unifying model based on a series of neurocognitive mechanisms (and fed with crucial information provided by research on the fields of emotion, stress and cognition) whereby individuals presenting a high anxiety trait are particularly vulnerable to develop depression when facing stress and adversity. Our model highlights the importance of developing prevention programs addressed to restrain, in high anxious individuals, the triggering of a dysfunctional neurocognitive cascade while coping with stress.","Since the days of Cajal, the CA1 pyramidal cell has arguably received more attention than any other neuron in the mammalian brain. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells fire spikes with remarkable spatial and temporal precision, giving rise to the hippocampal rate and temporal codes. However, little is known about how different inputs interact during spatial behavior to generate such robust firing patterns. Here, we review the properties of the rodent hippocampal rate code and synthesize work from several disciplines to understand the functional anatomy and excitation-inhibition balance that can produce the rate-coded outputs of the CA1 pyramidal cell. We argue that both CA3 and entorhinal inputs are crucial for the formation of sharp, sparse CA1 place fields and that precisely timed and dominant inhibition is an equally important factor.","In addition to radial glial cells of neurohistogenesis, immature astrocytes with stem-cell-like properties cordon off emerging functional patterns in the developing brain. Astrocytes also can be stem cells during adult neurogenesis, and a proposed potency of injury-associated reactive astrocytes has recently been substantiated. Astrocytic cells might additionally be involved in cancer stem cell-associated gliomagenesis. Thus, there are distinguishing roles for stem-cell-like astrocytes during brain development, in neurogenic niches in the adult, during attempted reactive neurogenesis after brain injury or disease and during brain tumorigenesis.","In the past three decades, mounting evidence has revealed that specification of the basic cortical neuronal classes starts at the time of their final mitotic divisions in the embryonic proliferative zones. This early cell determination continues during the migration of the newborn neurons across the widening cerebral wall, and it is in the cortical plate that they attain their final positions and establish species-specific cytoarchitectonic areas. Here, the development and evolutionary expansion of the neocortex is viewed in the context of the radial unit and protomap hypotheses. A broad spectrum of findings gave insight into the pathogenesis of cortical malformations and the biological bases for the evolution of the modern human neocortex. We examine the history and evidence behind the concept of early specification of neurons and provide the latest compendium of genes and signaling molecules involved in neuronal fate determination and specification.","Intercellular purinergic signalling, which utilizes ATP as a transmitter, is fundamental for the operation of the autonomic nervous system. ATP is released together with 'classical' transmitters from sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves supplying various peripheral targets, modulates neurotransmission in autonomic ganglia, has an important role in local enteric neural control and coordination of intestinal secretion and motility, and acts as a common mediator for several distinct sensory modalities. Recently, the role of ATP-mediated signalling in the central nervous control of autonomic function has been addressed. Emerging data demonstrate that in the brain ATP is involved in the operation of several key cardiorespiratory reflexes, contributes to central processing of viscerosensory information, mediates central CO(2) chemosensory transduction and triggers adaptive changes in breathing, and modulates the activities of the brainstem vagal preganglionic, presympathetic and respiratory neural networks.","Evidence is accumulating that exercise has profound benefits for brain function. Physical activity improves learning and memory in humans and animals. Moreover, an active lifestyle might prevent or delay loss of cognitive function with aging or neurodegenerative disease. Recent research indicates that the effects of exercise on the brain can be enhanced by concurrent consumption of natural products such as omega fatty acids or plant polyphenols. The potential synergy between diet and exercise could involve common cellular pathways important for neurogenesis, cell survival, synaptic plasticity and vascular function. Optimal maintenance of brain health might depend on exercise and intake of natural products.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of which the core motor symptoms are attributable to the degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Recent work has revealed that the engagement of L-type Ca(2+) channels during autonomous pacemaking renders SNc DA neurons susceptible to mitochondrial toxins used to create animal models of PD, indicating that homeostatic Ca(2+) stress could be a determinant of their selective vulnerability. This view is buttressed by the central role of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (linchpins of current theories about the origins of PD) in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Here, we summarize this evidence and suggest the dual roles had by these organelles could compromise their function, leading to accelerated aging of SNc DA neurons, particularly in the face of genetic or environmental stress. We conclude with a discussion of potential therapeutic strategies for slowing the progression of PD.","Priming is the process by which vesicles become available for fusion at nerve terminals and is modulated by numerous proteins and second messengers. One of the prominent members of this diverse family is tomosyn. Tomosyn has been identified as a syntaxin-binding protein; it inhibits vesicle priming, but its mode of action is not fully understood. The inhibitory activity of tomosyn depends on its N-terminal WD40-repeat domain and is regulated by the binding of its SNARE motif to syntaxin. Here, we describe new physiological information on the function of tomosyn and address possible interpretations of these results in the framework of the recently described crystal structure of the yeast tomosyn homolog Sro7. We also present possible molecular scenarios for vesicle priming and the involvement of tomosyn in these processes.","Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ME-MRI), blood oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can now be applied to animal species as small as mice or songbirds. These techniques confirmed previous findings but are also beginning to reveal new phenomena that were difficult or impossible to study previously. These imaging techniques will lead to major technical and conceptual advances in systems neurosciences. We illustrate these new developments with studies of the song control and auditory systems in songbirds, a spatially organized neuronal circuitry that mediates the acquisition, production and perception of complex learned vocalizations. This neural system is an outstanding model for studying vocal learning, brain steroid hormone action, brain plasticity and lateralization of brain function.","The exact location of an ion channel on the axo-somato-dendritic surface of a nerve cell crucially affects its functional impact. Recent high-resolution immunolocalization experiments examining the distribution of GABA and glutamate receptors, voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels and hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation (HCN) channels clearly demonstrate the lack of simple rules concerning their subcellular distribution. For example, the density of HCN1 subunits in pyramidal cells increases 60-fold from soma to distal dendrites but is uniform over the somato-dendritic surface of olfactory bulb external tufted cells and is highest in the axon of cortical and cerebellar basket cells. Such findings highlight the necessity of determining the precise subcellular location and density of each ion channel in every cell type. Here, I suggest that variations in the subcellular distribution of ion channels are previously unrecognized means of increasing neuronal diversity and, thus, the computational power of the brain.","TRPV1 (transient receptor potential, vanilloid) channels belong to a family of ligand-gated ion channels gated not only by the binding of certain lipophilic molecules but also by extracellular protons and physical stimuli such as heat or osmotic pressure changes. These nonselective cation channels are permeable to Na(+) and K(+) and are also very Ca(2+) permeable; in fact, TRPV1 is as Ca(2+) permeable as the NMDA receptor channel and can, thus, act as a trigger for Ca(2+)-mediated cell signaling. Although these channels are highly expressed in primary sensory afferents, accumulating evidence indicates that TRPV family channels are also present in the brain. Here, we review evidence that TRPV channels in the central nervous system might contribute to many basic neuronal functions including resting membrane potential, neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity.","In addition to short-term effects, one of the fundamental roles of extracellular nucleotides in the central nervous system involves long-term trophic effects. Physiological outcomes include neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial proliferation, migration, growth arrest and apoptosis. Nucleotides exert these functions via P2-receptor-mediated mechanisms that can also interact with polypeptide-growth-factor-mediated or integrin-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, pathogenic roles for extracellular nucleotides in response to central nervous system injury including trauma and ischemia have been observed after the release of nucleotides by damaged and dying cells and in the development of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Here, we illuminate the contribution of extracellular nucleotides to the development, growth, cellular plasticity and death of neural cells and the mechanisms regulating these trophic effects.","Research on psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and dissociative drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP) and the symptoms, neurochemical abnormalities and treatment of schizophrenia have converged. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors, which is also the target of LSD-like drugs. Several effects of PCP-like drugs are strongly affected by both 5-HT(2A) and metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor modulation. A serotonin-glutamate receptor complex in cortical pyramidal neurons has been identified that might be the target both of psychedelics and the atypical and glutamate classes of antipsychotic drugs. Recent results on the receptor, signalling and circuit mechanisms underlying the response to psychedelic and antipsychotic drugs might lead to unification of the serotonin and glutamate neurochemical hypotheses of schizophrenia.","Environmental enrichment (EE) has long been exploited to investigate the influence of the environment on brain structure and function. Robust morphological and functional effects elicited by EE at the neuronal level have been reported to be accompanied by improvements in cognitive performance. Recently, EE has been shown to accelerate the development of the visual system and to enhance visual-cortex plasticity in adulthood. These new findings highlight the potential of EE as a promising non-invasive strategy to ameliorate deficits in the maturation of the nervous system and to promote recovery of normal sensory functions in pathological conditions affecting the adult brain.","Brain development crucially depends on the integrity of microRNA (miRNA) pathways, which function at the post-transcriptional level as a rheostat of the transcriptome and proteome of the cell. miRNAs are also involved in many other, more specific, aspects of neuronal function such as neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Complete loss of miRNA expression in the brain leads to neurodegeneration in several animal models. Evidence from patient material is emerging that miRNA dysregulation could, indeed, contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. The translation of proteins previously implicated in familial forms of disease seems to be under control of miRNAs, and changes in miRNAs might explain how these proteins become affected in sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Thus, miRNAs are moving rapidly center stage as key regulators of neuronal development and function in addition to important contributors to neurodegenerative disorder.","Olfactory system oscillations play out with beautiful temporal and behavioral regularity on the oscilloscope and seem to scream 'meaning'. Always there is the fear that, although attractive, these symbols of dynamic regularity might be just seductive epiphenomena. There are now many studies that have isolated some of the neural mechanisms involved in these oscillations, and recent work argues that they are functional and even necessary at the physiological and cognitive levels. However, much remains to be done for a full understanding of their functions.","We consider the impact of purinergic signaling on the physiology of the special senses of vision, smell, taste and hearing. Purines (particularly ATP and adenosine) act as neurotransmitters, gliotransmitters and paracrine factors in the sensory retina, nasal olfactory epithelium, taste buds and cochlea. The associated purinergic receptor signaling underpins the sensory transduction and information coding in these sense organs. The P2 and P1 receptors mediate fast transmission of sensory signals and have modulatory roles in the regulation of synaptic transmitter release, for example in the adaptation to sensory overstimulation. Purinergic signaling regulates bidirectional neuron-glia interactions and is involved in the control of blood supply, extracellular ion homeostasis and the turnover of sensory epithelia by modulating apoptosis and progenitor proliferation. Purinergic signaling is an important player in pathophysiological processes in sensory tissues, and has both detrimental (pro-apoptotic) and supportive (e.g. initiation of cytoprotective stress-signaling cascades) effects.","The second half of the past century saw the emergence of a theory of cortical associative memory function originating in Donald Hebb's hypotheses on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and cell-assembly formation and dynamics. This conceptual framework has today developed into a theory of attractor memory that brings together many experimental observations from different sources and levels of investigation into computational models displaying information-processing capabilities such as efficient associative memory and holistic perception. Here, we outline a development that might eventually lead to a neurobiologically grounded theory of cortical associative memory.","Many cerebellar neurons fire spontaneously, generating 10-100 action potentials per second even without synaptic input. This high basal activity correlates with information-coding mechanisms that differ from those of cells that are quiescent until excited synaptically. For example, in the deep cerebellar nuclei, Hebbian patterns of coincident synaptic excitation and postsynaptic firing fail to induce long-term increases in the strength of excitatory inputs. Instead, excitatory synaptic currents are potentiated by combinations of inhibition and excitation that resemble the activity of Purkinje and mossy fiber afferents that is predicted to occur during cerebellar associative learning tasks. Such results indicate that circuits with intrinsically active neurons have rules for information transfer and storage that distinguish them from other brain regions.","Neurodegenerative tauopathies are marked by their common pathologic feature of aggregates formed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which are associated with synapse and neuronal loss. Changes in tau conformation result in both loss of normal function and gain of fibrillogenicity that leads to aggregation. Here, we discuss the pathophysiology of tau and emerging evidence of how changes in this protein might ultimately lead to neuronal death. In particular, based on recent evidence, we propose that a non-apoptotic caspase-associated form of death is occurring in tauopathy.","Axon-guidance-pathway molecules are involved in connectivity and repair throughout life (beyond guiding brain wiring during fetal development). One study found that variations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in axon-guidance-pathway genes were predictive of three Parkinson's disease (PD) outcomes (susceptibility, survival free of PD and age at onset of PD) in genome-wide association (GWA) datasets. The axon-guidance-pathway genes DCC, EPHB1, NTNG1, SEMA5A and SLIT3 were represented by SNPs predicting PD outcomes. Beyond GWA analyses, we also present relevant neurobiological roles of these axon-guidance-pathway molecules and consider mechanisms by which abnormal axon-guidance-molecule signaling can cause loss of connectivity and, ultimately, PD. Novel drugs and treatments could emerge from this new understanding.","Moment-to-moment changes in local neuronal activity lead to dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2009 Mar;32(3):127.,"Chronic pain secondary to neuronal injury is actively and continuously modulated at multiple locations along the sensory neuraxis. Here, we describe how nociceptive neurons of the spinal cord and thalamus process and communicate nociceptive information in terms of precisely calibrated firing patterns. We then discuss how several cell types with immunogenic properties (e.g. blood cells and glia) cause system-wide interference in nociceptive processing through novel signaling schema, thus contributing to nociceptive network plasticity and chronic pain.","Classical biological methods involving analyses of one or several genes have been the mainstay for studying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, it has become clear that these diseases exhibit complex molecular interactions involving both host genomes and environmental determinants. Systems biology represents an integrated and deeper investigation of interacting biomolecules within cells or organisms. This approach has only recently become feasible as high-throughput technologies including cDNA microarrays, mass spectrometric analyses of proteins and lipids together with rigorous bioinformatics have evolved. Herein, we review recent developments from studies of systems biology applied to multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated dementia as three prototypic neurodegenerative disorders. Existing high-content data derived from clinically and experimentally derived neural tissues point to convergent pathways among these neurodegenerative disorders, which transcend descriptive studies to reach a more integrated understanding of disease pathogenesis and, in some instances, highlighting 'druggable' network nodes.","Inflammation is the most fundamental body reaction to noxious stimuli. No vascularized tissue, organ or apparatus is free from this response. Several mediators of inflammation, originating from outside (exogenous) or inside (endogenous) the body, are known. Among the endogenous factors, extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides are attracting interest for their ubiquity and striking ability to modulate diverse immune responses. Until recently, it was doubted that the central nervous system (CNS), reportedly an 'immunoprivileged organ', could be the site of immune reactions. Nowadays, it is acknowledged that inflammation and immunity have a key role in a vast range of CNS diseases. Likewise, it is clear that purinergic signalling profoundly affects neuroinflammation. Here, we provide a brief update of the state of the art in this expanding field.","Although autism and schizophrenia are considered to be distinct neuropsychiatric developmental disorders, recent studies indicate that they share genetic factors. The same chromosomal rearrangements and several single genes have emerged as genetic risks in both disorders. One such gene is contactin-associated protein-2 (CNTNAP2). These findings raise the possibility that these neuropsychiatric disorders share pathogenic mechanisms and that similar defects in biological pathways of brain development might underlie the phenotypic spectrum of these disorders.","Human functional brain mapping as we presently know it began when the experimental strategies of cognitive psychology were combined with modern brain-imaging techniques (first positron emission tomography and then functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine how brain function supports mental activities. This marriage of disciplines and techniques galvanized the field of cognitive neuroscience, which has rapidly expanded to include a broad range of the social sciences in addition to basic scientists interested in the neurophysiology, cell biology and genetics of the imaging signals. Although much of this work has transpired over the past couple of decades, its roots can be traced back more than a century.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2009 Apr;32(4):187-8.,"Neuroelectric oscillations reflect rhythmic shifting of neuronal ensembles between high and low excitability states. In natural settings, important stimuli often occur in rhythmic streams, and when oscillations entrain to an input rhythm their high excitability phases coincide with events in the stream, effectively amplifying neuronal input responses. When operating in a 'rhythmic mode', attention can use these differential excitability states as a mechanism of selection by simply enforcing oscillatory entrainment to a task-relevant input stream. When there is no low-frequency rhythm that oscillations can entrain to, attention operates in a 'continuous mode', characterized by extended increase in gamma synchrony. We review the evidence for early sensory selection by oscillatory phase-amplitude modulations, its mechanisms and its perceptual and behavioral consequences.","Purinergic receptors, represented by several families, are arguably the most abundant receptors in living organisms and appeared early in evolution. After slow acceptance, purinergic signalling in both peripheral and central nervous systems is a rapidly expanding field. Here, we emphasize purinergic co-transmission, mechanisms of release and breakdown of ATP, ion channel and G-protein-coupled-receptor subtypes for purines and pyrimidines, the role of purines and pyrimidines in neuron-glial communication and interactions of this system with other transmitter systems. We also highlight recent data involving purinergic signalling in pathological conditions, including pain, trauma, ischaemia, epilepsy, migraine, psychiatric disorders and drug addiction, which we expect will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for these disorders with novel mechanisms of action.","Although psychostimulants alleviate the core symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), recent studies confirm that their impact on the long-term outcomes of ADHD children is null. Psychostimulants enhance extracellular dopamine. Numerous review articles assert that they correct an underlying dopaminergic deficit of genetic origin. This dopamine-deficit theory of ADHD is often based upon an overly simplistic dopaminergic theory of reward. Here, I question the relevance of this theory regarding ADHD. I underline the weaknesses of the neurochemical, genetic, neuropharmacological and imaging data put forward to support the dopamine-deficit hypothesis of ADHD. Therefore, this hypothesis should not be put forward to bias ADHD management towards psychostimulants.","Most prior research on the neurobiology of addiction has focused on the role of subcortical systems, such as the amygdala, the ventral striatum and mesolimbic dopamine system, in promoting the motivation to seek drugs. Recent evidence indicates that a largely overlooked structure, the insula, plays a crucial part in conscious urges to take drugs. The insula has been highlighted as a region that integrates interoceptive (i.e. bodily) states into conscious feelings and into decision-making processes that involve uncertain risk and reward. Here, we propose a model in which the processing of the interoceptive effects of drug use by the insula contributes to conscious drug urges and to decision-making processes that precipitate relapse.","Over the past three decades, multiple mechanisms limiting central nervous system regeneration have been identified. Here, we address plasticity arising from spared systems as a particularly important and often unrecognized mechanism that potentially contributes to functional recovery in studies of 'regeneration' after spinal cord injury. We then discuss complexities involved in translating findings from animal models to human clinical trials in spinal cord injury; current strategies might be too limited in scope to yield detectable benefits in the complex and variable arena of human injury. Our animal models are imperfect, and the very variability that we attempt to control in the course of conducting rigorous research might, ironically, limit our ability to identify the most promising therapies in the human arena. Therapeutic candidates are most likely to have a detectable effect in human trials if they elicit benefits in severe contusion and larger animal models and pass the test of independent replication.","Two of the most striking properties of the cerebellum are its control in timing of motor operations and its ability to adapt behavior to new sensorimotor associations. Here, we propose a 'time-window matching' hypothesis for granular layer processing. Our hypothesis states that mossy fiber inputs to the granular layer are transformed into well-timed spike bursts by intrinsic granule cell processing, that feedforward Golgi cell inhibition sets a limit to the duration of such bursts and that these activities are spread over particular fields in the granular layer so as to generate ongoing time-windows for proper control of interacting motor domains. The role of synaptic plasticity would be that of fine-tuning pre-wired circuits favoring activation of specific granule cell groups in relation to particular time windows. This concept has wide implications for processing in the olivo-cerebellar system as a whole.","Thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is used for the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that, besides the unquestionable benefit from its thrombolytic activity, tPA also has a deleterious effect on the ischemic brain including cytotoxicity and increased permeability of the neurovascular unit with the development of cerebral edema. Because an increasing number of acute stroke patients are treated with tPA, it is important to know the mechanisms of harmful effects of tPA on the ischemic brain. Here, the best studied pathways of tPA neurotoxicity are discussed along with future directions for a safer use of tPA as a thrombolytic agent in the setting of acute ischemic stroke.","We review the practical application of the tools for studying the genetic epidemiology of complex disease. Whole-genome association studies highlight the need to understand the genetic epidemiology. Elucidating the genetic basis of disease anticipated from these studies has been incomplete, and the importance of the environment and its potential interaction with genes cannot be overlooked. Multiple sclerosis yields several key lessons including how epistatic effects might overshadow the small effects of genes identified from whole-genome association studies. We reinterpret twin studies and demonstrate the use and advantages of adoptee, half-sibling and avuncular-pair studies. These show that the environment acts at a population level, strongly indicating epigenetic modifications to germline susceptibility. There is good reason to think that such interactions will be within the major histocompatibility complex, in which strong epistatic effects have already been demonstrated. Family-based data in multiple sclerosis are applicable to other neurological traits.","The olivo-cerebellar system has been implicated in temporal coordination of task components. Here, we propose a novel model that enables the olivo-cerebellar system to function as a generator of temporal patterns. These patterns could be used for timing of motor, sensory and cognitive tasks. The proposed mechanism for the generation of these patterns is based on subthreshold oscillations in a network of inferior olivary neurons and their control by the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. Our model, which integrates a large body of anatomical and physiological observations, lends itself to simple, testable predictions and provides a new conceptual framework for olivo-cerebellar research.","Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that gradually robs affected individuals of memory, cognitive skills and normal movements. Although research has identified a single faulty gene, the huntingtin gene, as the cause of the disease, a cure remains elusive. Strong evidence indicates that mitochondrial impairment plays a key part in HD pathogenesis. Here, we highlight how mutant huntingtin (mtHtt) might cause mitochondrial dysfunction by either perturbing transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins or by direct interaction with the organelle and modulation of respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca(2+) buffering. In addition, we propose that mtHtt might convey its neurotoxicity by evoking defects in mitochondrial dynamics, organelle trafficking and fission and fusion, which, in turn, might result in bioenergetic failure and HD-linked neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Finally, we speculate how mitochondria might dictate selective vulnerability of long projection neurons, such as medium spiny neurons, which are particularly affected in HD.","During brain development cells divide, differentiate and migrate to their assigned targets to form synapses and active cell assemblies. This sequence is controlled both by genetic programs and environmental factors. Alterations of this sequence by mutations or environmental insults leads to the formation of misconnected circuits endowed with a 'pre-symptomatic signature'. I propose here that early- and late-onset neurological disorders as diverse as infantile epilepsies, mental retardation, dyslexia or, in certain conditions, even Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease might be, in part, born at early developmental stages before symptoms appear. The core of this working hypothesis is that imaging or non-invasive recordings might unravel signatures of disorders to come, thereby permitting earlier diagnosis and potential treatment of neurological disorders.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2008.09.003 PMID: 18945498  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Human evolution is characterized by a rapid increase in brain size and complexity. Decades of research have made important strides in identifying anatomical and physiological substrates underlying the unique features of the human brain. By contrast, it has become possible only very recently to examine the genetic basis of human brain evolution. Through comparative genomics, tantalizing insights regarding human brain evolution have emerged. The genetic changes that potentially underlie human brain evolution span a wide range from single-nucleotide substitutions to large-scale structural alterations of the genome. Similarly, the functional consequences of these genetic changes vary greatly, including protein-sequence alterations, cis-regulatory changes and even the emergence of new genes and the extinction of existing ones. Here, we provide a general review of recent findings into the genetic basis of human brain evolution, highlight the most notable trends that have emerged and caution against over-interpretation of current data.","The largest part of the primate prefrontal cortex has no homolog in other mammals. Accordingly, it probably confers some advantage that other mammals either lack or attain through the function of other structures. Yet, this advantage remains enigmatic. This is not so for other parts of the cortex. For example, certain visual areas encode, represent and store knowledge about objects. By analogy, perhaps the primate prefrontal cortex encodes, represents and stores knowledge about behaviors, including the consequences of doing (or not doing) something in complex and challenging situations. The long list of functions often attributed to the prefrontal cortex could contribute to knowing what to do and what will happen when rare risks arise or outstanding opportunities knock.","Neuroscientists have become increasingly aware of the complexities and subtleties of sensory processing. This applies particularly to the complex elaborations of nerve signals that occur in the sensory circuits, sometimes at the very initial stages of sensory pathways. Sensory processing is now known to be very different from a simple neural copy of the physical signal present in the external world, and this accounts for the intricacy of neural organization that puzzled great investigators of neuroanatomy such as Santiago Ramón Y Cajal a century ago. It will surprise present-day sensory neuroscientists, applying their many modern methods, that the conceptual basis of the contemporary approach to sensory function had been recognized four centuries ago by Galileo Galilei.","Noise contributed by the probabilistic spiking times of neurons has an important and advantageous role in brain function. We go beyond the deterministic noiseless description of the dynamics of cortical networks and show how the properties of the system are influenced by the spiking noise. We review here recent results that show the direct link between brain activity and psychophysically quantified behaviors during a somatosensory detection task. We focus on the following remarkable observation in this somatosensory task: when a near-threshold stimulus is presented, a sensory percept may or may not be produced. These perceptual judgments are believed to be determined by the fluctuation in activity of early sensory cortices. We show, however, that the behavioral outcomes associated with near-threshold stimuli depend on the neuronal fluctuations of more central areas to early somatosensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the behavioral correlate of perceptual detection is given by a noise-driven transition in a multistable neurodynamical system. Thus, neuronal fluctuations can be an advantage for brain processing because they lead to probabilistic behavior in decision making in this and other sensory tasks.","How does the brain encode life experiences? Recent results derived from vital imaging, computational modeling, cellular physiology and systems neuroscience have pointed to local changes in synaptic connectivity as a powerful substrate, here termed micro-rewiring. To examine this hypothesis, I first review findings on micro-structural dynamics with focus on the extension and retraction of dendritic spines. Although these observations demonstrate a biological mechanism, they do not inform us of the specific changes in circuit configuration that might occur during learning. Here, computational models have made testable predictions for both the neuronal and circuit levels. Integrative approaches in the mammalian neocortex and the barn owl auditory localization pathway provide some of the first direct evidence in support of these 'synaptic-clustering' mechanisms. The implications of these data and the challenges for future research are discussed.","Several modes of synaptic vesicle release, retrieval and recycling have been identified. In a well-established mode of exocytosis, termed 'full-collapse fusion', vesicles empty their neurotransmitter content fully into the synaptic cleft by flattening out and becoming part of the presynaptic membrane. The fused vesicle membrane is then reinternalized via a slow and clathrin-dependent mode of compensatory endocytosis that takes several seconds. A more fleeting mode of vesicle fusion, termed 'kiss-and-run' exocytosis or 'flicker-fusion', indicates that during synaptic transmission some vesicles are only briefly connected to the presynaptic membrane by a transient fusion pore. Finally, a mode that retrieves a large amount of membrane, equivalent to that of several fused vesicles, termed 'bulk endocytosis', has been found after prolonged exocytosis. We are of the opinion that both fast and slow modes of endocytosis co-exist at central nervous system nerve terminals and that one mode can predominate depending on stimulus strength, temperature and synaptic maturation.", ,"The nucleus accumbens regulates goal-directed behaviors by integrating information from limbic structures and the prefrontal cortex. Here, we review recent studies in an attempt to provide an integrated view of the control of information processing in the nucleus accumbens in terms of the regulation of goal-directed behaviors and how disruption of these functions might underlie the pathological states in drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders. We propose a model that could account for the results of several studies investigating limbic-system interactions in the nucleus accumbens and their modulation by dopamine and provide testable hypotheses for how these might relate to the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders.","Ionotropic receptors mediate rapid communication between neurons. These receptors are oligomers and are usually assembled from multiple subunit types. Receptors built from different subunit combinations have distinct functional properties, such as single-channel conductances, rates of desensitization and sensitivities to activators and inactivators; they can also have different intracellular locations. Methods are now available for determining not only the subunit stoichiometry but also the subunit arrangement within ionotropic receptors. This information will inform experiments designed to understand the molecular basis of receptor assembly and function. It will also permit the modelling of potential ligand-binding sites at the interfaces between the subunits and should lead to a more rational approach to drug development.",Polyglutamine diseases are a major cause of neurodegeneration worldwide. Recent studies highlight the importance of protein quality control mechanisms in regulating polyglutamine-induced toxicity. Here we discuss a model of disease pathogenesis that integrates current understanding of the role of protein folding in polyglutamine disease with emerging evidence that alterations in native protein interactions contribute to toxicity. We also incorporate new findings on other age-related neurodegenerative diseases in an effort to explain how protein aggregation and normal aging processes might be involved in polyglutamine disease pathogenesis.,"Paralysis of the diaphragm is a severe consequence of cervical spinal cord injury. This condition can be experimentally modeled by lateralized, high cervical lesions that interrupt descending inspiratory drive to the corresponding phrenic nucleus. Although partial recovery of ipsilateral diaphragm function occurs over time, recent findings show persisting chronic deficits in ventilation and phrenic motoneuron activity. Some evidence suggests, however, that spontaneous recovery can be enhanced by modulating neural pathways to phrenic motoneurons via synaptic circuitries which appear more complex than previously envisioned. The present review highlights these and other recent experimental multidisciplinary findings pertaining to respiratory neuroplasticity in the rat. Translational considerations are also emphasized, with specific attention directed at the clinical and interpretational strengths of different lesion models and outcome measures.","Genetic screens in Drosophila have identified many genes involved in neural development and function. However, until recently, it has been impossible to monitor neural signals in Drosophila central neurons, and it has been difficult to make specific perturbations to central neural circuits. This has changed in the past few years with the development of new tools for measuring and manipulating neural activity in the fly. Here we review how these new tools enable novel conceptual approaches to 'cracking circuits' in this important model organism. We discuss recent studies aimed at defining the cognitive demands on the fly brain, identifying the cellular components of specific neural circuits, mapping functional connectivity in those circuits and defining causal relationships between neural activity and behavior.","The 'healthy cell bias of estrogen action' hypothesis examines the role that regulating mitochondrial function and bioenergetics play in promoting neural health and the mechanistic crossroads that lead to divergent outcomes following estrogen exposure. Estrogen-induced signaling pathways in hippocampal and cortical neurons converge upon the mitochondria to enhance aerobic glycolysis coupled to the citric acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Convergence of estrogen-induced signaling onto mitochondria is also a point of vulnerability when activated in diseased neurons which exacerbates degeneration through increased load on dysregulated calcium homeostasis. As the continuum of neurological health progresses from healthy to unhealthy so too do the benefits of estrogen or hormone therapy. The healthy cell bias of estrogen action hypothesis provides a lens through which to assess disparities in outcomes across basic and clinical science and on which to predict outcomes of estrogen interventions for sustaining neurological health and preventing age-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2008.07.005 PMCID: PMC2574933 PMID: 18774186  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Although the role of a genetic factor is established in bipolar disorder, causative genes or robust genetic risk factors have not been identified. Increased incidence of subcortical hyperintensity, altered calcium levels in cells derived from patients and neuroprotective effects of mood stabilizers suggest vulnerability or impaired resilience of neurons in bipolar disorder. Mitochondrial dysfunction or impaired endoplasmic reticulum stress response is suggested to play a role in the neurons' vulnerability. Progressive loss or dysfunction of 'mood-stabilizing neurons' might account for the characteristic course of the illness. The important next step in the neurobiological study of bipolar disorder is identification of the neural systems that are responsible for this disorder.",Memory interference is a common cause of forgetting. Interference is a byproduct of the need to balance the formation of well-differentiated representations against the ability to retrieve memories from cues that are not identical to the original experience. How the brain accomplishes this has remained elusive. Here we review how insights can be gained from studies of an apparently unrelated phenomenon in the rodent brain--remapping in hippocampal place cells. Remapping refers to the formation of distinct representations in populations of place cells after minor changes in inputs to the hippocampus. Remapping might reflect processes involved generally in decorrelation of overlapping signals. These processes might be crucial for storing large numbers of similar experiences with only minimal interference.,"Synapse formation involves reciprocal interactions between cells resulting in formation of a structure optimized for efficient information transfer. Recent work has implicated constituents of the cadherin-catenin cell-adhesion complex in both synapse formation and plasticity. In this review, we describe recent interesting discoveries on mechanisms of cadherin complex function, in addition to regulating adhesion, that are relevant for understanding the role of this complex in synaptogenesis and plasticity. We describe how this complex acts via (i) recruitment/stabilization of intracellular partners; (ii) regulation of intracellular signaling pathways; (iii) regulation of cadherin surface levels, stability and turnover; (iv) stabilization of receptors; and (v) regulation of gene expression. These exciting discoveries provide insights into novel functional roles of the complex beyond regulating cell adhesion.","fMRI is a tool to study brain function noninvasively that can reliably identify sites of neural involvement for a given task. However, to what extent can fMRI signals be related to measures obtained in electrophysiology? Can the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal be interpreted as spatially pooled spiking activity? Here we combine knowledge from neurovascular coupling, functional imaging and neurophysiology to discuss whether fMRI has succeeded in demonstrating one of the most established functional properties in the visual brain, namely directional selectivity in the motion-processing region V5/MT+. We also discuss differences of fMRI and electrophysiology in their sensitivity to distinct physiological processes. We conclude that fMRI constitutes a complement, not a poor-resolution substitute, to invasive techniques, and that it deserves interpretations that acknowledge its stand as a separate signal.","For over a decade, neuroscientific research has focused on processes of apoptosis and its contribution to the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. In the central nervous system, the degree of intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling expresses a cell's individual metabolic stress, whereas activation of the extrinsic death receptor-induced cascade is regarded as a sign of imbalanced cellular networks. Under physiological conditions, most neurons possess death receptors without being sensitive to receptor-mediated apoptosis. This paradox raises two questions: what is the evolutionary advantage of expressing potentially harmful proteins? How is their signaling controlled? This review summarizes the functional relevance of FasL-Fas signaling--a quintessential death ligand/receptor system--in different neurological disease models ranging from traumatic, inflammatory and ischemic to neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, it outlines alternative non-apoptotic Fas signaling, shedding new light on its neuroplastic capacity. Finally, receptor-proximal regulatory proteins are introduced and identified as potential protagonists of disease-modifying neurological therapies.","Studies over the last 40 years have demonstrated that hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is one of the most consistent biological findings in major depression psychiatry, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are still unclear.","Perturbed neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). With advancing age, neurons encounter increased oxidative stress and impaired energy metabolism, which compromise the function of proteins that control membrane excitability and subcellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Toxic forms of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) can induce Ca(2+) influx into neurons by inducing membrane-associated oxidative stress or by forming an oligomeric pore in the membrane, thereby rendering neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis. AD-causing mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilins can compromise these normal proteins in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Emerging knowledge of the actions of Ca(2+) upstream and downstream of Abeta provides opportunities to develop novel preventative and therapeutic interventions for AD.","Exocytotic release of transmitters is mediated by the ternary SNARE complex. The form of this complex is consistent with its function in the positioning of vesicles to the plasma membrane and their fusion to it. Recent advances in single-molecule techniques, however, bring an additional layer of complexity to this process, implicating that there might be various modes of operation. For example, the binary syntaxin-synaptobrevin 2 complex, in addition to the ternary complex containing SNAP25, might enable vesicular docking. Single-molecule techniques allow direct measurements of the distance/extension, rupture force, spontaneous dissociation times and interaction energy for SNARE protein-protein interactions. These measurements are complementary to results and conclusions drawn from other techniques. Consequently, single-molecule techniques promise tremendous opportunities for in vitro investigations of SNARE proteins to improve our understanding of their role in exocytosis.","The brain is noisy. Neurons receive tens of thousands of highly fluctuating inputs and generate spike trains that appear highly irregular. Much of this activity is spontaneous - uncoupled to overt stimuli or motor outputs - leading to questions about the functional impact of this noise. Although noise is most often thought of as disrupting patterned activity and interfering with the encoding of stimuli, recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that noise can play a constructive role - leading to increased reliability or regularity of neuronal firing in single neurons and across populations. These results raise fundamental questions about how noise can influence neural function and computation.","In adult rodents, subventricular zone (SVZ) astrocytes (B cells) function as primary progenitors in the generation of new neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB), where they differentiate into multiple types of interneurons. It has been generally considered that individual adult SVZ stem cells are capable of generating different types of neurons and glial cells. However, recent studies indicate that these adult SVZ primary progenitors are heterogeneous and predetermined to generate specific types of neurons. Surprisingly, OB interneurons are generated by stem cells not only in the walls of the lateral ventricle facing the striatum but also in the rostral migratory stream and walls of the lateral ventricle facing the cortex and the septum. SVZ B cells in different locations within this extensive germinal region generate different kinds of interneurons. General physiological characteristics of major classes of OB interneurons have begun to emerge, but the functional contribution of each subtype remains unknown. The mosaic organization of the SVZ offers a unique opportunity to understand the origin of interneuron diversity and how this assortment of neurons contributes to plasticity of postnatal olfactory circuits.","Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) has been suggested to act as a negative feedback mechanism responsible for globally and uniformly scaling (up or down) the strength of all synapses in the neuron, in compensation for chronically aberrant (too low or too high) levels of activity. Such global scaling preserves the relative strengths of synapses and thus keeps 'Hebbian-like' memory traces (long-term potentiations, LTP, or depressions, LTD). However, new experimental findings demonstrate that HSP can operate locally, controlling each synapse individually. Seemingly, this finding implies that HSP can abolish any modification of synaptic strength (erase LTP/LTD). We propose that dendrites offer an inherent solution to this 'paradox' and that in fact local HSP might confer upon the neuron several surprising benefits, which are demonstrated using computer simulations.","Spinal cord injury causes devastating loss of function and progressive, potentially life-threatening, secondary complications. Although significant preclinical advances continue to be made in cellular and molecular therapies which promote regeneration, plasticity within remaining circuits and how it can be influenced by physical activity is evolving as a key research area. Understanding what constitutes plasticity, and how activity shapes it, has centred primarily on neurons, but evidence is emerging that activity also influences glial cells. Basic and clinical research continue to advance our knowledge of the quality and quantity of physical exercise required to improve function, while mental exercise is emerging as another avenue. Increased understanding of mechanisms driving activity-dependent plasticity will help develop rehabilitative strategies which optimise functional recovery.",Picture yourself on a crowded sideway with people milling about. The acoustic and visual signals generated by the crowd provide you with complementary information about their locations and motion which needs to be integrated. It is not well understood how such inputs from different sensory channels are combined into unified perceptual states. Coherence of oscillatory neural signals might be an essential mechanism supporting multisensory perception. Evidence is now emerging which indicates that coupled oscillatory activity might serve to link neural signals across uni- and multisensory regions and to express the degree of crossmodal matching of stimulus-related information. These results argue for a new view on multisensory processing which considers the dynamic interplay of neural populations as a key to crossmodal integration.,"The GDNF family ligands (GFLs) signal through the canonical signaling receptor Ret and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored co-receptor, GFRalpha. In recent years, signaling by GFLs has been shown to be more complex than originally assumed. The discrepant expression between GFRalphas and Ret has suggested the existence of additional signal-transducing GDNF receptors, such as NCAM. Here we summarize novel functions and Ret-independent signaling mechanisms for GDNF and GFRalpha, focusing on developing neurons. Emerging evidence indicates a prominent role of GDNF and GFRalpha in the control of neuroblast migration and chemoattraction and in the formation of neuronal synapses by a new mechanism of ligand-induced cell adhesion. Therefore, these data highlight the importance of this versatile molecular complex for nervous system development, function and regeneration.","Changes in the structure and function of dendritic spines contribute to numerous physiological processes such as synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as behavior, including learning and memory. Moreover, altered dendritic spine morphogenesis and plasticity is an endophenotype of many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Hence, the molecular mechanisms that control spine plasticity and pathology have been under intense investigation over the past few years. A series of recent studies has improved our understanding of spine dynamics by establishing kalirin-7 as an important regulator of dendritic spine development as well as structural and functional plasticity, providing a model for the molecular control of structural plasticity and implicating kalirin-7 in synaptic pathology in several disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.","Release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the neocortex and hippocampus profoundly alters cellular excitability, network synchronization and behavioral state. Despite its diverse cellular and synaptic targets, the actions of ACh can be highly specific, altering the excitability of distinct inhibitory and excitatory cell types. This review presents evidence for the selectivity of cholinergic neuromodulation in GABAergic interneurons and identifies emerging parallels between the neocortex and hippocampus. In light of growing evidence that neuromodulatory specializations relate to neurochemical identity, I propose that differential engagement of neurochemically distinct interneuron subtypes is a unifying principle by which ACh orchestrates the flow of sensory information in the neocortex and hippocampus.","Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), sometimes described as genetic 'stutters,' are DNA tracts in which a short base-pair motif is repeated several to many times in tandem (e.g. CAGCAGCAG). These sequences experience frequent mutations that alter the number of repeats. Because SSRs are commonly located in promoters, untranslated regions and even coding sequences, such mutations can directly influence almost any aspect of gene function. Mutational expansion of certain triplet repeats is responsible for several hereditary neurodegenerative disorders, but SSR alleles can also contribute to normal variation in brain and behavioral traits. Here we review studies implicating SSRs not just in disease but also in circadian rhythmicity, sociosexual interaction, aggression, cognition and personality. SSRs can affect neuronal differentiation, brain development and even behavioral evolution.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2008 Nov;31(11):549-50; author reply 550-1.,"Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and other melanocortins make up a family of endogenous peptides derived from pro-opiomelanocortin. Through binding to five melanocortin receptors (MCR), these peptides exert multiple influences on the host, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The wide distribution of at least three melanocortin receptor subtypes (MC1R, MC3R and MC4R) in neural, glial and endothelial cells suggests that these receptors could be pharmacological targets for neuroprotective therapies. As a consequence of modulation of NF-kappaB-mediated transcription, melanocortins reduce production of pro-inflammatory agents in brain cells after injury. During brain ischemia, alpha-MSH and other melanocortins exert protective influences with a broad time window. Further, melanocortins rescue neurons subjected to excitotoxic insults, accelerate neurophysiological recovery after spinal cord injury and increase regenerative capacity of peripheral nerves in postlesion repair. Based on their established actions, melanocortins could form a novel class of therapeutic agents for acute and chronic disorders of the nervous system.","White matter is the brain region underlying the gray matter cortex, composed of neuronal fibers coated with electrical insulation called myelin. Previously of interest in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, myelin is attracting new interest as an unexpected contributor to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. This is stimulating research into myelin involvement in normal cognitive function, learning and IQ. Myelination continues for decades in the human brain; it is modifiable by experience, and it affects information processing by regulating the velocity and synchrony of impulse conduction between distant cortical regions. Cell-culture studies have identified molecular mechanisms regulating myelination by electrical activity, and myelin also limits the critical period for learning through inhibitory proteins that suppress axon sprouting and synaptogenesis.","The past 10 years have seen new approaches to elucidating genetic pathways regulating sleep. The emerging theme is that sleep-like states are conserved in evolution, with similar signaling pathways playing a role in animals as distantly related as flies and humans. We review the evidence for the presence of sleep states in non-mammalian species including zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster) and roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans). We describe conserved sleep-regulatory molecular pathways with a focus on cAMP and epidermal growth factor signaling; neurotransmitters with conserved effects on sleep and wake regulation, including dopamine and GABA; and a conserved molecular response to sleep deprivation involving the chaperone protein BiP/GRP78.","Neurons are arguably the most varied cell type both morphologically and functionally. Their fate during differentiation and development and the activity of mature neurons are significantly determined and regulated by chromatin. The nucleus is compartmentalized and the arrangement of these compartments, termed the nuclear architecture, distinguishes one cell type from another and dictates many nuclear processes. Nuclear architecture determines the arrangement of chromosomes, the positioning of genes within chromosomes, the distribution of nuclear bodies and the interplay between these different factors. Importantly, chromatin regulation has been shown to be the basis for a variety of central nervous system processes including grooming and nursing, depression and stress, and drug abuse, among others. Here we review the regulation and function of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure in the context of the nervous system and discuss the potential use of histone deacetylase inhibitors as chromatin-directed therapy for nervous system disorders.","Santiago Ramón y Cajal had referred to neurons as the 'mysterious butterflies of the soul.' Wings of these butterflies--their dendrites--were traditionally considered as passive integrators of synaptic information. Owing to a growing body of experimental evidence, it is now widely accepted that these wings are colorful, endowed with a plethora of active conductances, with each family of these butterflies made of distinct hues and shades. Furthermore, rapidly evolving recent literature also provides direct and indirect demonstrations for activity-dependent plasticity of these active conductances, pointing toward chameleonic adaptability in these hues. These experimental findings firmly establish the immense computational power of a single neuron, and thus constitute a turning point toward the understanding of various aspects of neuronal information processing. In this brief historical perspective, we track important milestones in the chameleonic transmogrification of these mysterious butterflies.","Articulate speech represents a unique trait of our species. Besides other structures, the cerebellum pertains to the brain network engaged in spoken language production. Data from different sources point at a dual role of this organ within the verbal domain: (i) the cerebellum appears to subserve the online sequencing of syllables into fast, smooth and rhythmically organized larger utterances, and (ii) furthermore, the cerebellum seems to participate in the temporal organization of internal speech, that is, a prearticulatory verbal code. Impaired prearticulatory verbal coding mechanisms could explain at least some of the perceptual and cognitive deficits observed in cerebellar disorders. Recent genetic studies indicate that distinct mutations of a specific regulatory gene (FOXP2) promoted the emergence of articulate speech during the course of hominid evolution. Conceivably, structural changes of the expressed FOXP2 protein supported the 'vocal elaboration' of phylogenetically older brain networks engaged in upper limb motor control, such as the cerebro-cerebellar loops.","Barrier mechanisms regulate the exchange of molecules between the brain's internal milieu and the rest of the body. Correct functioning of these mechanisms is critical for normal brain activity, maintenance and development. Dysfunctional brain barrier mechanisms contribute to the pathology of neurological conditions, ranging from trauma to neurodegenerative diseases, and provide obstacles for successful delivery of potentially beneficial pharmaceutical agents. Previous decades of research have yielded insufficient understanding for solving brain barrier problems in vivo. However, an awakening of interest and novel approaches are providing insight into these mechanisms in developing and dysfunctional brain, as well as suggesting new approaches to circumventing brain barrier mechanisms to get therapeutic agents into the central nervous system.","Dopamine is a potentially toxic neurotransmitter that has long been speculated to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent work has demonstrated the importance of proper storage of dopamine in vesicles to maintain dopamine homeostasis, thus protecting neurons from the detrimental effects of dopamine accumulation and breakdown in the cytosol. These studies suggest that factors which affect dopamine storage might increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to further environmental or genetic insults, exacerbating the neuronal degeneration that characterizes PD. This review seeks to revisit the pathogenicity of cytosolic dopamine and further address the critical role of neurotransmitter storage in dopamine-mediated neurotoxicity.","Abnormal neuronal signaling caused by metabolic changes characterizes several neurological disorders, and in some instances metabolic interventions provide therapeutic benefits. Indeed, altering metabolism either by fasting or by maintaining a low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet might reduce epileptic seizures and offer neuroprotection in part because the diet increases mitochondrial biogenesis and brain energy levels. Here we focus on a novel hypothesis that a ketogenic diet-induced change in energy metabolism increases levels of ATP and adenosine, purines that are critically involved in neuron-glia interactions, neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity. Enhancing brain bioenergetics (ATP) and increasing levels of adenosine, an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotective molecule, might help with understanding and treating a variety of neurological disorders.","Understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie the function of central pattern generators (CPGs) presents a formidable challenge requiring sophisticated tools and well-chosen model systems. In this article, we describe recent work on vocalizations of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. These behaviors are driven by sexually differentiated CPGs and are exceptionally well suited to this objective. In particular, a simplified mechanism of vocal production (independent of respiratory musculature) allows straightforward interpretations of nerve activity with respect to behavior. Furthermore, the development of a fictively vocalizing isolated brain, together with the finding of rapid androgen-induced masculinization of female vocalizations, provides an invaluable tool for determining how new behaviors arise from existing circuits.","Cation channels of the TRP superfamily are widely expressed in the nervous system, and important progress has been made in elucidating the gating properties and physiological roles of neuronal TRPs. Recent studies have firmly established the role of temperature-sensitive TRPs (thermoTRPs) as the principal molecular thermometers in the peripheral sensory system, and provided the first molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying the exquisite thermo- and chemosensitivity of these channels. Moreover, accumulating evidence implicates TRP channels in the development of the central nervous system. In particular, Ca(2+) influx via TRPC channels appears to be a critical component of the signalling cascade that mediates the guidance of growth cones and survival of neurons in response to chemical cues such as neurotrophins or Netrin-1.","The morphological development of the cerebral cortex from a primitive neuroepithelium into a complex laminar structure underlying higher cognition must rely on a network of intercellular signaling. Gap junctions are widely expressed during embryonic development and provide a means of cell-cell contact and communication. We review the roles of gap junctions in regulating the proliferation of neural progenitors as well as the migration and differentiation of young neurons in the embryonic cerebral cortex. There is substantial evidence that although gap junctions act in the classical manner coupling neural progenitors, they also act as hemichannels mediating the spread of calcium waves across progenitor cell populations and as adhesive molecules aiding neuronal migration. Gap junctions are thus emerging as multifaceted regulators of cortical development playing diverse roles in intercellular communication.","Aging is the most important risk factor for common neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Aging in the central nervous system has been associated with elevated mutation load in mitochondrial DNA, defects in mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative damage. These observations support a 'vicious cycle' theory which states that there is a feedback mechanism connecting these events in aging and age-associated neurodegeneration. Despite being an extremely attractive hypothesis, the bulk of the evidence supporting the mitochondrial vicious cycle model comes from pharmacological experiments in which the modes of mitochondrial enzyme inhibition are far from those observed in real life. Furthermore, recent in vivo evidence does not support this model. In this review, we focus on the relationship among the components of the putative vicious cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of mitochondrial defects on oxidative stress.","Gephyrin is a multifunctional protein responsible for molybdenum cofactor synthesis and the clustering of glycine and GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synapses. Based on the structure of its two conserved domains, G and E, gephyrin is thought to form a hexagonal lattice serving as a scaffold for accessory proteins at postsynaptic sites. However, important aspects of gephyrin gene expression, protein structure and regulation, as well as the role of gephyrin in synapse formation and plasticity, remain poorly understood. Here we review the current state of knowledge about gephyrin, highlighting new research avenues based on a different structural model and a revised nomenclature for gephyrin splice variants. Unraveling the biology of gephyrin will further our understanding of glycinergic and GABAergic synapses in health and disease.","Loss of function after neurological injury frequently occurs through the interruption of axonal connectivity, rather than through cell loss. Functional deficits persist because a multitude of inhibitory factors in degenerating myelin and astroglial scar prevent axonal growth in the adult brain and spinal cord. Given the high clinical significance of achieving functional recovery through axonal growth, substantial research effort has been, and will be, devoted toward this desirable goal. Unfortunately, the labels commonly used in the literature to categorize post-injury axonal anatomy might hinder advancement. In this article, we present an argument for the importance of developing precise terms that describe axonal growth in terms of the inciting event, the distance of axonal extension and the timing of axonal growth. The phenotypes produced by molecular interventions that overcome astroglial scar or myelin-associated inhibitors are reframed and discussed in this context.","RNA editing appears to be the major mechanism by which environmental signals overwrite encoded genetic information to modify gene function and regulation, particularly in the brain. We suggest that the predominance of Alu elements in the human genome is the result of their evolutionary co-adaptation as a modular substrate for RNA editing, driven by selection for higher-order cognitive function. We show that RNA editing alters transcripts from loci encoding proteins involved in neural cell identity, maturation and function, as well as in DNA repair, implying a role for RNA editing not only in neural transmission and network plasticity but also in brain development, and suggesting that communication of productive changes back to the genome might constitute the molecular basis of long-term memory and higher-order cognition.","Many risk genes interact synergistically to produce schizophrenia and many neurotransmitter interactions have been implicated. We have developed a circuit-based framework for understanding gene and neurotransmitter interactions. NMDAR hypofunction has been implicated in schizophrenia because NMDAR antagonists reproduce symptoms of the disease. One action of antagonists is to reduce the excitation of fast-spiking interneurons, resulting in disinhibition of pyramidal cells. Overactive pyramidal cells, notably those in the hippocampus, can drive a hyperdopaminergic state that produces psychosis. Additional aspects of interneuron function can be understood in this framework, as follows. (i) In animal models, NMDAR antagonists reduce parvalbumin and GAD67, as found in schizophrenia. These changes produce further disinhibition and can be viewed as the aberrant response of a homeostatic system having a faulty activity sensor (the NMDAR). (ii) Disinhibition decreases the power of gamma oscillation and might thereby produce negative and cognitive symptoms. (iii) Nicotine enhances the output of interneurons, and might thereby contribute to its therapeutic effect in schizophrenia.","The Nogo receptor (NgR), which was identified as a common receptor for three axon growth inhibitors associated with myelin, has been extensively characterized for its role in triggering growth cone collapse and arresting neurite/axon growth. Recent studies indicate that NgR is also expressed in nonneuronal cells and modulates macrophage responses during inflammation after peripheral nerve injury. In this article, we discuss the possibility that NgR might have wider effects on inflammation in a variety of neurological conditions ranging from central nervous system trauma to diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease.","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) enable mammalian cells to sense pathogenic challenges. They are essential for appropriate initiation, execution and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Whereas TLR-mediated processes in the central nervous system (CNS) might contribute to detrimental (auto)immune reactions, they are unlikely to have exclusively neurodestructive consequences. Indeed, appropriately controlled TLR signaling might be crucial for preserving CNS structure and function in certain contexts. Recent findings illustrate neuroprotective capacities for TLRs, mediated by containment of trauma-associated infection or by recruitment of neuroprotective T lymphocytes. By the latter mechanism, endogenous or therapeutically administered TLR ligands could conceivably generate neuroprotective benefits in noninfectious CNS disorders. This article focuses on the yet less-addressed protective potential of TLR engagement within the CNS.","In this paper, we provide an overview of how the maturation of specific brain regions and stress exposure during windows of vulnerability initiate a series of events that render adolescents exceptionally susceptible to the development of depression. This stress-incubation/corticolimbic development cascade provides a means of understanding why depression emerges with such force and frequency in adolescence. The development of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and ventral striatum is described from a translational perspective as they relate to stress exposure, onset, pathogenesis and gender differences in depression. Adolescent depression is a serious recurrent brain-based disorder. Understanding the genesis and neurobiological basis is important in the development of more effective intervention strategies to treat or prevent the disorder.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease where motor neurons within the brain and spinal cord are lost, leading to paralysis and death. Certain growth factors should, in principle, be able to protect dying motor neurons. However, targeted delivery to the spinal cord or brain has been a constant problem. There is also accumulating evidence that glial cells might play a crucial role in maintaining motor neuron function and survival in ALS. Stem cells isolated and expanded in culture can be modified to release growth factors and generate glial cells following transplantation into the spinal cord or brain. As such, they might be able to both detoxify the local environment around dying motor neurons and deliver trophic factors. Here we examine the feasibility of translating these findings into new treatments for ALS patients.","It is often stated that short-term memory is consolidated in a protein-synthesis-dependent manner into long-term memory. Alternatively, memories might consist of distinct molecular traces that last for different periods of time. These traces can be graded by their 'volatility'; traces encoded by activation of protein kinases are more volatile than traces encoded by morphological changes at preexisting synapses. The least volatile ('static') traces are due to the generation and stabilization of new synapses. Importantly, whereas at the cellular level these traces are generated independently of each other, they might be linked at the network level where volatile memory traces are required to set up a cellular network that is in turn required to induce the static memory trace.","Investigation of the basic mechanisms of chronic pain not only provides insights into how the brain processes and modulates sensory information but also provides the basis for designing novel treatments for currently intractable clinical conditions. Human brain imaging studies have revealed new roles of cortical neuronal networks in chronic pain, including its unpleasant quality, and mouse studies have provided molecular and synaptic mechanisms underlying relevant cortical plasticity. This review paper will critically examine the current literature and propose a cortical network model for chronic pain.","Several theories have proposed possible functions of adult neurogenesis in learning processes on a systems level, such as the avoidance of catastrophic interference and the encoding of temporal and contextual information, and in emotional behavior. Under the assumption of such functionality of new neurons, the question arises: what are the consequences of adult hippocampal neurogenesis beyond the temporally immediate computational benefit? What might provide the evolutionary advantage of maintaining neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus but almost nowhere else? I propose that over the course of life, activity-dependently regulated adult neurogenesis reveals its true significance in the retained ability for lasting and cumulative network adaptations. The hippocampal precursor cells that generate new neurons with their particular acute function represent a 'neurogenic reserve': the potential to remain flexible and plastic in hippocampal learning when the individual is exposed to novelty and complexity.","Some animals never exhibit a state that meets the behavioral definition of sleep. Others suspend or greatly reduce 'sleep' behavior for many weeks during the postpartum period or during seasonal migrations without any consequent 'sleep debt.' Rats die from one form of sleep deprivation, but sleep loss has not been shown to cause death in well-controlled studies in other vertebrate species. Some marine mammal species do not show evidence for REM sleep, and convincing evidence for this state in reptiles, fish and insects is lacking. The enormous variation in the nature of rest and sleep states across the animal kingdom and within the mammalian class has important implications for understanding the evolution and functions of sleep.","Genetic studies have identified several of the genes associated with malformations of cortical development which might disrupt each of the main stages of cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration and late cortical organization. The largest malformation groups, focal cortical dysplasia, heterotopia and polymicrogyria, express different perturbations of these stages and carry a variable propensity for lacking activation, preservation or reorganization of cortical function and for atypical cortical organization. Some patients have obvious neurological impairment, whereas others show unexpected deficits that are detectable only by screening. Drug-resistant epilepsy is frequent but might be amenable to surgical treatment. However, the epileptogenic zone might include remote cortical and subcortical regions. Completeness of resection, a key factor for successful surgery, might be difficult, especially in proximity to eloquent cortex. Surgical planning should be based on assessments of structural imaging and of the major functions relevant to the area in question in any such patient.","Antisocial aggression is a widespread and expensive social problem. Although aggressive behaviors and temperament are highly heritable, clinical and trait associations for the most promising candidate gene for aggression, MAOA, have been largely inconsistent. We suggest that limitations inherent to that approach might be overcome by using multimodal neuroimaging to characterize neural mechanisms of genetic risk. Herein, we detail functional, structural and connectivity findings implicating the low-expressing allele of the MAOA u-VNTR (MAOA-L) in adversely prejudicing information processing within a corticolimbic circuit composed of amygdala, rostral cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. We propose that the MAOA-L, by causing an ontogenic excess of 5-hydroxytryptamine, labilizes critical neural circuitry for social evaluation and emotion regulation (the 'socioaffective scaffold'), thereby amplifying the effects of adverse early-life experience and creating deleterious sociocognitive biases. Our construct provides a neurobiologically consistent model for gene-environment interactions in impulsive aggression.","Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous, behaviorally defined, neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in 1 in 150 children. Individuals with autism have deficits in social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication and have restricted or stereotyped patterns of behavior. They might also have co-morbid disorders including intellectual impairment, seizures and anxiety. Postmortem and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted the frontal lobes, amygdala and cerebellum as pathological in autism. However, there is no clear and consistent pathology that has emerged for autism. Moreover, recent studies emphasize that the time course of brain development rather than the final product is most disturbed in autism. We suggest that the heterogeneity of both the core and co-morbid features predicts a heterogeneous pattern of neuropathology in autism. Defined phenotypes in larger samples of children and well-characterized brain tissue will be necessary for clarification of the neuroanatomy of autism.","Classically, neurons communicate by anterograde conduction of action potentials. However, information can also pass backward along axons, a process that is essential during the development of the nervous system. Here we propose a role for such 'retroaxonal' signals in adult learning. We hypothesize that strengthening of a neuron's output synapses stabilizes recent changes in the same neuron's inputs. During learning, the input synapses of many neurons undergo transient changes, resulting in altered spiking activity. If this in turn promotes strengthening of output synapses, the recent synaptic changes will be stabilized; otherwise they will decay. A representation of sensory stimuli therefore evolves that is tailored to the demands of behavioral tasks. We describe a candidate molecular mechanism for this process involving the activation of CREB by retrograde neurotrophin signals.","Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide hope as a potential regenerative therapy for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury. Currently, ESC-based nervous system repair faces several problems. One major hurdle is related to problems in generating large and defined populations of the desired types of neurons from human ESCs (hESCs). Moreover, survival of grafted hESC-derived cells has varied and functional recovery in recipient animals has often been disappointing. Importantly, in clinical trials, adverse effects after surgery, including tumors or vigorous immune reactions, must be avoided. Here we highlight attempts to overcome these hurdles with hESCs intended for central nervous system repair. We focus on hESC-derived dopamine-producing neurons that can be grafted in Parkinson's disease and identify critical experiments that need to be conducted before clinical trials can occur.","We outline a unified model for inside-out layering of the neocortex, hinging on a new interpretation for the effects of Reelin on neuronal migrations. The effects of Reelin on cortical structure have been analyzed in great detail, but it has been unclear how individual migrating cells respond to Reelin. In our opinion, many published results might be explained if Reelin acts on neurons when their leading processes reach the marginal zone. Reelin then stimulates two parallel events: detachment from radial glia and translocation of the cell soma to the top of the developing cortical plate. This 'detach and go' model explains many aspects of inside-out lamination, defects in the Reeler mutant and results of recent genetic and in utero experiments.","Postmitotic cortical neurons that fail to initiate migration can remain near their site of origin and form persistent periventricular nodular heterotopia (PH). In human telencephalon, this malformation is most commonly associated with Filamin-A (FLNa) mutations. The lack of genetic animal models that reliably produce PH has delayed our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This review examines PH pathogenesis using a new mouse model. Although PH have not been observed in Flna-deficient mice generated thus far, the loss of MEKK4, a regulator of Flna, produces striking PH in mice and offers insight into the mechanisms involved in neuronal migration initiation. Elucidating the basic functions of FLNa and associated molecules is crucial for understanding the causes of PH and for developing prevention for at-risk patients.","Wiring up the nervous system depends on the precise guidance of axonal growth cones to their targets. A key mechanism underlying this guidance is chemotaxis, whereby growth cones detect and follow molecular gradients. Although recent work has uncovered many of the molecules involved in this process, the mechanisms underlying chemotactic axon guidance are still unclear. Here we compare growth cones with neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum, systems for which a clear conceptual framework for chemotaxis has recently emerged. This analogy suggests particular ways in which the three key steps of directional sensing, polarisation and motility might be implemented in chemotaxing growth cones.","Fast synaptic current at most excitatory synapses in the brain is carried by AMPA and NMDA subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs and NMDARs). During development there is an increase in the ratio of AMPAR- to NMDAR-mediated current at these synapses. Recent studies indicate that NMDAR signaling early in development negatively regulates AMPAR expression and function at multiple levels, which likely accounts for the small AMPAR current at developing synapses. This contrasts with the positive role of NMDAR signaling in recruiting AMPARs to synapses during long-term potentiation in the adult brain. Thus, NMDARs exert differential effects on the recruitment of AMPA receptors to synapses depending on the developmental state of the neural circuit.","The past decades have brought several advances to the treatment of epilepsy. However, despite the continued development and release of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), more than one-third of patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, current AEDs do not prevent the development and progression of epilepsy. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new therapies for AED-resistant patients, for prevention of epilepsy in patients at risk and for disease modification. Cell replacement and gene therapies have been proposed to offer potential approaches for improvements in therapy, but are such approaches really more promising than new pharmacological strategies? Here we critically review and discuss data from epilepsy models and human tissue studies indicating that cell and gene therapies might provide alternative therapeutic approaches for AED-resistant focal epilepsies and might have antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying potential. However, several crucial issues remain to be resolved to develop cell and gene therapies into effective and safe therapies.", ,"Accumulating evidence of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization on the one hand and perfect functionality of monomeric receptors on the other creates an impression of controversy. However, the GPCR superfamily is extremely diverse, both structurally and functionally. The life cycle of each receptor includes many stages: synthesis, quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum, maturation in the Golgi, delivery to the plasma membrane (where it can be in the inactive or active state, in complex with cognate G protein, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase or arrestin), endocytosis and subsequent sorting in endosomes. Different GPCR subtypes, and even the same receptor at different stages of its life cycle, most likely exist in different oligomerization states, from monomers to dimers and possibly higher-order oligomers.","The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is expressed on many cell types and can influence a variety of cellular functions. This receptor can mediate cell survival or cell death, can promote or inhibit axonal growth and can facilitate or attenuate proliferation, depending on the cell context. The emerging picture regarding p75(NTR) indicates that it can partner with different coreceptors to dictate specific responses. It then signals by recruiting intracellular binding proteins to activate different signaling pathways. The function of p75(NTR) has mainly been studied in neurons; however, it is also expressed in a variety of glial populations, especially during development and after injury, where its roles have been poorly defined. In this review, we will examine the potential roles for p75(NTR) in glial function.","Intensive mapping of the essential cerebellar brain circuits for Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning appeared relatively complete by 2000, but new data indicate the need for additional differentiation of cerebellar regions and mechanisms coding delay and trace conditioning. This is especially important, as trace conditioning is an experimentally tractable model of declarative learning. The temporal gap in trace eyeblink conditioning may be bridged by forebrain regions through pontine-cerebellar nuclear connections that can bypass cerebellar cortex, whereas a cerebellar cortical long-term-depression-like process appears to be required to support normal delay conditioning. Experiments focusing on the role of cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei in delay versus trace conditioning add perspective on brain substrates of these seemingly similar paradigms, which differ only by a brief stimulus-free time gap between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. This temporal gap appears to impose forebrain dependencies and differentially engage different cerebellar circuitry during acquisition of conditioned responses.","Corticosteroids - secreted after stress - have profound effects on brain and behavior. These effects are mediated by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, which are abundantly expressed in limbic neurons. The role of mineralocorticoid receptors in higher brain functions has never been well understood. Here we argue that the recently discovered low-affinity membrane version of the mineralocorticoid receptor contributes to the initial phase of the stress reaction; this is complemented by the glucocorticoid receptor which terminates the stress response. This concept may explain why human carriers of a mineralocorticoid receptor gene variant display enhanced neuroendocrine and autonomic responsiveness to a psychological stressor.","The extracellular matrix of the central nervous system (CNS) serves as both a supporting structure for cells and a rich source of signaling molecules that can influence cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. A large proportion of this matrix is composed of proteoglycans--proteins with long chains of polysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), covalently attached. Although many of the activities of proteoglycans depend on their core proteins, GAGs themselves can influence cell signaling. Here we review accumulating evidence that two GAGs, chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan, play essential roles during nervous system development but also accumulate in chronic CNS lesions and inhibit axonal regeneration and remyelination, making them significant hindrances to CNS repair. We propose that the balance between the synthesis and degradation of these molecules dictates, in part, how regeneration and recovery from CNS damage occurs.","The discovery that mice lacking rods and cones are capable of regulating their circadian rhythms by light provided the conceptual framework for the discovery of an entirely new photoreceptor system within the mammalian eye. We now know that a small subset of retinal ganglion cells are directly photosensitive and utilize an opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment called melanopsin maximally sensitive in the blue part of the spectrum. We also know that these photosensitive retinal ganglion cells mediate a broad range of physiological responses to light, ranging from the regulation of circadian rhythms to pupil constriction. Most recently, it has become clear that the melanopsins are only distantly related to visual pigments and in terms of their biochemistry share more in common with invertebrate photopigments. Here we outline the discovery of this remarkable new photoreceptor system, review the structure of melanopsin and conclude with a working model of melanopsin phototransduction.","About 80% of the brain is water. This review discusses the importance of the three brain water-channel proteins (AQP1, AQP4, AQP9) in brain physiology. AQP1 is expressed in the choroid plexus and participates in forming cerebrospinal fluid. AQP4, found in astrocyte foot processes, glia limitans and ependyma, facilitates water movement into and out of the brain, accelerates astrocyte migration and alters neuronal activity. Recently, AQP4 autoantibodies were discovered in patients with neuromyelitis optica, a demyelinating disease, and are now being used to diagnose this condition. AQP9 is present in some glia and neurons, but its function is unclear. Finally, we discuss how the discovery of AQP activators and inhibitors will be the next major step in this field.","Calcium signaling is critical for all cells. As a free ion (Ca(2+)), calcium links many physiological stimuli to their intracellular effectors by interacting with binding proteins whose occupancy determines the cellular effect of stimulation. Because binding site occupancy depends on the history of Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]), Ca(2+) dynamics are critical. Calcium dynamics depend on the functional interplay between Ca(2+) transport and buffering systems whose activities depend nonlinearly on [Ca(2+)]. Thus, understanding Ca(2+) dynamics requires detailed information about these Ca(2+) handling systems and their regulation in intact cells. However, effective methods for measuring and characterizing intracellular Ca(2+) handling have not been available until recently. Using concepts relating voltage-gated ion-channel activity to membrane potential dynamics, we developed such methods to analyze Ca(2+) fluxes in intact cells. Here we describe this approach and applications to understanding depolarization-induced Ca(2+) responses in sympathetic neurons.","The proper development of the nervous system requires precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. In different experimental model systems, microRNAs (miRNAs) - a class of small, endogenous, noncoding RNAs that control the translation and stability of many mRNAs - are emerging as important regulators of various aspects of neuronal development. Further dissection of the in vivo physiological functions of individual miRNAs promises to offer novel mechanistic insights into the gene regulatory networks that ensure the precise assembly of a functional nervous system.","The mammalian nervous system expresses numerous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). We propose that ncRNAs are capable of coupling the digital information universe of nucleic acids with the analog universe of cellular protein interactions. ncRNAs could contribute to the success of the organism's information processing in several ways. First, ncRNAs would allow for efficient coupling of energy with information, wherein less energy is required to represent and process more information, condensed in analog and digital form, into smaller spatial and temporal domains, ideal for the environments found in neural tissues. Second, ncRNAs would permit the rapid acquisition of information from the environment, along with the rapid flexible processing and elimination of that information when it is no longer necessary. Third, ncRNAs would facilitate accelerated evolution of an organism's information content and functional computational systems. This emerging panorama might open new dimensions of information processing in the nervous system.","Novel findings on the effects of inflammatory molecules on neuronal circuits, and on molecular interactions between immunity and sleep, in health and disease, shed light on the pathogenesis of disorders of past (encephalitis lethargica) and present concern (human African trypanosomiasis and narcolepsy), which share alterations in sleep-wakefulness transitions. Although these three disorders differ in etiology, synaptic interactions with immune-response-derived molecules could play a pathogenetic role. Knowledge obtained on neural-immune interplay during senescence also has implications for age-related sleep dysregulation, which is common in the elderly population. Altogether, the data indicate that cell groups implicated in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, circadian timing, and their interactions could be sensitive to synaptic effects of immune molecules.","Much research effort into synaptic plasticity has been motivated by the idea that modifications of synaptic weights (or strengths or efficacies) underlie learning and memory. Here, we examine the possibility of exploiting the statistics of experimentally measured synaptic weights to deduce information about the learning process. Analysing distributions of synaptic weights requires a theoretical framework to interpret the experimental measurements, but the results can be unexpectedly powerful, yielding strong constraints on possible learning theories as well as information that is difficult to obtain by other means, such as the information storage capacity of a cell. We review the available experimental and theoretical techniques as well as important open issues.","Kainate receptors (KARs), together with AMPA and NMDA, are typically described as ionotropic glutamate receptors. The functions of KARs have begun to be elucidated only in the last decade. Although some the actions of KARs are classically ionotropic, surprisingly others seem to involve the activation of second-messenger cascades and invoke metabotropic roles for this type of glutamate receptor. In this review, we describe these metabotropic actions of KARs in relation to the putative signalling cascades involved. Although it is still a mystery how KARs activate G proteins to stimulate second-messenger cascades, intriguingly, in very recent studies, specific subunits of KARs have been demonstrated to associate with G proteins. Altogether, the body of evidence supports the hypothesis that, together with the canonical ionotropic operation, KARs expedite long-lasting signalling by novel metabotropic modes of action.","Converging lines of evidence suggest that auditory system short-term plasticity can enable several perceptual and cognitive functions that have been previously considered as relatively distinct phenomena. Here we review recent findings suggesting that auditory stimulation, auditory selective attention and cross-modal effects of visual stimulation each cause transient excitatory and (surround) inhibitory modulations in the auditory cortex. These modulations might adaptively tune hierarchically organized sound feature maps of the auditory cortex (e.g. tonotopy), thus filtering relevant sounds during rapidly changing environmental and task demands. This could support auditory sensory memory, pre-attentive detection of sound novelty, enhanced perception during selective attention, influence of visual processing on auditory perception and longer-term plastic changes associated with perceptual learning.","Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, a small number of cells dispersed in the hypothalamic region of the basal forebrain, play an important role in reproductive function. These neurons originate in the nasal placode and migrate, first in the nasal compartment, then through the cribriform plate and finally through the basal forebrain, before they attain their positions in the hypothalamus. Their movement through changing molecular environments suggests that numerous factors are involved in different phases of their migration. In humans, failure of GnRH neurons to migrate normally results in delayed or absent pubertal maturation and infertility. Advances in genetic and molecular biologic techniques in this decade have allowed us to gain insights into several molecules that affect the migration of GnRH neurons and, consequently, play a role in the establishment and maintenance of reproductive function.","The phosphatase and tensin homologue PTEN was originally identified as a tumor suppressor. In the CNS, mutation or inactivation of PTEN is best known for playing a tumorigenic role in the molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma. However, recent studies show that PTEN is associated with several brain diseases other than cancer, suggesting a broader role of PTEN in CNS pathophysiology. Here, we review the evidence for the crucial involvement of PTEN in neuronal injury as well as in neurological and psychiatric disorders, and discuss the potential of PTEN as a molecular target for the development of a novel CNS therapeutic strategy.","SNARE proteins and the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein, Munc18-1, are essential components of the mammalian secretion machinery. Until recently, quite divergent working models existed for the central but rather isolated role of Munc18-1 in secretion and its relation to the SNAREs. New studies now solve old discrepancies, bring consensus among SM-SNARE interactions and emphasize how closely these proteins work together. Together, SM and SNARE proteins control each step in the exocytotic pathway as a team. Munc18-1 operates as the chief commander of the exocytotic SNARE team, making teamwork more efficient, working with specific team members on specific jobs, reducing promiscuity with members of noncognate teams, and adjusting team efforts as a function of recent history and environmental cues (presynaptic receptor activation).","In recent years, proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has attained prominence as a new molecular mechanism that regulates many vital functions of the nervous system, including development of synaptic connections and synaptic plasticity. Here, we review the latest findings on the role of proteolysis in sculpting the nervous system through control of axonal growth, axonal and dendritic pruning, and regulation of synaptic size and number. We also discuss how protein degradation functions in synaptic plasticity and the roles of local proteolysis in neuronal compartments. In addition, we describe how proteolysis is associated with Alzheimer's disease and ataxia. Furthermore, we highlight the recent approaches that exploit components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for amelioration of these diseases in animal models.","Recent findings indicate that neurons are not merely passive targets of microglia but rather control microglial activity. The variety of different signals that neurons use to control microglia can be divided into two categories: 'Off' signals constitutively keep microglia in their resting state and antagonize proinflammatory activity. 'On' signals are inducible and include purines, chemokines, glutamate. They instruct microglia activation under pathological conditions towards a beneficial or detrimental phenotype. Various neuronal signaling molecules thus actively control microglia function, thereby contribute to the inflammatory milieu of the central nervous system. Thus, neurons should be envisaged as key immune modulators in the brain.","Gain-of-function mutations or dysregulated expression of voltage-gated sodium channels can produce neuronal hyperexcitability, leading to acute or chronic pain. The sodium channel Na(v)1.7 is expressed preferentially in most slowly conducting nociceptive neurons and in sympathetic neurons. Gain-of-function mutations in the Na(v)1.7 channel lead to DRG neuron hyperexcitability associated with severe pain, whereas loss of the Na(v)1.7 channel in patients leads to indifference to pain. The contribution of Na(v)1.7 to acquired and inherited pain states and the absence of motor, cognitive and cardiac deficits in patients lacking this channel make it an attractive target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.","Specialized chemo- and nutrient-sensing cells share a common electrophysiological mechanism by transducing low O(2), high CO(2) and low glucose stimuli into a compensatory cellular response: the closing of background K(+) channels encoded by the K(2P) subunits. Inhibition of the TASK K(2P) channels by extracellular acidosis leads to an increased excitability of brainstem respiratory neurons. Moreover, hypoxic down-modulation of TASK channels is implicated in the activation of glomus cells in the carotid body. Stimulation of both types of cell leads to an enhanced ventilation and to cardiocirculatory adjustments. Differential modulation of TASK channels by acidosis and high glucose alters excitability of the hypothalamic orexin neurons, which influence arousal, food seeking and breathing. These recent results shed light on the role of TASK channels in sensing physiological stimuli.","Conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a blunt tool for studying the nervous system because it measures neural activity only indirectly, by way of hemodynamics and neurovascular coupling. Several alternative, nonhemodynamic functional imaging methods are now being explored. The methods are designed to offer better resolution and neuronal specificity than hemodynamic imaging and, in some cases, might report signals from specific molecules or cell populations. Much progress has concentrated in three areas: diffusion-weighted functional imaging; detection of neuronal electromagnetic fields; and molecular imaging of neural metabolites and signaling species. Here, we review recent developments in these areas. We consider unique advantages and disadvantages of 'bloodless fMRI' approaches, as well as their future prospects as experimental tools in cognitive and systems neuroscience.","Neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) drive the reproductive axis, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which hormonal and environmental signals regulate GnRH secretion remain poorly understood. Kisspeptins are products of the Kiss1 gene, and the interaction of kisspeptin and its receptor GPR54 plays a crucial role in governing the onset of puberty and adult reproductive function. This review discusses the latest ideas about kisspeptin-GPR54 signaling in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction, with special emphasis on the role of Kiss1 and kisspeptin in the negative and positive feedback control of gonadotropin secretion by sex steroids, timing of puberty onset, sexual differentiation of the brain and photoperiodic regulation of seasonal reproduction.","Twenty years ago, striatal cholinergic neurons were central figures in models of basal ganglia function. But since then, they have receded in importance. Recent studies are likely to lead to their re-emergence in our thinking. Cholinergic interneurons have been implicated as key players in the induction of synaptic plasticity and motor learning, as well as in motor dysfunction. In Parkinson's disease and dystonia, diminished striatal dopaminergic signalling leads to increased release of acetylcholine by interneurons, distorting network function and inducing structural changes that undoubtedly contribute to the symptoms. By contrast, in Huntington's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, there is a fall in striatal cholinergic markers. This review gives an overview of these recent experimental and clinical studies, placing them within the context of the pathogenesis of movement disorders.","Microglia are the intrinsic immune cells of the brain and express chemokine and cytokine receptors that interact with the peripheral immune cells. Recent studies have indicated that microglia also respond to the brain's classical signalling substances, the neurotransmitters. Here, we review the evidence for the expression of neurotransmitter receptors on microglia and the consequences of this receptor activation for microglial behaviour. It is evident that neurotransmitters instruct microglia to perform distinct types of responses, such as triggering an inflammatory cascade or acquiring a neuroprotective phenotype. Understanding how microglia respond to different neurotransmitters will thus have important implications for controlling the reactivity of these cells in acute injury, as well as for treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2007 Dec;30(12):611.,"Recently, mutations in several genes have been identified as primary causes for the degeneration of motoneurons and their axons. Strikingly, mutations in the same genes were associated with clinically different motoneuron syndromes. The identity of these genes also shed light on the mechanisms of motoneuron degeneration and revealed that overlapping motoneuron phenotypes might be caused by heterogeneous molecular mechanisms. Overall, these findings have challenged the diagnostic classification system set by clinical judgement and triggered the notion of heterogeneity in motoneuron disease. It will now be especially relevant to identify the mechanisms and principles that motoneuron diseases have in common, as this will allow us to identify the most relevant therapeutic targets. On the other hand, heterogeneity in motoneuron disease also implies that finding a monotherapy cure for motoneuron disease will be challenging and that pre-clinical testing of therapeutic targets should not be limited to a single animal model.","Developmental intellectual disability (DID) is a daunting societal problem. Although tremendous progress has been made in defining the genetic causes of DID, therapeutic strategies remain limited. In particular, there is a marked absence of a unified approach to treating cognitive impairments associated with DID. Here, we suggest that the brain in many DID-related disorders is subject to a basic imbalance in neuronal activity, with an increased contribution of inhibition to neural circuits. This over-inhibition, in turn, is predicted to lead to deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We further discuss possibilities for pharmacological intervention in DID, focusing on the concept of drug-induced 'therapeutic neuroadaptation' as a means of stably enhancing constitutive circuit excitability and cognition over time.","How the brain perceives volatile chemicals in the environment to evoke the appropriate behaviour is a fundamental question in sensory neuroscience. The olfactory system of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has emerged as a powerful model system to address this problem. Recent analysis of the molecular, neuroanatomical and physiological properties of the olfactory circuits that detect the sex and social aggregation pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate now provides one of the most comprehensive outlines for the neural basis of odour perception. This review describes these latest advances, discusses what they reveal about where stimulus sensitivity and specificity is encoded in olfactory circuits, and considers future questions.","Understanding how a vast number of neuron types derive from a limited number of neural progenitors remains a major challenge in developmental neurobiology. In the post-embryonic Drosophila brain, specific neuron types derive from specific progenitors at specific times. This suggests involvement of time-dependent cell fate determinants acting as 'temporal codes' along with lineage cues to specify neuronal cell fates. Interestingly, such temporal codes might be provided not only by several regulators acting in sequence, but also by the differential protein levels of the BTB-zinc finger nuclear protein Chinmo. Identifying temporal codes and determining their origins should allow us to elucidate how neuronal diversification occurs through protracted neurogenesis.","The development of stroke drugs has been characterized by success in animal studies and subsequent failure in clinical trials. Animal studies might have overstated efficacy, or clinical trials might have understated efficacy; in either case we need to better understand the reasons for failure. Techniques borrowed from clinical trials have recently allowed the impact of publication and study-quality biases on published estimates of efficacy in animal experiments to be described. On the basis of these data, we propose minimum standards for the range and quality of pre-clinical animal data. We believe the adoption of these standards will lead to improved effectiveness and efficiency in the selection of drugs for clinical trials in stroke and in the design of those trials.","Extremely low-gestational-age newborns have a prominently increased risk of brain dysfunctions attributed to white-matter damage, which is thought to result from the vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte. This white-matter damage now appears to be accompanied by cerebral-cortex and deep-gray-matter abnormalities, including excess apoptosis without replacement and the impairment of surviving neurons and resulting interference with synaptogenesis and connectivity. Recent advances in corticogenesis suggest that neurons migrate from the germinative zones through the white matter to the cortex when the white matter is most vulnerable and perhaps is being injured. Advances in developmental neuroscience also suggest that the excitotoxic and inflammatory processes that probably contribute to white-matter damage are also able to damage developing neurons. Together, these advances support the untested hypothesis that white-matter damage in the preterm newborn is accompanied by the death of neurons as they migrate through the dangerous minefield of white matter undergoing injury.","The ability of neurons to modulate the strength of their synaptic connections has been shown to depend on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. This form of synaptic plasticity, called spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), has become an attractive model for learning at the single-cell level. Yet, despite its popularity in experimental and theoretical neuroscience, the influence of dendritic mechanisms in the induction of STDP has been largely overlooked. Several recent studies have investigated how active dendritic properties and synapse location within the dendritic tree influence STDP. These studies suggest the existence of learning rules that depend on firing mode and subcellular input location, adding unanticipated complexity to STDP. Here, we propose a new look at STDP that is focused on processing at the postsynaptic site in the dendrites, rather than on spike-timing at the cell body.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2007 Oct;30(10):489.,"It has long been proposed that following vesicle fusion, a small pore might open and close rapidly without full dilation. Such 'kiss-and-run' vesicle fusion can in principle result in rapid vesicle recycling and influence the size and the kinetics of the resulting synaptic current. However, the existence of kiss-and-run remains highly controversial, as revealed by recent imaging and electrophysiological studies at several synapses, including hippocampal synapses, neuromuscular junctions and retinal bipolar synapses. Only a minor fraction of fusion events has been shown to be kiss-and-run, as determined using cell-attached capacitance recordings in endocrine cells, pituitary nerve terminals and calyx-type synapses. Further work is needed to determine whether kiss-and-run is a major mode of fusion and has a major role in controlling synaptic strength at synapses.","In 1906, Santiago Ramón y Cajal was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of his work on the structure of neurons and their connections. What is less well known is that he also had a keen interest in glia and developed specific staining methods for their study. In addition to describing their morphology, he speculated on a role for glia in sleep and wakefulness and even in executive brain functions such as attention. In this article, we focus on Cajal's histological research into glial cells; this research includes original drawings of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and radial glia, as well as his scientific writings. We aim to show that, concerning glia as well as neurons, Cajal was far ahead of his time.","The existence of neurotransmitter receptor heteromers is becoming broadly accepted and their functional significance is being revealed. Heteromerization of neurotransmitter receptors produces functional entities that possess different biochemical characteristics with respect to the individual components of the heteromer. Neurotransmitter receptor heteromers can function as processors of computations that modulate cell signaling. Thus, the quantitative or qualitative aspects of the signaling generated by stimulation of any of the individual receptor units in the heteromer are different from those obtained during coactivation. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that some neurotransmitter receptor heteromers can exert an effect as processors of computations that directly modulate both pre- and postsynaptic neurotransmission. This is illustrated by the analysis of striatal receptor heteromers that control striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission.","Synaptic plasticity underlies higher brain functions such as learning and memory. At glutamatergic synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system, plasticity usually requires changes in the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Recently, several studies have revealed that glial cells play an important role in regulating postsynaptic AMPA receptor density. This is accomplished through the release of gliotransmitters such as D-serine, ATP and TNF-alpha. More specifically, the availability of D-serine, the endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in many brain areas, governs the induction of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Meanwhile, ATP and TNF-alpha trigger long-lasting increases in synaptic strength at glutamatergic hypothalamic and hippocampal inputs, respectively, through mechanisms that promote AMPA receptor insertion in the absence of coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. These data clearly demonstrate a vital role for glia in plasticity and argue that their contributions to brain function extend well beyond their outdated role as cellular 'glue'.","Recent data indicate that alcohol dependence induces long-term neuroadaptations that recruit a negative emotional state. This leads to excessive alcohol ingestion motivated by relief of negative emotionality. A key mechanism in this transition to negative reinforcement is a recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling within the amygdala. Long term upregulation of CRF(1) receptors is observed in the amygdala following a history of dependence, and CRF antagonists selectively block emotionality, excessive alcohol drinking and stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in post-dependent animals. Innate upregulation of CRF(1) receptor expression mimics the post-dependent phenotype, both with regard to emotional responses and ethanol self-administration. Therefore, the CRF system is emerging as a key element of the neuroadaptive changes driving alcoholism and as a major target for its treatment.","AMPA-type (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate post-synaptic depolarization and fast excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. AMPARs are tetrameric ion channels that assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a poorly understood process. The subunit composition determines channel conductance properties and gating kinetics, and also regulates vesicular traffic to and from synaptic sites, and is thus critical for synaptic function and plasticity. The distribution of functionally different AMPARs varies within and between neuronal circuits, and even within individual neurons. In addition, synapses employ channels with specific subunit stoichiometries, depending on the type of input and the frequency of stimulation. Taken together, it appears that assembly is not simply a stochastic process. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying subunit assembly and receptor biogenesis in the ER. These processes ultimately determine the size and shape of the postsynaptic response, and are the subject of this review.","The hypothalamus integrates various hormonal and neuronal signals to regulate appetite and metabolism and thereby serves a homeostatic purpose in the regulation of body weight. Additional neural circuits that are superimposed on this system have the potential to override the homeostatic signals, resulting in either gluttony or anorexia at the extremes. Midbrain dopamine neurons have long been implicated in mediating reward behavior and the motivational aspects of feeding behavior. Recent results reveal that hormones implicated in regulating the homeostatic system also impinge directly on dopamine neurons; for example, leptin and insulin directly inhibit dopamine neurons, whereas ghrelin activates them. Here, I discuss the predictions and implications of these new findings as they relate to dopamine signaling and the physiology of appetite control.","Our understanding of the role of GABA signaling in circuit development is rapidly expanding. Here, we review three recent refinements in our understanding of the diverse roles that GABA plays at different stages of neural circuit formation. First, we discuss recent evidence that depolarizing GABA plays at least a permissive role in promoting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis in developing neurons (including newly generated neurons in the adult). Next, we discuss recent evidence that GABAergic circuits sculpt the temporal and spatial aspects of synaptic integration. Consequently, early developmental events affecting the establishment of GABAergic circuits will control subsequent activity-dependent refinements of information processing and circuit function. In the third section, we review recent evidence of molecular mechanisms by which GABAergic signaling plays a role in the regulation of the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in developing circuits. Throughout the review, we concentrate on the effects of the signaling by GABA(A) receptors, as told from the point of view of the GABA-responsive cells, and do not discuss mechanisms that govern GABA release or activity of GABAergic neurons per se.","GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain, implicated in anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, and learning and memory. Here, we present several lines of evidence for involvement of the GABAergic system, and in particular the GABA(A) receptor-mediated function, in fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation. We argue that an altered expression of the GABA(A) receptor has neurophysiologic and functional consequences that might relate to the behavioural and neurological phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome. Interestingly, some neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, epilepsy and sleep disorders, are effectively treated with therapeutic agents that act on the GABA(A) receptor. Therefore, the GABA(A) receptor might be a novel therapeutic target for fragile X syndrome.","Monitoring changes in the fluorescence of metabolic chromophores, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, and the absorption of cytochromes, is useful to study neuronal activation and mitochondrial metabolism in the brain. However, these optical signals evoked by stimulation, seizures and spreading depression in intact brain differ from those observed in vitro. The responses in vivo consist of a persistent oxidized state during neuronal activity followed by mild reduction during recovery. In vitro, however, brief oxidation is followed by prolonged and heightened reduction, even during persistent neuronal activation. In normally perfused, oxygenated and activated brain tissue in vivo, partial pressure of oxygen (P(O2)) levels often undergo a brief 'dip' that is always followed by an overshoot above baseline, due to increased blood flow (neuronal-vascular coupling). By contrast, in the absence of blood circulation, tissue P(O2)in vitro decreases more markedly and recovers slowly to baseline without overshooting. Although oxygen is abundant in vivo, it is diffusion-limited in vitro. The disparities in mitochondrial and tissue oxygen availability account for the different redox responses.","In recent years, new recording technologies have advanced such that, at high temporal and spatial resolutions, oscillations of neuronal networks can be identified from simultaneous, multisite recordings. However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings also depends on the development of new mathematical methods that can extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of network oscillations and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals and potentially productive future directions. This review is part of the INMED and TINS special issue, Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, derived from presentations at the annual INMED and TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection and binding of distributed responses. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","The circuitry within the thalamus creates an intrinsic oscillatory unit whose function depends critically on reciprocal synaptic connectivity between excitatory thalamocortical relay neurons and inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons along with a robust post-inhibitory rebound mechanism in relay neurons. Feedforward and feedback connections between cortex and thalamus reinforce the thalamic oscillatory activity into larger thalamocortical networks to generate sleep spindles and spike-wave discharge of generalized absence epilepsy. The degree of synchrony within the thalamic network seems to be crucial in determining whether normal (spindle) or pathological (spike-wave) oscillations occur, and recent studies show that regulation of excitability in the reticular nucleus leads to dynamical modulation of the state of the thalamic circuit and provide a basis for explaining how a variety of unrelated genetic alterations might lead to the spike-wave phenotype. In addition, given the central role of the reticular nucleus in generating spike-wave discharge, these studies have suggested specific interventions that would prevent seizures while still allowing normal spindle generation to occur. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","Hippocampal 'place cells' systematically shift their phase of firing in relation to the theta rhythm as an animal traverses the 'place field'. These dynamics imply that the neural ensemble begins each theta cycle at a point in its state-space that might 'represent' the current location of the rat, but that the ensemble 'looks ahead' during the rest of the cycle. Phase precession could result from intrinsic cellular dynamics involving interference of two oscillators of different frequencies, or from network interactions, similar to Hebb's 'phase sequence' concept, involving asymmetric synaptic connections. Both models have difficulties accounting for all of the available experimental data, however. A hybrid model, in which the look-ahead phenomenon implied by phase precession originates in superficial entorhinal cortex by some form of interference mechanism and is enhanced in the hippocampus proper by asymmetric synaptic plasticity during sequence encoding, seems to be consistent with available data, but as yet there is no fully satisfactory theoretical account of this phenomenon. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","Parkinson's disease is a common and disabling disorder of movement owing to dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. However, it is still unclear how this denervation perverts normal functioning to cause slowing of voluntary movements. Recent work using tissue slice preparations, animal models and in humans with Parkinson's disease has demonstrated abnormally synchronized oscillatory activity at multiple levels of the basal ganglia-cortical loop. This excessive synchronization correlates with motor deficit, and its suppression by dopaminergic therapies, ablative surgery or deep-brain stimulation might provide the basic mechanism whereby diverse therapeutic strategies ameliorate motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue, Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","Physiological rhythmic activity in cortical circuits relies on GABAergic inhibition to balance excitation and control spike timing. With a focus on recent experimental progress in the hippocampus, here we review the mechanisms by which synaptic inhibition can control the precise timing of spike generation, by way of effects of GABAergic events on membrane conductance ('shunting' inhibition) and membrane potential ('hyperpolarizing' inhibition). Synaptic inhibition itself can be synchronized by way of interactions within networks of GABAergic neurons, and by excitatory neurons. The importance of GABAergic mechanisms for generation of cortical rhythms is now well established. What remains to be resolved is how such inhibitory control of spike timing can be harnessed for long-range fast synchronization, and the relevance of these mechanisms to network function. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","Both theoretical and experimental animal work supports the hypothesis that transient oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz) is closely associated with sensory processing. Recent data from recordings in animals and humans have suggested that gamma-frequency activity also has an important role in attention and both working and long-term memory. The involvement of gamma-band synchronization in various cognitive paradigms in humans is currently being investigated using intracranial and high-density electro- and magnetoencephalography recordings. Here, we discuss recent findings demonstrating human gamma-frequency activity associated with attention and memory in both sensory and non-sensory areas. Because oscillatory gamma-frequency activity has an important role in neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity, it could provide a key for understanding neuronal processing in both local and distributed cortical networks engaged in complex cognitive functions. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","The slow (<1 Hz) oscillation, with its alternating 'up' and 'down' states in individual neurons, is a defining feature of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Although this oscillation is well preserved across mammalian species, its physiological role is unclear. Electrophysiological and computational evidence from the cortex and thalamus now indicates that slow-oscillation 'up' states and the 'activated' state of wakefulness are remarkably similar dynamic entities. This is consistent with behavioural experiments suggesting that slow-oscillation 'up' states provide a context for the replay, and possible consolidation, of previous experience. In this scenario, the T-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent bursts of action potentials that initiate each 'up' state in thalamocortical (TC) neurons might function as triggers for synaptic and cellular plasticity in corticothalamic networks. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).","Central presynaptic terminals harbour synaptic vesicles (SVs) and synapse-specific proteins necessary for neurotransmission. Classically, these elements were thought to reside more or less stably at individual mature synapses, giving rise to the idea that each terminal was essentially an independent functional unit. However, emerging evidence from fluorescence imaging studies in hippocampal cultured neurons is now challenging this view, suggesting that neighbouring synapses along axons share vesicles, and also other synaptic elements, at high levels. This raises the possibility that control of import and export might be an important regulatory target for the maintenance of release sites, modulation of synaptic efficacy and formation of new synaptic contacts. Here, temporal synaptic stability and the functional consequences for presynaptic operation will be considered.","Synaptic development, function and plasticity are highly regulated processes requiring a precise coordination of pre- and postsynaptic events. Recent studies have begun to highlight Wingless-Int (Wnt) signaling as a key player in synapse differentiation and function. Emerging roles of Wnts include the differentiation of synaptic specializations, microtubule dynamics, architecture of synaptic protein organization, modulation of synaptic efficacy and regulation of gene expression. These processes are driven by a variety of Wnt transduction pathways. Combined with a myriad of Wnts and Frizzled receptor family members, these pathways highlight the versatility of Wnt signaling and the potential for combinatorial use of these pathways in different aspects of synapse development and function. The identification of neurons secreting Wnt and those containing molecular components downstream of Frizzled receptors indicates that Wnts can function both as anterograde and retrograde signals. These studies open new avenues for understanding how embryonic morphogens are utilized during the development and function of synaptic networks.","A hallmark feature of vertebrate brain organization is ordered topography, wherein sets of neuronal connections preserve the relative organization of cells between two regions. Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.","Establishment of polarity is an essential process during proliferation, migration and differentiation in neurons, and the signaling pathways leading to polarization of the cytoskeleton are topics of intense research. One key marker for cell polarity is the centrosome, also known as the microtubule-organizing center. Recent discoveries have shown that the position of the centrosome is precisely regulated during neurogenesis, migration and differentiation, leading to the segregation of cell fate factors, efficient nucleokinesis and directed neurite outgrowth, respectively. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of this interesting organelle and propose a model whereby centrosome position, determined by extracellular factors, directs multiple aspects of neuronal development.","Tonically active neurons (TANs) in the primate striatum, which are presumed to be cholinergic interneurons, carry signals that are traditionally considered to be important for reward-related learning. Recent studies investigating the functional properties of TANs in behaving monkeys have shown that other factors beyond motivation can affect their responsiveness. There is now evidence that TAN responses reflect stimulus detection, movement control and recognition of a specific context, suggesting that these local circuit neurons contribute to different computations used in learning and action functions of the striatum. This is consistent with the view that TAN responses could represent an important component of the processes that are responsible for the ability to select the appropriate behavioral response to environmental events.","Homeogenes encode homeoprotein transcription factors that have fundamental roles in development. They are key players in genetic networks that lay out the body plan and also determine morphology and physiology at the cellular and multicellular level. However, homeoproteins share activities that extend beyond transcription, including translation regulation and signalling. For example, homeoproteins participate in the definition of territories in the neuroepithelium and also have a function in axonal guidance. Based on these examples, we propose that homeoproteins are not only morphogenetic transcription factors, but also morphogens themselves.","Learning and memory depend on persistent changes in synaptic strength that require neuronal gene expression. An unresolved question concerns the mechanisms by which activity at synapses is transduced into a nuclear transcriptional response. In the prevailing view, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors have distinct roles in controlling synaptic strength: AMPA receptors effect short-term changes in synaptic strength, whereas NMDA receptors regulate genes that are required for the long-term maintenance of these changes. Here, we review recent data on the roles of these two types of receptor in activity-dependent gene expression. We discuss evidence that signals from NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors are integrated to specify transcriptional responses for particular plasticity related genes.","Parkinson's disease arises from genetic and possibly neurotoxic causes that produce massive cell death of the neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Loss of these neurons is essential for the diagnostic parkinsonian features. Although many genetic mutations have been suggested as causes or risk factors for Parkinson's disease, the low penetrance of some mutations and the low disease concordance in relatives suggests that there must be interactions between multiple factors. We suggest that 'multiple hits' that combine toxic stress, for example, from dopamine oxidation or mitochondrial dysfunction, with an inhibition of a neuroprotective response, such as loss of function of parkin or stress-induced autophagic degradation, underlie selective neuronal death. We discuss the properties of substantia nigra dopamine neurons that might make them particular targets of such multiple hits.","The basic organization of the catecholamine-containing neuronal systems and their axonal projections in the brain was initially worked out using classical histofluorescence techniques during the 1960s and 1970s. The introduction of more versatile immunohistochemical methods, along with a range of highly sensitive tract-tracing techniques, has provided a progressively more detailed picture, making the dopamine system one of the best known, and most completely mapped, neurotransmitter systems in the brain. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current knowledge of the diversity and neurochemical features of the nine dopamine-containing neuronal cell groups in the mammalian brain, their distinctive cellular properties, and their ability to regulate their dopaminergic transmitter machinery in response to altered functional demands and aging.","Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.","Lesioning and psychopharmacological studies suggest a wide range of behavioral functions for ascending midbrain dopaminergic systems. However, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies during specific behavioral tasks demonstrate a more restricted spectrum of dopamine-mediated changes. Substantial increases in dopamine-mediated activity, as measured by electrophysiology or voltammetry, are related to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli. A somewhat slower, distinct electrophysiological response encodes the uncertainty associated with rewards. Aversive events produce different, mostly slower, electrophysiological dopamine responses that consist predominantly of depressions. Additionally, more modest dopamine concentration fluctuations, related to punishment and movement, are seen at 200-18,000 times longer time courses using voltammetry and microdialysis in vivo. Using these responses, dopamine neurotransmission provides differential and heterogeneous information to subcortical and cortical brain structures about essential outcome components for approach behavior, learning and economic decision-making.","The nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system has an essential role in the selection and control of movement sequences, and its degeneration causes the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonian motor symptoms are alleviated by L-DOPA, but this treatment induces motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements). Clinical and experimental findings indicate that the motor complications of L-DOPA pharmacotherapy are triggered by transient and large changes in extracellular DA levels. The disruption of presynaptic DA homeostasis sets in motion a cascade of postsynaptic alterations, which prime the brain for a complicated motor response to dopaminomimetic treatment. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia provides a paradigm to study how the dysregulation of DA release and clearance results in maladaptive neuroplasticity sustaining abnormal patterns of movement.","There are several brain regions that have been implicated in the control of motivated behavior and whose disruption leads to the pathophysiology observed in major psychiatric disorders. These systems include the ventral hippocampus, which is involved in context and focus on tasks, the amygdala, which mediates emotional behavior, and the prefrontal cortex, which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility. Each of these systems has overlapping projections to the nucleus accumbens, where these inputs are integrated under the modulatory influence of dopamine. Here, we provide a systems-oriented approach to interpreting the function of the dopamine system, its modulation of limbic-cortical interactions and how disruptions within this system might underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and drug abuse.", ,"The discovery of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in brain by Arvid Carlsson approximately 50 years ago, and the subsequent insight provided by Paul Greengard into the cellular signalling mechanisms triggered by dopamine, gained these researchers the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000. Dopamine research has had a greater impact on the development of biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology than work on any other neurotransmitter. Neuropsychological views of the role of dopamine in the CNS have evolved from that of a simple reward signal to a more complex situation in which dopamine encodes the importance or 'salience' of events in the external world. Hypofunctional dopamine states underlie Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and there is increasing evidence for dopamine hyperactivity in schizophrenia. Some of the medicines that are most widely used in psychiatry, such as L-DOPA, methylphenidate and neuroleptic drugs, act on dopaminergic mechanisms.","The striatum represents the main input into the basal ganglia. Neurons projecting from the striatum receive a large convergence of afferents from all areas of the cortex and transmit neural information to the basal ganglia output structures. Corticostriatal transmission is essential in the regulation of voluntary movement, in addition to behavioural control, cognitive function and reward mechanisms. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the two main forms of synaptic plasticity, are both represented at corticostriatal synapses and strongly depend on the activation of dopamine receptors. Here, we discuss possible feedforward and feedback mechanisms by which striatal interneurons, in association with striatal spiny neurons and endogenous dopamine, influence the formation and maintenance of both LTP and LTD. We also propose a model in which the spontaneous membrane oscillations of neurons projecting from the striatum (named 'up' and 'down' states), in addition to the pattern of release of endogenous dopamine, bias the synapse towards preferential induction of LTP or LTD. Finally, we discuss how endogenous dopamine crucially influences changes in synaptic plasticity induced by pathological stimuli, such as energy deprivation.","Neurodegenerative disorders involve death of cell bodies, axons, dendrites and synapses, but it is surprisingly difficult to determine the spatiotemporal sequence of events and the causal relationships among these events. Neuronal compartments often crucially depend upon one another for survival, and molecular defects in one compartment can trigger cellular degeneration in distant parts of the neuron. Here, we consider the novel approaches used to understand these biologically complex and technically challenging questions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and polyglutamine disorders. We conclude that there is partial understanding of what degenerates first and why, but that controversy remains the rule not the exception. Finally, we highlight strategies for resolving these fundamental issues.","Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) remain widely accepted vertebrate models for the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie synaptic changes during learning and memory. Although LTD is a phenomenon that occurs in many regions of the CNS, it is clear that the mechanisms recruited in its induction and expression can vary, depending on many factors, including brain region and developmental time point. LTD in the hippocampus and cerebellum is probably the best characterized, although there are also other brain areas where mechanisms of LTD are well understood, and where it is thought to have a functional role.","During the past 30 years, research into developmental disorders has fragmented, emphasizing differences rather than commonalities. We propose that reunification might be achieved by using a ""neural-systems"" approach. Deficits in dyslexia are attributed to an intact declarative learning system combined with an impaired procedural learning system--a network that includes prefrontal language systems and basal ganglia, parietal and cerebellar structures. A typology is provided for other prevalent learning disabilities; this framework focuses on different learning skills in the understanding of learning disabilities and emphasizes the diagnostic significance of ""secondary"" symptoms. This approach highlights the need for development of ""neurocognitive"" tests to probe the function of components of each neural system and improve strategies for explanation, diagnosis and support of developmental disorders.","Converging evidence suggests that the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) might be important in schizophrenia. Atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs alter GSK-3 activity, as do drugs that induce psychosis. GSK-3 regulatory pathways are altered in schizophrenia, and many of the genes associated with schizophrenia directly or indirectly regulate GSK-3 activity. We propose a variant on the neurodevelopment and dopamine hypotheses of schizophrenia, whereby (i) an early dysfunction in GSK-3 regulation has neurodevelopmental consequences that predispose to disease and (ii) dysfunction in GSK-3 regulation in the adult brain alters dopamine signalling events, causing psychotic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. If, as we suggest, GSK-3 regulation is crucial to schizophrenia, the Wnt and insulin signalling pathways become targets for therapy.","The amplitude of alpha-frequency band (8-14 Hz) activity in the human electroencephalogram is suppressed by eye opening, visual stimuli and visual scanning, whereas it is enhanced during internal tasks, such as mental calculation and working memory. alpha-Frequency band oscillations have hence been thought to reflect idling or inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical areas. However, recent data on alpha-amplitude and, in particular, alpha-phase dynamics posit a direct and active role for alpha-frequency band rhythmicity in the mechanisms of attention and consciousness. We propose that simultaneous alpha-, beta- (14-30 Hz) and gamma- (30-70 Hz) frequency band oscillations are required for unified cognitive operations, and hypothesize that cross-frequency phase synchrony between alpha, beta and gamma oscillations coordinates the selection and maintenance of neuronal object representations during working memory, perception and consciousness.","Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a primary experimental model of memory formation in neuronal circuits. Because of the intellectual appeal and scientific fecundity of the field, it is perhaps unsurprising that the literature on LTP contains many complex and often contradictory findings. Recognition that LTP is not a unitary phenomenon and mechanisms can differ between brain regions has resolved some controversy. However, further categorization can be made of mechanistically discrete forms of LTP at the same set of synapses. LTP1, LTP2 and LTP3 have previously been defined according to differences in the longevity and general molecular mechanisms of LTP. This review aims to reinvigorate and extend this concept as a useful framework to disentangle the mechanisms of LTP.","AMPA receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses in the CNS and are crucial during neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling. AMPA receptors lacking GluR2 subunits are permeable to Ca(2+) and Zn(2+). Ca(2+) permeation through AMPA receptors is crucial in several forms of synaptic plasticity and cell death associated with neurological diseases and disorders. The subunit composition and Ca(2+) permeability of AMPA receptors are not static, but they are dynamically remodeled in a cell- and synapse-specific manner during development and in response to neuronal activity, sensory experience and neuronal insults. Exciting new research shows that these changes arise not only because of regulated expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, but also as a consequence of RNA editing, receptor trafficking and dendritic protein synthesis. This article reviews new insights into the role of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in neuronal function and survival.","Neuronal avalanches are spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity that occur spontaneously in superficial layers of the mammalian cortex under various experimental conditions. These patterns reflect fast propagation of local synchrony, display a rich spatiotemporal diversity and recur over several hours. The statistical organization of pattern sizes is invariant to the choice of spatial scale, demonstrating that the functional linking of cortical sites into avalanches occurs on all spatial scales with a fractal organization. These features suggest an underlying network of neuronal interactions that balances diverse representations with predictable recurrence, similar to what has been theorized for cell assembly formation. We propose that avalanches reflect the transient formation of cell assemblies in the cortex and discuss various models that provide mechanistic insights into the underlying dynamics, suggesting that they arise in a critical regime.","Chronic changes in the level of neuronal activity (over a period of days) trigger compensatory changes in synaptic function that seem to contribute to the homeostatic restoration of neuronal activity. Changes in both quantal amplitude and vesicle release contribute to homeostatic synaptic plasticity, but they are often considered as the same phenomenon. In this review, we propose a new approach to studying how neuronal activity is sensed and changes in synaptic function are expressed during synaptic compensation. Changes in quantal amplitude and vesicle release should be considered separately in an attempt to identify the sensors that trigger homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Although data are limited, current evidence suggests that the sensors triggering changes in the quantal amplitude and vesicle release exist at different locations. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that at least two different mechanisms underlie changes in quantal amplitude during homeostatic synaptic plasticity: changes in both the number of postsynaptic receptors and loading of synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitter. Finally, modulation of the probability of neurotransmitter release contributes to the changes in vesicle release associated with homeostatic synaptic plasticity. An improved understanding of where and how neuronal activity is sensed, in addition to the types of changes in synaptic function that are induced, will be needed both to design future experiments and to understand the consequences of synaptic compensation following injury to the nervous system.","Sumoylation is a post-translational modification that was originally thought to only target nuclear proteins. Evidence has emerged, however, that the role of sumoylation is much more diverse: three plasma membrane proteins belonging to different protein families (glucose transporters, K(+) channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors) have been shown to be sumoylated. In addition, sumoylation of transcription factors, such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), was found to regulate synapse formation. A major role of sumoylation in other systems is to modify protein-protein interactions, and because protein interactions are particularly elaborate in the nervous system and crucial for synapse formation and function, sumoylation could constitute a major regulatory mechanism in neurons. In this review, we evaluate the available data and discuss possible roles for sumoylation in the regulation of crucial neurobiological processes, such as neuronal development and synaptic transmission.","The neural mechanisms for the formation of declarative memory (memory for facts and events) are believed to be integrated from processes mediated by hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Traditionally, LTP has been designated as the main mediator of spatial memory storage in the hippocampus, whereas LTD has been assigned an auxiliary role in signal-to-noise regulation or in forgetting. It has recently become apparent, however, that LTD contributes directly to hippocampal information storage. In fact, LTD could dominate in the processing of precise spatial characteristics. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that LTP and LTD enable distinct and separate forms of information storage, which together facilitate the generation of a spatial cognitive map.","A complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying any kind of sensory, motor or cognitive task requires analysis from the systems to the cellular level. In olfaction, new behavioural evidence in rodents has provided temporal limits on neural processing times that correspond to less than 150ms--the timescale of a single sniff. Recent in vivo data from the olfactory bulb indicate that, within each sniff, odour representation is not only spatially organized, but also temporally structured by odour-specific patterns of onset latencies. Thus, we propose that the spatial representation of odour is not a static one, but rather evolves across a sniff, whereby for difficult discriminations of similar odours, it is necessary for the olfactory system to ""wait"" for later-activated components. Based on such evidence, we have devised a working model to assess further the relevance of such spatiotemporal processes in odour representation.","As an animal navigates its surroundings, the sounds reaching its two ears change in waveform similarity (interaural correlation) and in time of arrival (interaural time difference, ITD). Humans are exquisitely sensitive to these binaural cues, and it is generally agreed that this sensitivity involves coincidence detectors and internal delays that compensate for external acoustic delays (ITDs). Recent data show an unexpected relationship between the tuning of a neuron to frequency and to ITD, leading to several proposals for sources of internal delay and the neural coding of interaural temporal cues. We review the alternatives, and argue that an understanding of binaural mechanisms requires consideration of sensitivity not only to ITDs, but also to interaural correlation.","In recent years, dopamine has emerged as a key neurotransmitter that is crucially involved in incentive motivation and reinforcement learning. Dopamine release is evoked by rewards. The extensive divergence of outputs from a small number of dopaminergic neurons suggests a spatially nonselective action of dopamine, but it reinforces the specific actions that led to reward. How is this achieved? We propose that the selectivity of dopamine effects is achieved by the timing of dopamine release in relation to the activity of glutamatergic synapses, rather than by spatial localization of the dopamine signal to specific synaptic contacts. The synaptic mechanisms of these actions are unknown but reduced levels of dopamine, for example in Parkinson's disease, leads to a paucity of behavioural output, whereas its excess production has been associated with psychiatric problems. Clearly, there are therapeutic imperatives that require a better understanding of how dopamine functions at a synaptic level.","It is widely believed that the initiation of transmitter release in fast synapses is triggered by rapid Ca2+ entry and that the termination of release is governed by removal of Ca2+ from below the release sites. We argue that, although Ca2+ is essential for release, fast-entry kinetics render Ca2+ incapable of being the limiting factor for the initiation of release, and the relatively slow removal of Ca2+ cannot be the limiting factor for the termination of release. We suggest, and provide supporting evidence for, a novel general mechanism for control of fast transmitter release (in the range of milliseconds) from nerve terminals. According to this mechanism, two factors control release: Ca2+ and voltage-sensitive presynaptic inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Inhibitory autoreceptors are known to mediate slow feedback inhibition of transmitter release. We discuss the evidence showing that these receptors also control the initiation and termination of transmitter release by directly interacting with core proteins in the exocytotic machinery. This novel mechanism has important implications for understanding the regulation of transmitter release, synaptic plasticity and neuronal circuit properties.","Ejaculation, although mediated by a spinal ejaculation generator, is subject to descending supraspinal modulation from several brain regions. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) is involved in ejaculatory control, with its ejaculation-retarding effects likely to be attributable to activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors, both spinally and supraspinally. By contrast, stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors precipitates ejaculation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used for treatment of psychiatric disorders, can delay ejaculation in humans and are widely used 'off-label' for treatment of premature ejaculation. SSRIs require 1-2 weeks' chronic dosing to be effective, similar to their use for treatment of depression. However, a new short-acting SSRI is effective 'on demand' and might represent the first of a new generation of therapies targeted to premature ejaculation.","The mammalian olfactory system is unique in that sensory receptors synapse directly into the olfactory bulb of the forebrain without the thalamic relay that is common to all other sensory pathways. We argue that the olfactory bulb has an equivalent role to the thalamus, because the two regions have very similar structures and functions. Both the thalamus and the olfactory bulb are the final stage in sensory processing before reaching target cortical regions, at which there is a massive increase in neuron and synapse numbers. Thus, both structures act as a bottleneck that is a target for various modulatory inputs, and this arrangement enables efficient control of information flow before cortical processing occurs.","The importance of phosphorylation of key threonine, serine and tyrosine residues is a well known essential feature of many signal transduction pathways. A similar, highly conserved redox reaction involving cysteine thiols is now emerging as an important regulator of protein function. An example of this redox regulation is S-nitrosylation (the transfer of a nitric oxide group to a key protein thiol). Here, we review the chemical biology of an additional class of drugs, electrophiles (electron-deficient carbon centers), that react with key protein thiols, and provide insights into a broader class of reactions implicated in redox signaling. Interestingly, certain electrophilic compounds, including endogenous metabolites and natural products, seem to have neuroprotective effects, and this has resulted in the development of neuroprotective electrophilic drugs, including prostaglandin derivatives and hydroquinones, that exert their action through activating antioxidant-signaling cascades.","Sensory systems respond not only to stimuli from the environment but also to cues generated by an animal's own behaviour. This leads to problems of sensory processing because self-generated information can occur at the same time as external sensory information. However, in motor regions of the CNS corollary discharges are generated during behaviour. These signals are not used to generate movements directly but, instead, interact with the processing of self-generated sensory signals. Corollary discharges transiently modulate self-generated sensory responses and can prevent self-induced desensitization or help distinguish between self-generated and externally generated sensory information. Here, we review recent work that has identified corollary discharge pathways at different levels of the CNS in vertebrates and invertebrates.","Dopaminergic systems in the brain adapt in response to various stimuli from the internal and external world, but the mechanisms underlying this process are incompletely understood. Here, we review recent evidence that certain types of transcription factor of the nuclear receptor family, specifically Nur77 and retinoid X receptors, have important roles in adaptation and homeostatic regulation of dopaminergic systems. These findings call for a reassessment of our fundamental understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of dopamine-mediated transmission. Given that diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia are thought to involve adaptation of dopamine signalling, these findings might provide new insight into these pathologies and offer new avenues for drug development.","In recent times, the perception of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has shifted fundamentally. Such disorders are now thought of as serious diseases characterized by perturbations in the neuronal regulation of gastrointestinal function. The concept of visceral hypersensitivity, the characterization of neuronal networks in the 'brain-gut axis' and the identification of several novel 5-HT-mediated mechanisms have contributed to this shift. Here, we review how some of the more promising of these new mechanisms (e.g. those involving 5-HT transporters and the 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(7) and putative 5-HT(1p) receptors) might lead to a range of second-generation therapies that could revolutionize the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders, particularly IBS.","Compromise of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a potential basis for multiple physiological abnormalities and pathologies in the CNS. This could be because reduced protein turnover leads to bulk intracellular protein accumulation. However, conditions associated with compromised UPS function are also associated with impairments in protein synthesis, and impairment of UPS function is sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis. These data suggest that the toxicity of UPS inhibition need not depend on gross intracellular protein accumulation, and indicate the potential for crosstalk between the UPS and protein-synthesis pathways. In this review, we discuss evidence for interplay between the UPS and protein-synthesis machinery, and outline the implications of this crosstalk for physiological and pathological processes in the CNS.","GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, activates synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors, causing hyperpolarization of mature neurons. As in the embryonic nervous system, GABA depolarizes neural progenitors and immature neurons in the adult brain. Several recent studies have suggested that GABA has crucial roles in regulating different steps of adult neurogenesis, including proliferation of neural progenitors, migration and differentiation of neuroblasts, and synaptic integration of newborn neurons. Here, we review recent findings on how GABA regulates adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We also discuss an emerging view that GABA serves as a key mediator of neuronal activity in setting the tempo of adult neurogenesis.","Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug-taking behavior and high rates of relapse. According to recent theories, this addiction is due to drug-induced adaptations in the cellular mechanisms that underlie normal learning and memory. Such mechanisms involve signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). As we review here, evidence from rodent studies also implicates ERK in cocaine psychomotor sensitization, cocaine reward, consolidation and reconsolidation of memories for cocaine cues, and time-dependent increases in cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). The role of ERK in these behaviors involves long-term stable alterations in synaptic plasticity that result from repeated cocaine exposure, and also rapidly induced alterations in synaptic transmission events that acutely control cocaine-seeking behaviors. Pharmacological manipulations that decrease the extent to which cocaine and cocaine cues induce ERK activity might therefore be considered as potential treatments for cocaine addiction.","Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cellular proteins by protein kinases and phosphatases represent important mechanisms for controlling major biological events. In the nervous system, protein phosphatases are contained in highly dynamic complexes localized within specialized subcellular compartments and they ensure timely dephosphorylation of multiple neuronal phosphoproteins. This modulates the responsiveness of individual synapses to neural activity and controls synaptic plasticity. These enzymes in turn play a key role in many forms of learning and memory, and their dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits associated with aging and dementias or neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review key modes of regulation of neuronal protein serine/threonine phosphatases and their contribution to disorders of learning and memory.","It has recently been recognized that the entorhinal cortex has a crucial role in spatial representation and navigation. How the position of an animal is computed within the entorhinal circuitry remains to be determined, but the architectural organization of this brain area might provide some clues. Here, we review three organizational principles--recurrent connectivity, interlaminar connectivity and modular organization--and propose how each of them might contribute to the emergence and maintenance of positional representations in entorhinal neural networks.","Normal aging is often accompanied by impairments in forming new memories, and studies of aging rodents have revealed structural and functional changes to the hippocampus that might point to the mechanisms behind such memory loss. In this article, we synthesize recent neurobiological and neurophysiological findings into a model of the information-processing circuit of the aging hippocampus. The key point of the model is that small concurrent changes during aging strengthen the auto-associative network of the CA3 subregion at the cost of processing new information coming in from the entorhinal cortex. As a result of such reorganization in aged memory-impaired individuals, information that is already stored would become the dominant pattern of the hippocampus to the detriment of the ability to encode new information.","The special conformation of the developing nervous system, in which progenitor zones are largely confined to the lumen of the neural tube, places neuronal migration as one of the most fundamental processes in brain development. Previous studies have shown that different neuronal types adopt distinct morphological modes of migration in the developing brain, indicating that neuronal migration might be a diverse process. Here, we review recent data on the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal migration that suggest that similar signaling principles are responsible for the frequently variable morphology of different types of migrating neuron. According to this idea, the same basic molecular mechanisms found in other cell types, such as fibroblasts, might have been adapted to the special morphological needs of migrating neurons in different regions of the developing brain.","Lipoprotein receptors have important roles in pathological processes that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, they were believed to act mainly by modulating the neuronal metabolism of cholesterol and apolipoprotein E, major risk factors for spontaneous AD. However, recent findings point towards an unexpected new function for lipoprotein receptors in regulation of intracellular transport and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to give amyloid-beta peptide, the principal component of senile plaques. Here, we will discuss how lipoprotein receptors might modulate distinct steps in neuronal trafficking of APP, and how an intricate balance between opposing receptor activities might be a crucial determinant of APP processing, and of onset and progression of neurodegeneration.","In a screen for homeobox transcription factors expressed in the embryonic ventral midbrain, Andersson et al. recently identified Lmx1a and Msx1. Using in ovo electroporation in chick embryos, they showed that these factors are crucial for initiating the differentiation of neuroepithelial progenitor neurons into mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons. Lmx1a also initiated a developmental program that drove an mdDA phenotype in mouse embryonic stem cells. This indicates that these factors can be exploited in cell-replacement strategies for treatment of Parkinson's disease.","The laboratory mouse has emerged as a primary model organism for studying axon regeneration after experimental spinal cord injury, owing to its genetic amenability. Mutant mouse models are contributing significantly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of axon regeneration failure in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), in particular regarding the role of axon-growth inhibitors. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding axon regeneration failure that have been made using genetically modified mice, focusing on the inhibitory influences in the CNS, and we illustrate the advantages of using the mouse as a surrogate organism to study axon regeneration and spinal cord repair.","The adenosine A2A receptor has emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target in the pursuit of improved therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), based in part on its unique CNS distribution. It is highly enriched in striatopallidal neurons and can form functional heteromeric complexes with other G-protein-coupled receptors, including dopamine D2, metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 and adenosine A1 receptors. Blockade of the adenosine A2A receptor in striatopallidal neurons reduces postsynaptic effects of dopamine depletion, and in turn lessens the motor deficits of PD. A2A antagonists might partially improve not only the symptoms of PD but also its course, by slowing the underlying neurodegeneration and reducing the maladaptive neuroplasticity that complicates standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Thus, we review here a prime example of translational neuroscience, through which antagonism of A2A receptors has now entered the arena of clinical trials with realistic prospects for advancing PD therapeutics.","Diets rich in vegetables and fruits are associated with reduced risk of several major diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Although some beneficial phytochemicals might function solely as antioxidants, it is becoming clear that many of the beneficial chemicals in vegetables and fruits evolved as toxins (to dissuade insects and other predators) that, at subtoxic doses, activate adaptive cellular stress-response pathways in a variety of cells including neurons. Examples of such 'preconditioning' or 'neurohormesis' pathways include those involving cell-survival signaling kinases, the transcription factors NRF2 and CREB, and histone deacetylases of the sirtuin family. In these ways, neurohormetic phytochemicals such as resveratrol, sulforaphanes and curcumin might protect neurons against injury and disease by stimulating the production of antioxidant enzymes, neurotrophic factors, protein chaperones and other proteins that help cells to withstand stress. Thus, as we discuss in this review, highly conserved longevity and survival pathways in neurons are the targets of many phytochemicals.","Computer simulations are being used increasingly to gain an understanding of the complex interactions between the neuronal, sensory, muscular and mechanical components of locomotor systems. Recent neuro-mechanical simulations of walking in humans, cats and insects, and of swimming in lampreys, have provided new information on the functional role of specific groups of sensory receptors in regulating locomotion. As we discuss in this review, these studies also make it clear that a full understanding of the neural and mechanical mechanisms that underlie locomotion can be achieved only by using simulations in parallel with physiological investigations. The widespread implementation of this approach would be enhanced by the development of freely available and easy-to-use software tools.","Neuroplasticity induced in the nucleus accumbens by repeated psychostimulant administration is thought to underlie the vulnerability to relapse in addicts. Electrophysiological research presents a contradictory portrait of psychostimulant-induced neuroplasticity, reflecting both increases and decreases in excitatory transmission. Drug-induced adaptations of ionic conductances decrease the intrinsic excitability of individual nucleus accumbens spiny neurons but, in the context of the circuitry in which these neurons are embedded, such reduced intrinsic excitability increases the salience of excitatory drive that is elicited by drug-associated stimuli. Thus, we propose that reduced basal excitability, combined with enhanced excitatory drive by drug-associated stimuli, contributes to the two cardinal features of addiction: reduced responding to natural reward and enduring vulnerability to relapse.","Calcium influx into presynaptic nerve terminals via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is an essential step in neurotransmitter release. The predominant Ca2+ channel species in synaptic nerve terminals are P/Q-type and N-type channels, with their relative levels of expression varying across the nervous system. The different distributions of these two channel subtypes are reflected in their distinct physiological and pathological roles, yet their activity is regulated by common mechanisms and both function as part of larger signaling complexes that enable their precise regulation and subcellular targeting. Here, we provide a broad overview of molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate Ca2+ channels, and how these cellular signaling pathways are integrated at the level of the channel protein.","The olfactory and immune systems must perform optimally in the task of recognizing thousands of molecules to ensure survival. A particularly intriguing link between these systems is that animals can smell differences in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a cluster of highly polymorphic genes found on human chromosome 6 and mouse chromosome 17. Two different sets of compounds found in urine have been postulated to convey information on MHC haplotype: volatile compounds (odortypes) and MHC peptides. Here we argue for complementary roles for these chemosignals.","In vitro experiments indicate that intrinsic neuronal excitability, as evidenced by changes in the post-burst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and spike-frequency accommodation, is altered during learning and normal aging in the brain. Here we review these studies, highlighting two consistent findings: (i) that AHP and accommodation are reduced in pyramidal neurons from animals that have learned a task; and (ii) that AHP and accommodation are enhanced in pyramidal neurons from aging subjects, a cellular change that might contribute to age-related learning impairments. Findings from in vivo single-neuron recording studies complement the in vitro data. From these consistently reproduced findings, we propose that the intrinsic AHP level might determine the degree of synaptic plasticity and learning. Furthermore, it seems that reductions in the AHP must occur before learning if young and aging subjects are to learn a task successfully.","One of the most distinguishing features of the adult human brain is the complexity and diversity of its cortical astrocytes. Human protoplasmic astrocytes manifest a threefold larger diameter and have tenfold more primary processes than those of rodents. In all mammals, protoplasmic astrocytes are organized into spatially non-overlapping domains that encompass both neurons and vasculature. Yet unique to humans and primates are additional populations of layer 1 interlaminar astrocytes that extend long (millimeter) fibers, and layer 5-6 polarized astrocytes that also project distinctive long processes. We propose that human cortical evolution has been accompanied by increasing complexity in the form and function of astrocytes, which reflects an expansion of their functional roles in synaptic modulation and cortical circuitry.","Recent results are changing the way we think about cell-fate decision mechanisms in the retina. For a long time it was accepted that lineage was not important in retinal cellular determination but, as we review here, new data show that lineage programmes might be at the heart of this process. These programmes are intrinsic, but they are also plastic and are influenced by extrinsic signals.","The orexins (or hypocretins) are neuropeptide transmitters made exclusively in hypothalamic neurons that have extensive CNS projections. Previous studies reported that this system is most strongly associated with feeding, arousal and the maintenance of waking. We review here recent studies that reveal a novel and important role for the orexin/hypocretin neuronal system in reward processing and addiction. We propose that the current evidence indicates a dichotomy in orexin function, such that orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus regulate reward processing for both food and abused drugs, whereas those in the perifornical and dorsomedial hypothalamus regulate arousal and response to stress. Evidence also indicates roles for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons and ventral tegmental orexin receptors in reward-based learning and memory.","Extracellular acid can have important effects on neuron function. In central and peripheral neurons, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have emerged as key receptors for extracellular protons, and recent studies suggest diverse roles for these channels in the pathophysiology of pain, ischemic stroke and psychiatric disease. ASICs have also been implicated in mechanosensation in the peripheral nervous system and in neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Here, we briefly review advances in our understanding of ASICs, their potential contributions to disease, and the possibility for their therapeutic modification.","Ampakines are the first peripherally administered drugs that increase excitatory monosynaptic responses in the brain. Because of this effect, the compounds improve communication in complex networks, potently facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP) and induce the expression of neurotrophic factors. Ampakines are effective in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders and have produced positive results in a small number of human studies. Neurobiological considerations and modeling studies suggest that the drugs, in addition to their effects on disturbed behavior, will alter the encoding and organization of information in normal brains. Results from physiological and behavioral studies accord with this prediction. Building on these findings, this article considers how the threefold effects of ampakines will modify, and enhance, cognition.", ,"Classical knowledge distinguishes between inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the brain. Either the immune system acts on the CNS and initiates a damage cascade, as in autoimmune (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and infectious conditions, or the primary insult is not inflammation but ischemia or degeneration, as in stroke and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. However, as we review here, recent advances have blurred this distinction. On the one hand, the classical inflammatory diseases of the brain also exhibit profound and early neurodegenerative features - remarkably, it has been known for more than a century that neuronal damage is a key feature of multiple sclerosis pathology, yet this was neglected until very recently. On the other hand, immune mechanisms might set the pace of progressive CNS damage in primary neurodegeneration. Despite differing initial events, increasing evidence indicates that even in clinically heterogeneous diseases, there might be common immunological pathways that result in neurotoxicity and reveal targets for more efficient therapies.","To understand cognition, it is important to understand how a learned response becomes a long-lasting memory. This process of memory consolidation has been modeled extensively using one-trial avoidance learning, in which animals (or humans) establish a conditioned response by learning to avoid danger in just one trial. This relies on molecular events in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that resemble those involved in CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP), and it also requires equivalent events to occur with different timings in the basolateral amygdala and the entorhinal, parietal and cingulate cortex. Many of these steps are modulated by monoaminergic pathways related to the perception of and reaction to emotion, which at least partly explains why strong and resistant consolidation is typical of emotion-laden memories. Thus memory consolidation involves a complex network of brain systems and serial and parallel molecular events, even for a task as deceptively simple as one-trial avoidance. We propose that these molecular events might also be involved in many other memory types in animals and humans.","Microglia are seen as the sentries in the CNS who provide a first line of defense whenever there is injury or disease. Microglia and related perivascular macrophages perform various functions, ranging from immunological surveillance to neuroprotection. Recent work in the aged human brain has provided morphological evidence of structural deterioration of microglia, and work in rodents suggests that microglia are subject to replicative senescence (loss of mitotic ability after repeated rounds of replication). Together these observations raise the possibility that old age, and perhaps other factors (genetic and epigenetic) adversely affect viability and self-renewal capacity of microglia, resulting in the generation of senescent and/or dysfunctional cells. Such attrition of the brain's immune system could contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease by diminishing glial neuroprotection.","Neuroethics, a recently modernized field at the intersection of bioethics and neuroscience, is founded on centuries of discussion of the ethical issues associated with mind and behavior. Broadly defined, neuroethics is concerned with ethical, legal and social policy implications of neuroscience, and with aspects of neuroscience research itself. Advances in neuroscience increasingly challenge long-held views of the self and the individual's relationship to society. Neuroscience also has led to innovations in clinical medicine that have not only therapeutic but also non-therapeutic dimensions that extend well beyond previously charted boundaries. The exponential increase in cross-disciplinary research, the commercialization of cognitive neuroscience, the impetus for training in ethics, and the increased attention being paid to public understanding of science all illuminate the important role of neuroethics in neuroscience.","Autophagy, a lysosomal pathway for degrading organelles and long-lived proteins, is becoming recognized as a key adaptive response that can preclude death in stressed or diseased cells. However, during development strong induction of autophagy in specific cell populations mediates a type of programmed cell death that has distinctive 'autophagic' morphology and a requirement for autophagy activity. The recent identification of autophagosomes in neurons in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders has, therefore, sparked controversy about whether these structures are contributing to neuronal cell death or protecting against it. Emerging evidence supports the view that induction of autophagy is a neuroprotective response and that inadequate or defective autophagy, rather than excessive autophagy, promotes neuronal cell death in most of these disorders. In this review, we consider possible mechanisms underlying autophagy-associated cell death and their relationship to pathways mediating apoptosis and necrosis.","Since the original demonstration that electrical activity generated by ensembles of cortical neurons can be employed directly to control a robotic manipulator, research on brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has experienced an impressive growth. Today BMIs designed for both experimental and clinical studies can translate raw neuronal signals into motor commands that reproduce arm reaching and hand grasping movements in artificial actuators. Clearly, these developments hold promise for the restoration of limb mobility in paralyzed subjects. However, as we review here, before this goal can be reached several bottlenecks have to be passed. These include designing a fully implantable biocompatible recording device, further developing real-time computational algorithms, introducing a method for providing the brain with sensory feedback from the actuators, and designing and building artificial prostheses that can be controlled directly by brain-derived signals. By reaching these milestones, future BMIs will be able to drive and control revolutionary prostheses that feel and act like the human arm.","The neural mechanisms of stereoscopic 3D shape perception have only recently been investigated. Here we review the two cortical regions in which these mechanisms have been studied so far in macaques: a small subpart of inferotemporal cortex called TEs, and the caudal intraparietal (CIP) region. Neurons in TEs respond selectively to the orientation and curvature in depth of stereoscopic surfaces and this region provides a detailed 3D shape description of surface boundaries and surface content. This description is evoked only by binocular stimuli in which subjects see depth and it does not vary if depth is specified by different cues. Neurons in CIP are a selective for orientation in depth of surfaces and elongated objects, and their responses are also unaffected by changes in depth cues. Thus, stereoscopic 3D shape is processed in both the dorsal, occipito-parietal and the ventral, occipito-temporal streams.","Over the past few years, it has become clear that oscillatory dynamics of cortical networks are closely involved in sensory coding, attention, memory and sleep. Although most experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the neocortex, we believe that progress in understanding cortical oscillations can be advanced by also considering the olfactory system--which shares many basic properties with the neocortex and shows similar oscillatory patterns. Besides offering the advantage of a greater experimental tractability, the olfactory cortex might prove to be instrumental in uncovering general functional principles of neocortical oscillations, by virtue of the potentially important role of olfaction during neocortical evolution. In this article, we illustrate how such an evolution-based comparative approach can provide novel insights into neocortical slow-wave sleep oscillations and their relationship to respiration.","Intra-individual variability reflects a transient, within-person change in behavioral performance. It is a common component of aging-related cognitive decline and the behavioral changes associated with neurodegenerative and other brain-related disorders such as traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. Behavioral changes within an individual can reflect alterations at a systems or a cellular level in the brain, and monitoring intra-individual variability can therefore provide a warning of underlying pathology. Despite frequent reports of intra-individual variability, there is little synthesis, and no direct examination of the neural underpinnings. Here, we integrate seminal findings from cognitive research across lifespans of individuals, and also neuropsychological and neurobiological findings, to identify key questions and some potential answers, and to set challenges for fostering future research into intra-individual variability.","Innate behaviors offer a unique opportunity to use genetic analysis to dissect and characterize the neural substrates of complex behavioral programs. Courtship in Drosophila involves a complex series of stereotyped behaviors that include numerous exchanges of multimodal sensory information over time. As we will discuss in this review, recent work has demonstrated that male-specific expression of Fruitless transcription factors (Fru(M) proteins) is necessary and sufficient to confer the potential for male courtship behaviors. Fru(M) factors program neurons of the male central and peripheral nervous systems whose function is dedicated to sexual behaviors. This circuitry seems to integrate sensory information to define behavioral states and regulate conserved neural elements for sex-specific behavioral output. The principles that govern the circuitry specified by Fru(M) expression might also operate in subcortical networks that govern innate behaviors in mammals.","Striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has recently been identified as a crucial player in the regulation of synaptic function. It is restricted to neurons within the CNS and acts by downregulating the activity of MAP kinases, the tyrosine kinase Fyn and NMDA receptors. By modulating these substrates, STEP acts on several parallel pathways that impact upon the progression of synaptic plasticity. Here, we review recent advances that demonstrate the importance of STEP in normal cognitive function, and its possible involvement in cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.","Numerous degenerative diseases are characterized by the aberrant polymerization and accumulation of specific proteins. These proteopathies include neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and the prion diseases, in addition to diverse systemic disorders, particularly the amyloidoses. The prion diseases have been shown to be transmissible by an alternative conformation of the normal cellular prion protein. Other proteopathies have been thought to be non-transmissible, but there is growing evidence that some systemic and cerebral amyloidoses can be induced by exposure of susceptible hosts to cognate molecular templates. As we review here, the mechanistic similarities among these diseases provide unprecedented opportunities for elucidating the induction of protein misfolding and assembly in vivo, and for developing an integrated therapeutic approach to degenerative proteopathies.","Alpha Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alphaCaMKII), the major synaptic protein in the forebrain, can switch into a state of autonomous activity upon autophosphorylation. It has been proposed that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation mediates long-term memory (LTM) storage. However, recent evidence shows that synaptic stimulation and behavioural training only transiently increase the autonomous alphaCaMKII activity, implicating alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation in LTM formation rather than storage. Consistent with this, mutant mice deficient in alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation can store LTM after a massed training protocol, but cannot form LTM after a single trial. Here, we review evidence that the role of alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation is in fact to enable LTM formation after a single training trial, possibly by regulating LTM consolidation-specific transcription.","Neurons and glia talk to each other at synapses. Glia sense the level of synaptic activity and consequently regulate its efficacy via the release of neuromodulators. One such glia-derived modulator is D-serine, an amino acid that serves as an endogenous ligand for the strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site of NMDA glutamate receptors. Here, we provide an overview of recent findings on the mechanisms of its synthesis, release and clearance at synapses, with an emphasis on the dichotomy of behaviour of this novel messenger in the brain. The discovery of the good and ugly faces of this gliotransmitter is an important issue of modern neuroscience that has repercussions for the treatment of brain disorders.","Speech processing in adults relies on precise and specialized networks, located primarily in the left hemisphere. Behavioral studies in infants indicate that a considerable amount of language learning already takes place in the first year of life in the domains of phonology, prosody and word segmentation. Thanks to neuroimaging, we can move beyond behavioral methods and examine how the infant brain processes verbal stimuli before learning. These studies reveal a structural and functional organization close to what is described in adults and suggest a strong bias for speech processing in these regions that might guide infants as they discover the properties of their native language, although no evidence can be provided as yet for speech specificity of such networks. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","Our understanding of human disorders that affect higher cognitive functions has greatly advanced in recent decades, and over 20 genes associated with non-syndromic mental retardation have been identified during the past 15 years. However, proteins encoded by ""cognition genes"" have such diverse neurodevelopmental functions that delineating specific pathogenetic pathways still poses a tremendous challenge. In this review, we summarize genetic, epigenetic and environmental contributions to neurodevelopmental alterations that either cause or confer vulnerability to autism, a disease primarily affecting social cognition. Taken together, these results begin to provide a unifying view of complex pathogenetic pathways that are likely to lead to autism spectrum disorders through altered neurite morphology, synaptogenesis and cell migration. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","A number of different RNA and DNA viruses can invade the brain and cause neurological dysfunction. These range from the tiny polio picornavirus, which has only 7kb of RNA genetic code that preferentially infects motor neurons, to the relatively large cytomegalovirus, which has >100 genes in its 235kb DNA genome and causes various neurological problems in the developing brain but is comparatively harmless to adults. This brief overview of some aspects of neurovirology addresses the complex problems that underlie an appreciation of the contribution of viral infections to brain disease.

Research has focused on whether or not sensorimotor deficits, specifically auditory spectrotemporal processing deficits, cause phonological deficit, leading to language and reading impairments. New trends aimed at resolving this question include prospective longitudinal studies of genetically at-risk infants, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, and studies aimed at evaluating the effects of auditory training (including musical training) on brain organization for language. Better understanding of the origins of developmental LLI will advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in language development and lead to more effective educational and intervention strategies.

Based on recent brain-imaging results, our hypothesis is that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are highly implicated in ASD. STS abnormalities are characterized by decreased gray matter concentration, rest hypoperfusion and abnormal activation during social tasks. STS anatomical and functional anomalies occurring during early brain development could constitute the first step in the cascade of neural dysfunction underlying ASD. We will focus this review on the STS, which has been highly implicated in social cognition. We will review recent data on the contribution of the STS to normal social cognition and review brain-imaging data implicating this area in ASD.

Some of these are behaviourally relevant, whereas others occur during seizures and other pathological conditions. This raises the question of how physiological oscillations differ from pathogenic ones. In this review, this issue is discussed from a developmental standpoint. Indeed, both epileptic and physiological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) appear progressively during maturation, and it is therefore possible to determine how this program corresponds to maturation of the neuronal populations that generate these oscillations. We review here important differences in the development of neuronal populations that might contribute to their different oscillatory properties. In particular, at an early stage, the density of glutamatergic synapses is too low for physiological HFOs but an additional drive can be provided by excitatory GABA, triggering epileptic HFOs and the cascades involved in long-lasting epileptogenic transformations. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","Epilepsies, once regarded as due to demoniacal possession, can have both genetic and acquired causes, with interaction of these factors in many cases. To date, nearly all the genes discovered to be involved in human epilepsies encode subunits of ion channels, both voltage-gated and ligand-gated. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and infective lesions. Thus, in terms of exploring the neurobiology of ""nature and nurture"" in disease, the epilepsies are an excellent paradigm. Here, we review the evidence and discuss the possibility that ion channels are a common biological substrate for both genetic and acquired epilepsies. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","Cognitive memory involves long-term memories for facts (semantic memory) and personal experiences (episodic memory) that can be brought to mind. There is consensus that the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures are crucial for adult cognitive memory, but much less is known about their contribution to memory during infancy and childhood. We argue that the MTL is involved in memory from early in life, supporting recognition memory within the first postnatal months and recall memory within the first year. We propose that normal development involves a sequence in which a form of semantic-like memory emerges first, whereas the characteristics of episodic memory develop only later with progressive development of the hippocampus. Early bilateral injury to the hippocampus disrupts this normal pattern such that memory skills cannot develop beyond the stage of semantic memories. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","The genetic basis is now known for several disorders of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. Identification of the cellular processes mediated by the implicated genes is revealing crucial stages of neuronal migration and has the potential to reveal common cellular causes of neuronal migration disorders. We hypothesize that a newly recognized morphological stage of neuronal migration, the multipolar stage, is vulnerable and is disrupted in several disorders of neocortical development. The multipolar stage occurs as bipolar progenitor cells become radially migrating neurons. Several studies using in utero electroporation and RNAi have revealed that transition out of the multipolar stage depends on the function of filamin A, LIS1 and DCX. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins in humans cause distinct neuronal migration disorders, including periventricular nodular heterotopia, subcortical band heterotopia and lissencephaly. The multipolar stage therefore seems to be a critical point of migration control and a vulnerable target for disruption of neocortical development. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).","During prenatal and early postnatal development, the cerebral cortex exhibits synchronized oscillatory network activity that is believed to be essential for the generation of neuronal cortical circuits. The nature and functional role of these early activity patterns are of central interest in neuroscience. Much of the research is performed in rodents and in vitro, but how closely do these model systems relate to the human fetal brain? In this review, we compare observations in humans with in vivo and in vitro rodent data, focusing on particular oscillatory activity patterns that share many common features: delta brushes, spindle bursts and spindle-like oscillations. There is considerable evidence that the basic functional properties of immature cortical networks are conserved through mammalian evolution, making the neonatal rodent an excellent model for studying early cortical activity and associated plasticity during the developmental period corresponding to the human fetal stage. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue ""Nature and nurture in brain development and neurological disorders"", based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com/).",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2006.05.005 PMID: 16716413  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Neural circuits within the vertebrate brain are composed of highly diverse cell types. The exact extent of this diversity is a matter of continuing debate. For example, do cortical interneurons comprise a few, dozens or >100 distinct cell types? Recently, several groups have used microarrays to measure genome-wide gene expression profiles for specific neuronal cell types. These methods can offer an objective basis for neuronal classification. In this review, we argue that this approach should now be carried out more broadly and that it should be coupled to large-scale efforts to generate mouse driver lines in which tools for genetic manipulation, such as the Cre recombinase, are expressed in identified cell types within the brain. This would enable neuroscientists to begin to investigate more systematically the roles of specific genes in establishing particular cellular phenotypes, and also the roles of particular cell types within brain circuits.

The classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane and eyelid response is a widely used experimental model for studying the neural bases of motor learning in mammals. Nevertheless, information is still needed on the functional aspects, taking place simultaneously in different cerebral structures, that underlie acquisition, extinction and recall of new motor and cognitive abilities. Here, we review recent data on the neural activity generated in selected brain sites (facial motor nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei and the hippocampus) in simultaneity with the process of learning. The use of modern technologies for the proper recording of eyelid movements, for the identification of the recorded units, and for the activation of selective synaptic processes during the learning situation enables a precise redefinition of the role played by these neural structures in such associative learning. This review is part of the TINS special issue on The Neural Substrates of Cognition.","Feedback projections are an integral part of the mammalian visual system. Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus. This review is part of the TINS special issue on The Neural Substrates of Cognition.","Although once regarded as a simple sensory relay on the way to the cortex, it is increasingly apparent that the thalamus has a role in the ongoing moment-by-moment processing of sensory input and in cognition. This involves extensive corticofugal feedback connections and the interplay of these with the local thalamic circuitry and the other converging inputs. Here, using the feline visual system as the primary model, some of the latest developments in this field are reviewed and placed in the perspective of an integrated view of system function. Cortical feedback mediated by ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and effects mediated by the neuromodulator nitric oxide, all have a role in integrating the thalamic mechanism into the cortical circuit. The essential point is that the perspective of higher-level sensory mechanisms shifts and modulates the thalamic circuitry in ways that optimize abstraction of a meaningful representation of the external world. This review is part of the TINS special issue on The Neural Substrates of Cognition.","Although most studies of visual attention have examined the effects of shifting attention between different locations in the visual field, attention can also be directed to particular visual features, such as a color, orientation or a direction of motion. Single-unit studies have shown that attention to a feature modulates neuronal signals in a range of areas in monkey visual cortex. The location-independent property of feature-based attention makes it particularly well suited to modify selectively the neural representations of stimuli or parts within complex visual scenes that match the currently attended feature. This review is part of the TINS special issue on The Neural Substrates of Cognition.","The cerebral cortex is subdivided into discrete functional areas that are defined by specific properties, including the presence of different cell types, molecular expression patterns, microcircuitry and long-range connectivity. These properties enable different areas of cortex to carry out distinct functions. Emerging data argue that the particular structure and identity of cortical areas derives not only from specific inputs but also from unique processing networks. The aim of this review is to summarize current information on the interplay of intrinsic molecular cues with activity patterns that are driven by sensory experience and shape cortical networks as they develop, emphasizing synaptic connections in networks that process vision. This review is part of the TINS special issue on The Neural Substrates of Cognition.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been linked recently with autosomal-dominant parkinsonism that is clinically indistinguishable from typical, idiopathic, late-onset PD. Thus, the protein LRRK2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of PD. LRRK2 is extraordinarily large and complex, with multiple enzymatic and protein-interaction domains, each of which is targeted by pathogenic mutations in familial PD. This review places the PD-associated mutations of LRRK2 in a structural and functional framework, with the ultimate aim of deciphering the molecular basis of LRRK2-associated pathogenesis. This, in turn, should advance our understanding and treatment of familial and idiopathic PD.","Recent data have provided important clues about the molecular mechanisms underlying certain retinal degenerative diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Photoreceptor cell degeneration is a feature common to these diseases, and the death of these cells in many instances seems to involve the closely associated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Under normal circumstances, both cell types are subject to potentially damaging stimuli (e.g. sunlight and high oxygen tension). However, the mechanism or mechanisms by which homeostasis is maintained in this part of the eye, which is crucial for sight, are an unsolved riddle. The omega-3 fatty acid family member docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is enriched in these cells, is the precursor of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1). NPD1 inhibits oxidative-stress-mediated proinflammatory gene induction and apoptosis, and consequently promotes RPE cell survival. This enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective signaling in the RPE presents an opportunity for the development of therapies for retinal degenerative diseases.","Mounting evidence indicates that, besides their well-known hormonal mode of action at the genetic level, estrogens such as 17beta-estradiol also influence brain function by direct effects on neuronal membranes. Experimentally induced rapid changes in estradiol bioavailability in the brain have been shown to alter the expression of male sexual behavior significantly within minutes--probably too quickly to be accounted for by conventional genetic mechanisms. In parallel, recent studies indicate that aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol in the brain, is expressed in presynaptic terminals and modulated within minutes by Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation. In this article, we develop the hypothesis that brain estrogens display many, if not all, functional characteristics of neuromodulators or even neurotransmitters.","Currently available antibodies to the P2X(7) receptor are unreliable determinants of neuronal P2X(7) immunoreactivity, owing to staining of a ""P2X(7)-like"" protein that is not eliminated by legitimate P2X(7) gene-knockout approaches. Despite this, compelling electrophysiological and pharmacological data strongly support a role for P2X(7) receptors in neuronal function and injury. A major priority for the field now is to identify the neuronal ""P2X(7)-like"" protein and develop effective antibodies selective for neuronal P2X(7) immunoreactivity. Until this occurs, we are dependent on rigorous application of multiple pharmacological criteria for attribution of neuronal function to P2X(7) receptors in non-human tissues, including greater activity in response to BzATP than to ATP, sensitivity to blockade by nanomolar concentrations of Brilliant Blue-G, irreversible antagonism by periodate-oxidized ATP, and lack of inhibition by suramin.","Cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) within neuritic plaques is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease. It is now generally believed that the development of this pathology is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. As such, inhibiting Abeta deposition or removing Abeta deposits once they are formed represent therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is derived from a precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and APP binds to the X11 family of adaptor proteins. Studies from several laboratories have now shown that X11alpha and X11beta (the two neuronal X11s) inhibit APP processing and Abeta production. Exactly how this is achieved is not yet known but recent studies in which other X11 binding partners have been identified are beginning to reveal potential mechanisms.","The amygdala is a heterogeneous structure that has been implicated in a wide variety of functions, most notably in fear conditioning. From this research, an influential serial model of amygdala processes has emerged in which aversive learning is mediated by the amygdala basolateral nucleus whereas performance, in this case of various defensive reflexes, is mediated by the central nucleus. By contrast, recent evidence from appetitive conditioning studies suggests that the basolateral and central nuclei operate in parallel to mediate distinct incentive processes: the basolateral nucleus encodes emotional events with reference to their particular sensory-specific features, whereas the central nucleus encodes their more general motivational or affective significance. Given that there is little if any direct behavioral evidence for the serial model, we suggest that more attention should be given to the claims of the parallel view.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRIa) is an increasingly popular method that aims to provide insight into the functional properties of subpopulations of neurons within an imaging voxel. The technique relies on the assumption that neural adaptation reduces activity when two successive stimuli activate the same subpopulation but not when they stimulate different subpopulations. Here, we assess the validity of fMRIa by comparing single-cell recordings with functional imaging of orientation, motion and face processing. We find that fMRIa provides novel insight into neural representations in the human brain. However, network responses in general and adaptation in particular are more complex than is often assumed, and an unequivocal interpretation of fMRIa results can be achieved only with great care.","Significant developments have occurred in our understanding of the mammalian genome thanks to informatics, expression profiling and sequencing of the human and rodent genomes. However, although these facets of genomic analysis are being addressed, analysis of in vivo gene function remains a formidable task. Evaluation of the phenotype of mutants provides powerful access to gene function, and this approach is particularly relevant to the nervous system and behavior. Here, we discuss the complementary mouse genetic approaches of gene-driven, targeted mutagenesis and phenotype-driven, chemical mutagenesis. We highlight an NIH-supported large-scale effort to use phenotype-driven mutagenesis screens to identify mouse mutants with neural and behavioral alterations. Such single-gene mutations can then be used for gene identification using positional candidate gene-cloning methods.","Patients with occupational hand dystonias have task-specific involuntary co-contraction and overflow of activity to inappropriate muscles. This interferes with highly skilled movements such as handwriting (writer's cramp) or playing a musical instrument (musician's cramp). Transcranial stimulation methods that probe mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the motor cortex show an abnormal modifiability of sensorimotor circuits in patients with writer's cramp, probably because homeostatic control of the range of modification is deficient. We argue that during skilled motor practice, this leads to an excessive tendency to form associations between sensory inputs and motor outputs (abnormal potentiation) and to a failure to weaken already existing associations (deficient depotentiation). Deficient homeostatic control might be an important mechanism that triggers maladaptive reorganization and produces symptoms of occupational hand dystonias.","The ACh hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a combinatorial series of proteins with variant N and C termini generated from alternate promoter usage and 3' alternative splicing. Neuronal AChE variants show indistinguishable enzymatic activity yet differ in their expression, multimeric assembly and membrane-association patterns. Differentially induced under stress, they show distinct non-hydrolytic properties and interact with different protein partners. Recent findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of AChE pre-mRNA is a neuroprotection strategy but might involve long-term damage. Specifically, variant-specific causal involvement of AChE in the progression of both neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and neuromuscular syndromes (e.g. myasthenia gravis) raises the possibility that future therapeutic drugs might target specific AChE variant(s) or the corresponding RNA transcripts.","It is well established that some excitatory nerve terminals have high concentrations of Zn(2+) in their synaptic vesicles. For some time, it has been believed that synaptic Zn(2+) is released during neurotransmission and acts as a neuromodulator. Fluorescent Zn(2+) indicators that do not penetrate membranes offer the prospect of rendering the release of Zn(2+) visible. Here, I take a critical look at fluorimetric imaging experiments devised to determine whether Zn(2+) is released and show that they are particularly susceptible to artifacts. Moreover, I will argue that recent experiments suggest that, rather than being released, Zn(2+) is presented to the extracellular space firmly coordinated to presynaptic macromolecules.","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of mental retardation that results from the loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). A recent report demonstrated alterations in the structure and plasticity of synapses on cerebellar Purkinje cells in Fmr1 knockout mice, which are a model of FXS. These synaptic alterations are associated with deficits in the cerebellar learning both in the mice and humans with FXS. This work forges an important link between the FMR1 gene, altered synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and mental retardation.","Neuropathic pain and phantom phenomena occur commonly after spinal cord injury (SCI) but their molecular basis is not yet fully understood. Recent findings demonstrate abnormal expression of the Nav1.3 Na(+) channel within second-order spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and third-order thalamic neurons along the pain pathway after SCI, and suggest that this change makes these neurons hyperexcitable so that they act as pain amplifiers and generators. Delineation of molecular changes that contribute to hyperexcitability of pain-signaling neurons might lead to identification of molecular targets that will be useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain after SCI and related nervous system injuries.","How are appropriate connections between neurons sorted from the overwhelming surplus of potential, yet inappropriate, connections? Despite the apparently improbable nature of the process, brains wire themselves with a high degree of reproducibility that has been conserved across evolutionary history. Here, we outline a viable cell-biological model for generating synaptic specificity that features selection of nascent synapses based on adhesion and recognition. This process uses the highly dynamic and stochastic nature of intracellular trafficking to generate reproducible patterns of synaptic connectivity.","Recent studies have shown that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the common neurobiological mechanism underlying drug addiction. This system participates in the primary rewarding effects of cannabinoids, nicotine, alcohol and opioids, through the release of endocannabinoids in the ventral tegmental area. Endocannabinoids are also involved in the motivation to seek drugs by a dopamine-independent mechanism, demonstrated for psychostimulants and opioids. The endocannabinoid system also participates in the common mechanisms underlying relapse to drug-seeking behaviour by mediating the motivational effects of drug-related environmental stimuli and drug re-exposure. In agreement, clinical trials have suggested that the CB(1) cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant can cause smoking cessation. Thus, CB(1) cannabinoid antagonists could represent a new generation of compounds to treat drug addiction.","Human brain maturation is a complex, lifelong process that can now be examined in detail using neuroimaging techniques. Ongoing projects scan subjects longitudinally with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enabling the time-course and anatomical sequence of development to be reconstructed. Here, we review recent progress on imaging studies of development. We focus on cortical and subcortical changes observed in healthy children, and contrast them with abnormal developmental changes in early-onset schizophrenia, fetal alcohol syndrome, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Williams syndrome. We relate these structural changes to the cellular processes that underlie them, and to cognitive and behavioral changes occurring throughout childhood and adolescence.","During the past few decades, optical methods for imaging activity in networks composed of thousands of neurons have been developed. These techniques rely mainly on organic-chemistry-based dyes as indicators of Ca(2+) and membrane potential. However, recently a new generation of probes, genetically encoded fluorescent protein sensors, has emerged for use by physiologists studying the operation of neuronal circuits. We critically review the development of these new probes, and analyze objectives and experimental conditions in which classical probes are likely to prevail and where the fluorescent protein sensors will open paths to previously unexplored territories of functional neuroimaging.","Nascent glutamatergic synapses are thought to be equipped with only NMDA receptors and to mature in a stepwise fashion when AMPA receptors are acquired later, through specific patterns of activity. We review recent data suggesting that AMPA receptors are in fact present in the nascent synapse but in a labile state. The nascent synapse can easily switch between AMPA-signalling and AMPA-silent states in a manner not requiring activation of NMDA receptors or metabotropic glutamate receptors. NMDA receptor activation by correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity can switch the nascent synapse to a mature, more stable state, in which AMPA receptor signalling is modified only through conventional plasticity processes. Thus, the AMPA receptor silence of nascent glutamatergic synapses depends on the synaptic activation history rather than on the nascent state itself.","In vitro studies have widely demonstrated that the abundance and availability of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the cell surface is regulated by the neuronal environment and is the result of complex intraneuronal trafficking. However, this regulation is still poorly understood in vivo. Modulation of receptor availability at the neuronal membrane is a key event in the regulation of neuronal functions (e.g. neurotransmitter release or neuronal excitability in physiological, pathological or therapeutic conditions). We discuss the effects of duration of receptor stimulation (acute versus chronic) on the intraneuronal trafficking of GPCRs in vivo, and we show that this trafficking might differ according to subcellular compartment (soma, dendrites or axon terminals).","Accurate control of dopamine levels and/or the resulting dopamine-receptor interaction is essential for brain function. Indeed, several human neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system. Dopamine has been reported to exert either protective or toxic effects on neurons, yet it is unclear whether these effects are receptor-dependent and, if so, which dopamine receptor could be involved. The D(2) dopamine receptor occupies a privileged position because its signalling might be neuroprotective in human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, ischaemia and epilepsy. Unravelling the role of D(2) receptors in neuronal death and survival might be central to understanding the mechanisms that underlie several neuropathologies.","Mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and striatal cholinergic neurons (tonically active neurons, TANs) participate in signalling the behavioural or reward-related significance of stimuli in the environment. An antagonistic balance between dopamine (DA) and ACh is well known to regulate postsynaptic signal integration in the striatum. Recent findings have revealed additional presynaptic ACh-DA interactions of previously unappreciated sophistication. Striatal ACh acts presynaptically to polarize powerfully how opposing DAN activities are transduced into DA release. Furthermore, characteristic reward-related activities of TANs and DANs are temporally coincident but differently variant with reward probability. Reward-related DA signals could therefore be governed by the concomitant activity in TANs. This article discusses the dynamic implications for DA signalling when these phenomena act in concert. TAN pauses might powerfully enhance the contrast, or salience, of DA signals offered by reward-related bursts, and even by reward omission-related pauses, in DANs. Through such mechanisms, TAN-DAN interactions would be functionally cooperative.","Tourette syndrome (TS) is a developmentally regulated neurobehavioral disorder characterized by involuntary, stereotyped, repetitive movements. Recent anatomical and neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for abnormal basal ganglia and dopaminergic function in TS. Basic research on striatal inhibitory mechanisms and dopaminergic function complements the recent neuroimaging and anatomical data. Parallel studies of basal ganglia participation in the normal performance and learning of stereotyped repetitive behaviors or habits has provided additional insight. These lines of research have provided new pieces to the TS puzzle, and their increasing convergence is showing how those pieces can be put together.","Indispensable amino acids are neither synthesized nor stored in animals and are rapidly depleted when not provided by the diet. To maintain homeostasis, organisms must sense deficiency of an indispensable amino acid and implement a repletion strategy. In rats and birds, the anterior piriform cortex houses the detector, but its mechanism has evaded description for >50 years. Recently, rapid detection of amino acid depletion was shown behaviorally when naïve animals, pre-fed a low nitrogen diet, terminated their first deficient meal within 20 min. The general amino acid control system of yeast, which is activated by amino acid deprivation via deacylated tRNA, was found to be active in rodent brain, showing conservation of amino acid sensory mechanisms across eukaryotic species.","Microglia, the standby cells for immune defense in the CNS, have a reputation for exacerbating the neural damage that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. However, research over the past few years has established that microglia do not constitute a single, uniform cell population, but rather comprise a family of cells with diverse phenotypes--some that are beneficial and others that the CNS can barely tolerate and that are therefore destructive. This finding raised several questions. What instructs microglia to acquire a particular phenotype, and how do these phenotypes differ? How committed are microglia to a specific phenotype? Can destructive microglia become protective, and can protective microglia retain their beneficial phenotype even when they encounter a destructive environment? Here, we address these questions, and the background of research that elicited them.","The orbitofrontal cortex, as a part of prefrontal cortex, is implicated in executive function. However, within this broad region, the orbitofrontal cortex is distinguished by its unique pattern of connections with crucial subcortical associative learning nodes, such as basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens. By virtue of these connections, the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely positioned to use associative information to project into the future, and to use the value of perceived or expected outcomes to guide decisions. This review will discuss recent evidence that supports this proposal and will examine evidence that loss of this signal, as the result of drug-induced changes in these brain circuits, might account for the maladaptive decision-making that characterizes drug addiction.", ,"Glia are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian nervous system and they have vital roles in neural development, function and health. However our understanding of the biology of glia is in its infancy. How do glia develop and interact with neurons? How diverse are glial populations? What are the primary functions of glia in the mature nervous system? These questions can be addressed incisively in the Drosophila nervous system--this contains relatively few glia, which are well-defined histologically and amenable to powerful molecular-genetic analyses. Here, we highlight several developmental, morphological and functional similarities between Drosophila and vertebrate glia. The striking parallels that emerge from this comparison argue that invertebrate model organisms such as Drosophila have excellent potential to add to our understanding of fundamental aspects of glial biology.","Since the early 1960s it has been known that restoring extracellular Ca2+ following a period of low Ca2+ concentrations paradoxically causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels that can lead to cell death. The mystery of this 'Ca2+ paradox' is made more intriguing by observations that lowering concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ paradoxically enhances the entry of Ca2+ into hippocampal neurons. Until recently, the entry of Ca2+ through NMDA receptors was accepted as the major pathway leading to the excitotoxic, delayed cell death associated with the ischemic periods of stroke. Here, we discuss how several transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are likely to contribute to both the Ca2+ paradox and the delayed death of neurons following an ischemic stroke.","Social interactions, such as finding and identifying a mate, often rely on the ability to sense molecular cues carrying information about genetic relationship and individuality. We summarize recent evidence for an unexpected mechanistic link between the immune and olfactory systems in enabling this identification process. In addition to their established role in the immune response, peptide ligands of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules constitute a previously unknown family of social recognition signals detected by specific subsets of sensory neurons in the mammalian nose. This sensing of MHC peptides can be viewed as a form of functional genome analysis by the nose. Behavioral studies in mice and fish show that MHC peptides are accepted as olfactory cues that influence mate choice decisions and selective pregnancy failure. These findings provide a molecular mechanism by which an individual can sense the composition and compatibility of vital immune system molecules of a conspecific, with direct consequences for social behavior.","Many neurons in the CNS, including hypothalamic vasopressin-expressing cells, display rhythmic activity patterning. These vasopressin neurons receive random synaptic input but fire action potentials in alternating periods of activity and silence that each lasts tens of seconds. Recent work demonstrates that vasopressin cell rhythmicity depends on feedback modulation of intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic inputs by peptides released from the dendrites of these neurons. Many other neurons across the CNS release neurotransmitters from their dendrites; therefore, vasopressin cells provide an insight into the potential mechanisms that support neuronal activity patterning across the CNS.","Cell adhesion represents the most direct way of coordinating synaptic connectivity in the brain. Recent evidence highlights the importance of a trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic neuroligins and presynaptic neurexins. These transmembrane molecules bind each other extracellularly to promote adhesion between dendrites and axons. This signals the recruitment of presynaptic and postsynaptic molecules to form a functional synapse. Remarkably, neuroligins alone can induce the formation of fully functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons. Conversely, neurexins alone can induce postsynaptic differentiation and clustering of receptors in dendrites. Therefore, the neuroligin-neurexin interaction has the unique ability to act as a bi-directional trigger of synapse formation. Here, we review several recent studies that offer clues as to how these proteins form synapses and how they might function in the brain to establish and modify neuronal network properties and cognition.","Central neurons develop and maintain molecularly distinct synaptic specializations for excitatory and inhibitory transmitters, often only microns apart on their dendritic arbor. Progress towards understanding the molecular basis of synaptogenesis has come from several recent studies using a coculture system of non-neuronal cells expressing molecules that generate presynaptic or postsynaptic ""hemi-synapses"" on contacting neurons. Together with molecular properties of these protein families, such studies have yielded interesting clues to how glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are assembled. Other clues come from heterochronic cultures, manipulations of activity in subsets of neurons in a network, and of course many in vivo studies. Taking into account these data, we consider here how basic parameters of synapses--competence, placement, composition, size and longevity--might be determined.","Recent identification of network-level coding units, termed neural cliques, in the hippocampus has enabled real-time patterns of memory traces to be mathematically described, directly visualized, and dynamically deciphered. These memory coding units are functionally organized in a categorical and hierarchical manner, suggesting that internal representations of external events in the brain is achieved not by recording exact details of those events, but rather by recreating its own selective pictures based on cognitive importance. This neural-clique-based hierarchical-extraction and parallel-binding process enables the brain to acquire not only large storage capacity but also abstraction and generalization capability. In addition, activation patterns of the neural clique assemblies can be converted to strings of binary codes that would permit universal categorizations of internal brain representations across individuals and species.","Neural sensitivity to basic elements of the visual scene changes dramatically as information is handed from the thalamus to the primary visual cortex in cats. Famously, thalamic neurons are insensitive to stimulus orientation whereas their cortical targets easily resolve small changes in stimulus angle. There are two main types of cells in the visual cortex, simple and complex, defined by the structure of their receptive fields. Simple cells are thought to lay the groundwork for orientation selectivity. This review focuses on approaches that combine anatomy with physiology at the intracellular level, to explore the circuits that build simple receptive fields and that help to maintain neural sensitivity to stimulus features even when luminance contrast changes.","Understanding how complex neuronal circuits in the brain perform advanced computations is a central question in neuroscience that can only be addressed using a combination of approaches, including neurophysiology and behavioral analyses. In the olfactory bulb, neurophysiological studies have revealed that neuronal interactions reorganize odor-evoked activity patterns so that their discriminability is enhanced. Recent behavioral studies have examined the role of this computation in odor discrimination tasks and generated working models of behavioral odor discrimination strategies. The results appear consistent with a role of pattern reorganization in odor discrimination behavior but further studies are necessary to resolve this issue. These studies advance the understanding of neuronal circuit function in the olfactory bulb and illustrate benefits and caveats of comparing behavioral and neurophysiological results.","An issue of great recent interest is whether motor memory consolidates in a manner analogous to declarative memory--that is, with the formation of a memory that progresses over time from a fragile state, which is susceptible to interference by a lesion or a conflicting motor task, to a stabilized state, which is resistant to such interference. Here, we first review studies that examine the anatomical basis for motor consolidation. Evidence implicates cerebellar circuitry in two types of associative motor learning--eyelid conditioning and vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation--and implicates primary motor cortex in skilled finger movements. We also review evidence for and against a consolidation process for adaptation of arm movements. We propose that contradictions have arisen because consolidation can be masked by inhibition of memory retrieval.","Many academics, clinicians and lay readers of science incorrectly assume that vomeronasal processing is equivalent to pheromone processing. We review the abundant data concerning the roles of both the olfactory and the vomeronasal systems in the processing of both pheromones and other odorants, demonstrating that this ""equivalency hypothesis"" is untenable. This conclusion has important implications for the design and interpretation of experiments examining vomeronasal and olfactory system function. We describe some of the problems that arise from assuming that this equivalency holds. Two alternative hypotheses have been offered, but the available data do not enable us to accept or reject either one. Perhaps no single functional description can adequately characterize the role of the vomeronasal system.","Insertion of new neurons into adult neural circuits could either promote or impair circuit function, depending on whether homeostatic mechanisms are in place to regulate the resulting changes in neural activity. In the hippocampus (a mammalian forebrain structure important in aspects of memory and mood) several lines of behavioral evidence suggest important adaptive roles for adult-generated neurons, indicating that there could be mechanisms to control the potentially adverse increase in excitation associated with new cells. Here, we delineate behavioral and computational models for the role of circuit homeostasis in enabling neuron insertion to modulate hippocampal function adaptively, and we describe molecular and cellular mechanisms for implementing this circuit-level adaptive regulation of hippocampal activity.","Development of analgesic tolerance and withdrawal-induced pain enhancement present serious difficulties for the use of opioids for pain control. Although neuronal mechanisms to account for these phenomena have been sought for many decades, their bases remain unresolved. Within the past four years, a novel non-neuronal candidate has been uncovered that opposes acute opioid analgesia and contributes to development of opioid tolerance and tolerance-associated pain enhancement. This novel candidate is spinal cord glia. Glia are important contributors to the creation of enhanced pain states via the release of neuroexcitatory substances. New data suggest that glia also release neuroexcitatory substances in response to morphine, thereby opposing its effects. Controlling glial activation could therefore increase the clinical utility of analgesic drugs.","Accumulating evidence in humans and non-human primates implicates the posterior superior temporal plane (STP) in the processing of both auditory spatial information and vocal sounds. Such evidence is difficult to reconcile with existing accounts of the primate auditory brain. We propose that the posteromedial STP generates sequenced auditory representations by matching incoming auditory information with stored templates. These sequenced auditory representations are subsequently used to constrain motor responses. We argue for a re-assessment of the much-debated dorsal auditory pathway in terms of its generic behavioral role as an auditory ""do"" pathway.","Rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis of neurodegeneration has been tightly linked with recent discoveries in the field of programmed cell death (PCD). Analysis of PCD in neuronal demise has led to identification of several associated phenomena, such as re-initiation of the cell cycle and the key role of oxidative stress, although putative causal relationships between these events are still debatable. These issues are reviewed here in the context of acute and chronic neurodegenerative processes. In addition, newly emerging concepts concerning cell-cycle re-initiation are discussed in terms of their potential impact on the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.","Fear is an adaptive response to recognition of a potentially dangerous event. Glucocorticoids are essential for maintaining a wide variety of behavioral events by their regulation of numerous genes; one such gene encodes corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH is involved in diverse behavioral responses to changing environmental demands. In this review, we focus on one aspect of glucocorticoid regulation of CRH--namely, fear-related responses to diverse classes of adverse events, such as those represented by contextual and cue-specific stimuli. Three extra-hypothalamic forebrain sites appear crucial for fear-related behavioral responses: the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis for sustaining adaptive fear-related behaviors, and the medial prefrontal cortex for modulating fear-related behaviors. Central regulation of CRH by glucocorticoids is important for adaptive and sustained fear-related behaviors, and its aberration is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders.","Treatment of myelin loss is particularly suited to therapeutic strategies based on cell replacement. Demyelination represents a defined and functionally debilitating deficit, and remyelination can be accomplished by supplying regions of demyelination with myelinogenic cell populations. Clinical interest in stem cells as a source of myelinogenic cells arises from their ability to provide an apparently unlimited cell supply for transplantation, and from recent demonstrations that they can be directed to myelinogenic phenotypes with high purity. Here, I present the emerging perspective that stem-cell-mediated remyelination of the adult CNS is a viable therapeutic strategy, and discuss the challenges to remyelination posed by the environment of acute and chronic injuries.","All organisms must acquire nutrients from the ambient environment to survive. In animals, the need to eat has driven the evolution of a rich array of complex food-related behaviours that ensure appropriate nutrient intake in diverse niches. Here, we review some of the neural and genetic components that contribute to the regulation of food-related behaviour in invertebrates, with emphasis on mechanisms that are conserved throughout various taxa and activities. We focus on synthesizing neurobiological and genetic approaches into a neurogenetic framework that explains food-related behaviour as the product of interactions between neural substrates, genes and internal and external environments.","Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the same odorant receptor gene share ligand-receptor affinity profiles and converge onto common glomerular targets in the brain. The activation patterns of different ORN populations, evoked by differential binding of odorant molecular moieties, constitute the primary odor representation. However, odorants possess properties other than receptor-binding sites that can contribute to odorant discrimination. Among terrestrial vertebrates, odorant sorptiveness--volatility and water solubility--imposes physicochemical constraints on migration through the nose during inspiration. The non-uniform distributions of ORN populations along the inspiratory axis enable sorptiveness to modify odor representations by affecting the number of molecules reaching different receptors during a sniff. Animals can then modify and analyze odor representation further by the dynamic regulation of sniffing.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2006 Feb;29(2):65; author reply 66-7.,"Nearly ten years after its discovery as a crucial cell-cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is making a debut in neurobiology. During the past year, some of the mystery surrounding a potential function for APC in the brain has been unveiled. Recent studies have defined novel roles for APC in the regulation of axonal growth and patterning, as well as in synaptic development and function. With this strong beginning for APC in neurobiology, the months and years to come are likely to bring many more insights into how neuronal APC contributes to biological processes in brain development and disease.","Microglia form the first line of defence for the neural parenchyma. But do these cells pursue an active role in the normal brain, or do they become activated only after injury? Two papers published recently by Nimmerjahn et al. and Davalos et al. used in vivo two-photon laser-scanning microscopy reveal that the fine branches of 'resting' microglia are highly mobile, and provide extensive and continuous surveillance of their cellular environment. These moving branches show a rapid chemotactic response to tissue injury that depends on purine receptors and connexin hemichannels, and they appear to take cues from surrounding astrocytes both in the normal and the injured brain.","Unraveling the functional role of neuromodulatory systems has been a major challenge for cognitive neuroscience, giving rise to theories ranging from a simple role in vigilance to complex models concerning decision making, prediction errors or unexpected uncertainty. A new, simplified and overarching theory of noradrenaline function is inspired by an invertebrate model: neuromodulators in crustacea abruptly interrupt activity in neural networks and reorganize the elements into new functional networks determining the behavioral output. Analogously in mammals, phasic activation of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus in time with cognitive shifts could provoke or facilitate dynamic reorganization of target neural networks, permitting rapid behavioral adaptation to changing environmental imperatives. Detailed analysis and discussion of extensive electrophysiological data from the locus coeruleus of rats and monkeys in controlled behavioral situations is provided here to support this view. This simplified 'new look' at locus coeruleus noradrenaline function redirects the challenge of understanding neuromodulatory systems towards their target networks, particularly to the dynamics of their interactions and how they organize adaptive behavior.","Neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone and dentate gyrus might be utilized to replace lost neurons in neurological disorders. The development of treatments would be facilitated by identifying the mechanisms that contribute to functional neurogenesis in adult animals. This review focuses on the emerging view that localized and overlapping pathways of growth factors, metalloproteases, neurotransmitters and hormones regulate different aspects of neurogenesis within the neurogenic niches. Neuroblast migration is precisely regulated by cooperation between several repellants, attractants and guidance molecules that are located within specific CNS regions. Further elucidation of crucial molecular regulators and integration of their signaling cascades should lead to more rational and effective approaches to harness the exciting phenomenon of adult CNS neurogenesis.","During nervous system development, neural stem cells give rise to many different types of neurons and glia over an extended period. Little is known about the intrinsic factors that regulate stem-cell maintenance, decide whether neurons or glia are generated, or control terminal differentiation. Transcription factors of the Sox family provide important clues about the control of these events. In the central nervous system (CNS), Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 are required for stem-cell maintenance, and their effects are counteracted by Sox21. Sox9, by contrast, alters the potential of stem cells from neurogenic to gliogenic, whereas Sox10 is essential for terminal oligodendrocyte differentiation. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS) the same Sox proteins have different functions, uncovering important developmental differences between the CNS and PNS.","Neocortical GABAergic interneurons are a highly heterogeneous cell population that forms complex functional networks and has key roles in information processing within the cerebral cortex. Mechanisms that control the output of these cells are therefore crucial in regulating excitability within the neocortex during normal and pathophysiological activities. In addition to subtype-specific modulation of GABAergic cells by neurotransmitters released by afferents from subcortical nuclei, interneurons belonging to different classes are controlled by distinct self-modulatory mechanisms, each unique and powerful. In this article, we review the diverse responses of neocortical interneurons to extrinsic and intrinsic neuromodulators. We discuss how specificity of responses might differentially influence inhibition in somatodendritic compartments of pyramidal neurons and affect the balance of activities in neocortical circuits.","To understand the postnatal development of the cerebral cortex we must know how changes in one cortical area depend on inputs from other cortical areas. Do cortical areas serving early stages of processing (primary sensory receiving areas) mature first, passing relatively stable outputs about sensorimotor relationships to cortical areas involved in higher stages of processing that are still developing? And, if some areas mature later than others, do they have functions that can account for aspects of adolescent behavior? Some observations support concurrent maturation in all cortical areas, others support a hierarchical sequence. Here, evidence on this important issue is evaluated, and means of obtaining reliable information are presented.","The functions performed by different neural microcircuits depend on the anatomical and physiological properties of the various synaptic pathways connecting neurons. Neural microcircuits across various species and brain regions are similar in terms of their repertoire of neurotransmitters, their synaptic kinetics, their short-term and long-term plasticity, and the target-specificity of their synaptic connections. However, microcircuits can be fundamentally different in terms of the precise recurrent design used to achieve a specific functionality. In this review, which is part of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, we compare the connectivity designs in spinal, hippocampal, neocortical and cerebellar microcircuits, and discuss the different computational challenges that each microcircuit faces.","Realistic bottom-up modelling has been seminal to understanding which properties of microcircuits control their dynamic behaviour, such as the locomotor rhythms generated by central pattern generators. In this article of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, we review recent modelling work on the leech-heartbeat and lamprey-swimming pattern generators as examples. Top-down mathematical modelling also has an important role in analyzing microcircuit properties but it has not always been easy to reconcile results from the two modelling approaches. Most realistic microcircuit models are relatively simple and need to be made more detailed to represent complex processes more accurately. We review methods to add neuromechanical feedback, biochemical pathways or full dendritic morphologies to microcircuit models. Finally, we consider the advantages and challenges of full-scale simulation of networks of microcircuits.","To understand the interface between global brain function and molecular neuroscience--that is, the microcircuit level--a major challenge. Such understanding is prerequisite if we are to account for neural function in cellular terms. Very few vertebrate microcircuits are yet understood because their analysis is demanding technically. In this review of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, we attempt to shed light on the problem by comparing the operation of four types of microcircuit, to identify common molecular and cellular components. Central pattern generator (CPG) networks underlying rhythmic movements and hippocampal microcircuits that generate gamma and theta rhythms are compared with the neocortical microcircuits used in cognitive tasks and a cerebellar network. The long-term goal is to identify the components of a molecular and synaptic tool kit for the design of different microcircuits.",Molecules and cells are the signalling elements in microcircuits. Recent studies have uncovered bewildering diversity in postsynaptic signalling properties in all areas of the vertebrate nervous system. Major effort is now being invested in establishing the specialized signalling properties at the cellular and molecular levels in microcircuits in specific brain regions. This review is part of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature.,"Adaptation of an organism to its changing environment ultimately depends on the modification of neuronal activity. The dynamic interaction between cellular components within neuronal networks relies on fast synaptic interaction via ionotropic receptors. However, neuronal networks are also subject to modulation mediated by various metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors that modify synaptic and neuronal function. Modulation increases the functional complexity of a network, because the same cellular components can produce different outputs depending on the behavioural state of the animal. This review, which is part of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, provides an overview of neuromodulation in two neuronal circuits that both produce oscillatory activity but differ fundamentally in function. Hippocampal circuits are compared with the spinal networks generating locomotion, with a view to exploring common principles of neuromodulatory activity.", ,"The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are known to be crucial for learning arbitrary sensorimotor associations (e.g. knowing to stop at red traffic lights). However, little is known about the timing of learning-related activity in these brain systems. Conventional wisdom suggests that the prefrontal cortex should drive learning-related changes in the basal ganglia. However, it is possible that the basal ganglia are instead responsible for the development of learning-related activity in prefrontal cortex. Indeed, recent work using methods for recording in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia simultaneously suggests that learning-related activity emerges first in the basal ganglia. Here, these studies are reviewed and integrated with the known anatomy of corticostriatal connections. Testable hypotheses regarding corticostriatal interactions during learning are proposed.","Many diseases and injuries lead to loss of motor function. Can we reanimate paralyzed limbs to produce effective, graceful movements? Recent insights into the function of the motor system and greatly improved computing capabilities have made this a realistic goal, even in the absence of regeneration of motor pathways. Some approaches involve stimulating muscles, nerves or the spinal cord below the level of a lesion. Others involve recording a subject's intention from the cortex, and using this intention to control computers, robots or systems for stimulating the limbs. Here, we critically analyze the possibilities and limitations of various approaches for restoring motor function based on recent human trials and underlying neuroscience research.","It is widely acknowledged that the nature of the maternal care a child receives can have long-term repercussions, and that children raised in deprived environments can have severe cognitive and behavioural difficulties that last into adulthood. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not understood, but recent data from rodents provide insight into a potential molecular mechanism. Like humans, rodent maternal behaviour towards offspring can effect long-term changes in responses of the offspring to stress throughout the rest of their lives. Remarkably, these changes reflect permanently altered gene expression, so-called ""environmental programming"", and its downstream effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This review discusses the nature of this environmental programming--the mechanism by which it occurs in rats, its long-term implications, and opportunities for its reversal in rodents and ultimately in humans.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder presenting with autonomic failure and motor impairment, primarily comprising L-dopa-resistant parkinsonism but occasionally involving cerebellar ataxia. These features result from progressive multisystem neuronal loss that is associated with oligodendroglial alpha-synuclein inclusions. The growing number of animal models for MSA reflects the search for a preclinical test-bed for elucidating MSA pathogenesis and for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Here, the currently available MSA animal models will be reviewed and leads for future research will be identified.","Membrane proteins are a cell's first line of communication with the world that exists just beyond the plasma membrane. These proteins afford the cell a peek at its external environment, signal the cell to adjust its internal chemistry in response to its surroundings, and ensure that the cell's metabolic state is faithfully coupled to the outside world. Because of their importance in cellular communication, membrane proteins have been the focus of intense study at the functional and structural levels. Here, we describe optical techniques that can either passively monitor or actively control the structural rearrangements that take place as these proteins peek at the outside world. Our focus is on ion channels, but the techniques described can be applied to a host of other proteins.","Extracellular matrix molecules such as laminins have a central role in regulating cell behaviour. However, our understanding of their functions in the mammalian nervous system is incomplete. It is important to establish these functions, both for an understanding of normal development and to devise strategies to enhance repair. Here, we review how insights gained from human diseases caused by genetic mutations in laminins or their receptors have revealed significant and sometimes unexpected roles for laminins in neural stem cells, migrating neurons and myelinating glia, in both the PNS and CNS.","Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has emerged as a key regulator of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, a conceptually challenging question is how this diffusible molecule achieves local and synapse-specific modulation. One hypothesis is that neuronal activity enhances BDNF signaling by selectively modulating TrkB receptors at active neurons or synapses without affecting receptors on neighboring, less-active ones. Growing evidence suggests that neuronal activity facilitates cell-surface expression of TrkB. BDNF secreted from active synapses and neurons recruits TrkB from extrasynaptic sites into lipid rafts, microdomains of membrane that are enriched at synapses. Postsynaptic rises in cAMP concentrations facilitate translocation of TrkB into the postsynaptic density. Finally, neuronal activity promotes BDNF-induced TrkB endocytosis, a signaling event important for many long-term BDNF functions. These mechanisms could collectively underlie synapse-specific regulation by BDNF.","Motoneurons are selectively damaged in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, increasing evidence indicates that motoneurons are particularly sensitive to disruption of mitochondria and Ca(2+)-dependent signalling cascades. Comparison of ALS-vulnerable and ALS-resistant neurons identified low Ca(2+)-buffering capacity and a strong impact of mitochondrial signal cascades as important risk factors. Under physiological conditions, weak Ca(2+) buffers are valuable because they facilitate rapid relaxation times of Ca(2+) transients in motoneurons during high-frequency rhythmic activity. However, under pathological conditions, weak Ca(2+) buffers are potentially dangerous because they accelerate a vicious circle of mitochondrial disruption, Ca(2+) disregulation and excitotoxic cell damage.","Interleukin (IL)-18 is a potent inflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 family. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-18), which is cleaved into its functionally active form by caspase-1. Resident cells of the CNS express IL-18 and caspase-1 constitutively, thus providing a local IL-18-dependent immune response. Recent studies have highlighted a crucial role for IL-18 in mediating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the CNS under pathological conditions, such as bacterial and viral infection, autoimmune demyelinating disease, and hypoxic-ischemic, hyperoxic and traumatic brain injuries. This review provides a synopsis of the current knowledge of IL-18-dependent mechanisms of action during acute neurodegeneration in immature and adult brains.","According to a popular theory, the three presynaptic SNARE proteins (syntaxin 1, synaptobrevin 2 and SNAP-25) drive neuroexocytosis by forming a complex that forces vesicle and plasma membranes together. However, individual reactions in this process have been difficult to resolve. Now, two groups have succeeded in studying a very early and a very late step in the fusion process.","The transcription factor CREB is best known for its involvement in learning and memory. However, emerging evidence suggests that CREB activity has very different roles--sometimes beneficial, sometimes detrimental--depending on the brain region involved. Induction of CREB in the hippocampus by antidepressant treatments could contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. By contrast, activation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens and several other regions by drugs of abuse or stress mediates certain aspects of drug addiction, and depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. These complexities suggest that strategies that exploit regional differences in upstream factors or that target specific CREB-regulated genes, rather than CREB itself, could make a promising contribution to the treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions.","Parallel, largely segregated, closed-loop projections are an important component of cortical-basal ganglia-cortical connectional architecture. Here, we present the hypothesis that such loops involving the neocortex are neither novel nor the first evolutionary example of closed-loop architecture involving the basal ganglia. Specifically, we propose that a phylogenetically older, closed-loop series of subcortical connections exists between the basal ganglia and brainstem sensorimotor structures, a good example of which is the midbrain superior colliculus. Insofar as this organization represents a general feature of brain architecture, cortical and subcortical inputs to the basal ganglia might act independently, co-operatively or competitively to influence the mechanisms of action selection.","Starburst amacrine cells release two classical neurotransmitters, ACh and GABA. In a tour de force of paired-cell recording, Zheng et al. now show that the starburst cells are mutually excitatory during early development but mutually inhibitory in adult animals. The change occurs by remodeling of both the cholinergic and the GABAergic synapses between starburst cells. The finding gives a precise mechanistic basis for the developmental waves of activity in the retina.","Although K+ channels activated by Ca2+ have long been known to shape neuronal excitability, evidence is accumulating that K+ channels sensitive to intracellular Na+, termed K(Na) channels, have an equally significant role. K(Na) channels contribute to adaptation of firing rate and to slow afterhyperpolarizations that follow repetitive firing. In certain neurons, they also appear to be activated by Na+ influx accompanying a single spike. Two genes encoding these channels, Slick and Slack, are expressed throughout the brain. The spatial localization of K(Na) channels along axons, dendrites and somata appears to be highly cell-type specific. Their molecular properties also suggest that these channels contribute to the response of neurons to hypoxia.","Botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent toxins designed by nature. They are produced by Clostridium bacteria to cause long-lasting paralysis and death. However, in the past century one member of the botulinum family--botulinum neurotoxin type A--has been put to good use, and is now widely employed in clinical neurology and, even more often, in beauty clinics. This article will critically assess the value of individual members of the botulinum family for experimental neuroscience and medicine. The seven botulinum neurotoxins all act by targeting the same vesicle fusion machinery, and yet they cause paralysis of different durations. The distinct behaviors of botulinum neurotoxins will be discussed, with the aim of highlighting advantages and limitations for their future exploitation.","Memory consolidation and reconsolidation reflect molecular, cellular and systems-level processes that convert labile memory representations into more permanent ones, available for continued reactivation and recall over extended periods of time. Here, we discuss the complexities of consolidation and reconsolidation, and suggest they should be viewed not as all-or-none phenomena, but as a continuing series of biological adjustments that enhance both the efficiency and the utility of stored memories over time and in response to changing needs of the organism. As such, consolidation and reconsolidation might be better thought of as memory organization and reorganization. A rapidly growing body of evidence suggests that many of these processes are optimally engaged during sleep.","The past decade has been a fruitful one for geneticists involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) research. The initial hurdle of identifying the first gene underlying parkinsonism was cleared with apparent ease in 1997 and four additional genes have since been found to contain mutations causing this disorder. Driving this research is the belief that these data will highlight disease mechanisms and directly implicate a pathway amenable to therapeutic intervention. This article will focus on recent genetic advances in the field, focusing on data that suggest alpha-synuclein expression is key in the etiology of PD. In addition, it will discuss the recent identification of LRRK2 mutation as a cause of PD and the potential of this finding to provide further insight into disease.","Neuronal induction by retinoic acid (RA) is commonly used in embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. Two recent papers show that this paradigm induces a population of neurogenic precursors with properties of radial glia. Upon differentiation, RA-treated cells give rise to a defined and developmentally restricted neuronal lineage. This role of RA in cell fate specification provides new perspectives for studying the radial glia-neuron transition and for generating homogenous populations of neurons from ES cells.","Some of the signaling molecules required for formation of long-term memories are involved primarily in adult brain function, but others participate in a variety of other biological processes. The Notch signaling pathway, which is important for cell fate specification and differentiation in various systems, is also active in the mature brain. Here, we review evidence from recent studies indicating that Notch signaling is required for formation of long-term memories, and discuss possible memory processes modulated by this pathway. We also consider the possible involvement of Notch signaling in cognitive disorders.","Nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) can undergo desensitization, a reversible reduction in response during sustained agonist application. Although the mechanism of desensitization remains incompletely understood, recent investigations have elucidated new properties underlying desensitization, indicating that it might be important to control synaptic efficacy, responses to cholinergic agents, and certain nAChR-related disease states. Thus, studying how different nAChR subunits contribute to desensitization might help to explain variations in responsiveness to drugs, and might thus improve their therapeutic applications. Agonist-specific desensitization, desensitization arising from resting receptors, natural mutations dramatically altering desensitization, and the possibility that recovery from desensitization is an important process for modulating receptor function, together provide a new framework for considering desensitization as a target to shape cholinergic signaling.", ,"Immunochemical analyses of protein expression and localization rely on the specificity of primary immunoreagents. A recent report, using transgenic mice, casts doubt on the specificity of three antibodies commonly used to immunolocalize alpha7 nicotinic ACh receptors. These data highlight the conundrum facing histologists--how 'real' is the labelling they see?","Endocannabinoids, which are typically released by principal cells in response to prolonged depolarization, act as retrograde messengers to inhibit synaptic transmission. A recent study shows that in a specific subtype of cortical interneuron, endocannabinoids released under similar circumstances can also act cell-autonomously. Here, endocannabinoids endow these neurons with a memory of their own activity in the form of a long-term change in excitability.","The nervous system contains a toolbox of motor programs in the brainstem and spinal cord--that is, neuronal networks designed to handle the basic motor repertoire required for survival, including locomotion, posture, eye movements, breathing, chewing, swallowing and expression of emotions. The neural mechanisms responsible for selecting which motor program should be recruited at a given instant are the focus of this review. Motor programs are kept under tonic inhibition by GABAergic pallidal neurons (the output nuclei of the basal ganglia). The motor programs can be relieved from pallidal inhibition through activation of striatal neurons at the input stage of the basal ganglia. It is argued that the striatum has a prominent role in selecting which motor program should be called into action.","Recent advances in anatomical, physiological and histochemical characterization of avian basal ganglia neurons and circuitry have revealed remarkable similarities to mammalian basal ganglia. A modern revision of the avian anatomical nomenclature has now provided a common language for studying the function of the cortical-basal-ganglia-cortical loop, enabling neuroscientists to take advantage of the specialization of basal ganglia areas in various avian species. For instance, songbirds, which learn their vocal motor behavior using sensory feedback, have specialized a portion of their cortical-basal ganglia circuitry for song learning and production. This discrete circuit dedicated to a specific sensorimotor task could be especially tractable for elucidating the interwoven sensory, motor and reward signals carried by basal ganglia, and the function of these signals in task learning and execution.","The advent of high-quality 3D reconstructions of neuronal arbors has revived the hope of inferring synaptic connectivity from the geometric shapes of axons and dendrites, or 'neurogeometry'. A quantitative description of connectivity must be built on a sound theoretical framework. Here, we review recent developments in neurogeometry that can provide such a framework. We base the geometric description of connectivity on the concept of a 'potential synapse'--the close apposition between axons and dendrites necessary to form an actual synapse. In addition to describing potential synaptic connectivity in neuronal circuits, neurogeometry provides insight into basic features of functional connectivity, such as specificity and plasticity.","Our understanding of the operation of the brain depends on knowledge of its wiring. Currently, the wiring of the human brain is estimated by counting the number of neuron discharges that occur at specific times following a stimulus. There is now strong evidence that this approach generates significant errors. Recently, the accuracy of this 'count' method has been compared directly with an alternative 'rate' method in rat brain slices. The results confirmed that the count method generates significant errors that are minimized by the rate method, because the rate of discharge of a neuron accurately displays its excitability at the time of discharge. Therefore, it is now crucial that the rate method be used to reassess previous estimates of the characteristics of wiring in the brain.","Epidemiological evidence suggests a reduced incidence of many common types of non-smoking-related cancers in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Genes that underlie familial forms of PD are often abnormally expressed in cancer, owing to their differential regulation or mutation. Functional studies implicate these genes in maintenance of the cell cycle, in some cases through interaction in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Variation in genes associated with familial-linked PD could therefore modify susceptibility to both cancer and PD, implying some degree of overlap in the underlying biochemical dysfunction. When considering the normal function of these PD-linked genes in the periphery and their potential role in cancer, further emphasis might be placed on protein handling relating to cell-cycle control in the etiology of PD.","This review focuses on the epileptic human temporal lobe, primarily on recent findings related to changes in hippocampal GABAergic interneuron circuits that have a central role in epileptogenesis. Relying on correlations to animal studies, we provide a functional interpretation of the different changes in perisomatic inhibition (controlling output synchrony) and dendritic inhibition (controlling input plasticity), and the potential consequences of the loss of interneuron-selective interneurons. The highly heterogeneous, but specific, alterations of GABAergic interneuron circuits have important implications for the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy.","Brain function is fundamentally related in the most general sense to the richness of thalamocortical interconnectivity, and in particular to the rhythmic oscillatory properties of thalamocortical loops. Such rhythmicity is involved in the genesis of cognition, in the sleep-wake cycle, and in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The role of GABA-mediated transmission in regulating these functional states is addressed here. At the cortical level, inhibition determines the spread of cortical activation by sculpting the precise activity patterns that underlie the details of cognition and motor control. At the thalamic level, GABA-mediated inhibition modulates and resets distribution of the ongoing thalamocortical rhythmic oscillations that bind multisensory inputs into a single cognitive experience and regulate arousal levels.","Thalamic reticular neurons release the potent inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and their main targets are thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal thalamus. This article focuses on two topics: (i) the role of thalamic reticular neurons in the initiation of spindles, a hallmark oscillation during early sleep stages; and (ii) the reticular-induced inhibition of thalamocortical neurons during cortically generated spike-wave seizures. Although hotly debated during the past decade, the idea of spindle generation by a network of GABAergic reticular neurons was recently supported by in vivo and in computo studies demonstrating interactions between inhibitory reticular neurons that lead to spindle sequences. During spike-wave seizures and electrical paroxysms of the Lennox-Gastaut type, which arise in the neocortex, reticular neurons are powerfully excited through corticofugal projections and they produce prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in thalamocortical neurons. Thus, GABAergic reticular neurons are crucial in the generation of some sleep rhythms, which produce synaptic plasticity, and in inhibiting external signals through thalamocortical neurons, which leads to unconsciousness during absence epilepsy.","Chandelier or axo-axonic cells are the most selective of all cortical GABAergic interneurons, because they exclusively contact axon initial segments of cortical glutamatergic neurons. Owing to their privileged location on initial segments, axo-axonic cells have often been assumed to have the ultimate control of pyramidal cell output. Recently, key molecules expressed at the initial-segment synapses have been identified, and novel in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological studies have revealed unexpectedly versatile functional effects exerted by axo-axonic cells on their postsynaptic targets. In addition, there is also emerging recognition of the mechanistic involvement of these unique cells in several neurological diseases, including epilepsy and schizophrenia.","Recent work using paired recording has provided a direct demonstration of functional electrical synapses between neocortical neurons of both juvenile and adult animals. Electrical synapses have been found among GABAergic interneurons but not pyramidal cells. Interestingly, necortical electrical synapses almost exclusively connect GABAergic neurons belonging to the same class. So far, at least five different neocortical networks defined by extensive and selective electrical coupling have been studied in the neocortex. These results could provide important clues to the understanding of functional cortical circuitry.","Markers of the glutamatergic and GABAergic phenotypes coexist in developing hippocampal granule cells, and activation of these neurons produces simultaneous glutamate-receptor-mediated and GABA-receptor-mediated responses in their postsynaptic cells. In the adult, markers of the GABAergic phenotype and the consequent GABAergic transmission disappear but can be transiently expressed in an activity-dependent manner. Coexistence of glutamate and GABA in neurons from other regions of the brain is being discovered, and the possibility of these neurotransmitters being co-released gives the CNS a powerful computational tool. Although waiting to be confirmed by paired recordings, the hypothesis that glutamate and GABA are co-released from single cells is a valuable heuristic proposal in understanding the plasticity inherent to neuronal communication.","The ability to localize sound rapidly and accurately depends on the precise organization of inhibitory neuronal circuits in the auditory brainstem. However, the rules and mechanisms by which this precision is established during development are still poorly understood. Although activity-dependent reorganization has been known for over a decade to have a central role in this process, more recent studies have revealed an unanticipated degree of reorganization that occurs on levels ranging from cellular phenotype to network connectivity. These results suggest novel mechanisms by which immature inhibitory sound-localization circuits become optimized. Lessons from auditory brainstem circuits thus could provide insight into inhibitory development in other brain areas, where inhibitory networks are less experimentally accessible.","Although GABA remains the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain, there are numerous recent examples of excitatory actions of GABA. These actions can be classified in two broad categories: phasic excitatory effects, as follow single activation of GABAergic afferents, and sustained excitatory effects, as follow prolonged activation of GABA(A) receptors. Evidence reviewed here indicates that, contrary to common belief, these effects are not restricted to embryonic or neonatal preparations.","During brain development, transmitter-gated receptors are operative before synapse formation, suggesting that their action is not restricted to synaptic transmission. GABA, which is the principal excitatory transmitter in the developing brain, acts as an epigenetic factor to control processes including cell proliferation, neuroblast migration and dendritic maturation. These effects appear to be mediated through a paracrine, diffuse, non-synaptic mode of action that precedes the more focused, rapid mode of operation characteristic of synaptic connections. This sequential operation implies that GABA is used as an informative agent but in a unique context at an early developmental stage. This sequence also implies that by altering these effects, drugs acting on the GABA system could be pathogenic during pregnancy.","Use of cannabis as a medicine for numerous conditions has a well-documented history stretching back thousands of years. With the identification of an endogenous system of receptors and ligands in recent years, abundant experimental data have reinforced the anecdotal claims of people who perceive medicinal benefit from the currently illegal consumption of cannabis. This, combined with data from recent clinical trials, points to the prospect of cannabis as a medication in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and numerous other medical conditions.","Incoming signals from different sensory modalities are initially processed in separate brain regions. But because these different signals can arise from common events or objects in the external world, integration between them can be useful. Such integration is subject to spatial and temporal constraints, presumably because a common source is more likely for information arising from around the same place and time. This review focuses on recent neuroimaging data concerning spatial aspects of multisensory integration in the human brain. These findings indicate not only that multisensory integration involves anatomical convergence from sensory-specific ('unimodal') cortices into multisensory ('heteromodal') brain areas, but also that multisensory spatial interactions can affect even so-called 'unimodal' brain regions. Such findings call for a revision of traditional assumptions about multisensory processing in the brain.","Communicative, predatory, and reproductive behaviors rely on the auditory thalamocortical system, a key nexus that combines, transforms, and distributes virtually all acoustic information relevant to survival. The rules of connectivity for this complex network, both anatomically and functionally, are only beginning to be uncovered. Although the auditory thalamocortical system shares many features with other modalities, its connectivity and information processing principles differ from those of other modalities in many ways. Some physiological and anatomical bases for these differences are the subject of this review.","In contrast to the situation in the developing brain, neurons born during adulthood must integrate into established neuronal networks characterized by ongoing activity. For sensory systems, this neuronal activity is driven mainly by external stimuli that can lead to experience-dependent morpho-functional changes in adult circuits. Here, we describe new insights into the mechanisms by which sensory experience might govern the targeting of adult-generated neurons to appropriate regions, their differentiation into distinct neuronal subtypes, and finally their survival in the adult olfactory bulb. We propose not only that neurogenesis depends on the degree of sensory experience, but also that new neurons bring unique features to the operational network, allowing a continuous adjustment of information processing in response to an ever-changing external word.","Neuronal circuits are essential components of the nervous system and determine various body functions. To understand how neuronal circuits operate it is necessary to identify the participating neuronal subpopulations and to dissect the function of the neurons at the molecular level. The locomotor central pattern generator that coordinates body movements is well suited for elucidating the assembly and identity of the participating neurons. Remarkable advances in the field of genetics are making studies in neuroscience more efficient and precise so that now, using nematode worms, fruit flies, zebrafish and mice as model organisms, a genetic approach can be used to identify molecules and neurons crucial for locomotor network functionality.","Learning, memory and brain development are associated with long-lasting modifications of synapses that are guided by specific patterns of neuronal activity. Such modifications include classical Hebbian plasticities (such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression), which are rapid and synapse-specific, and others, such as synaptic scaling and metaplasticity, that work over longer timescales and are crucial for maintaining and orchestrating neuronal network function. The cellular mechanisms underlying Hebbian plasticity have been well studied and involve rapid changes in the trafficking of highly mobile AMPA receptors. An emerging concept is that activity-dependent alterations in NMDA receptor trafficking contribute to homeostatic plasticity at central glutamatergic synapses.","Timing of cellular and subcellular events contributes to spiking-induced modification of synapses in a variety of ways. Initially, the timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials must be translated into signals that can initiate intracellular processes. Recent experimental and computational findings suggest that the spatiotemporal details of such signals, in particular the time courses and locations of postsynaptic Ca(2+) transients, might themselves be crucial for driving potentiation and depression modules that interact in a time-dependent way to determine plasticity outcomes. On longer timescales, the effects of multiple spikes are integrated in a nonlinear manner, yielding non-intuitive plasticity results that are likely to be sensitive to local conditions and, finally, additional elements must be called into action to stabilize changes in synaptic strengths. This review is part of the TINS Synaptic Connectivity series.","Sox2 is expressed highly in the neuroepithelium of the developing CNS and has been shown to function in neural stem cells. Because Sox2-null mutant mice fail to develop beyond implantation, the role of SOX2 in the CNS has lacked validation. A new genetic model addresses the role of SOX2 in the adult brain and provides evidence that it is involved in the maintenance of neurons in specific regions, in the proliferation and/or maintenance of neural stem cells, and in neurogenesis.","The cellular components of the brain are neurons, glia and vascular cells. These three entities form a metabolic network to sustain brain activity. Interactions among these cell types have been studied extensively in vitro, where the cells are easily accessible to physiological and pharmacological manipulations. With the advent of optical tools, it has become possible to investigate the cerebral metabolic network in vitro at the cellular and subcellular levels. However, the metabolic and homeostatic nature of neuronal-glial-vascular interactions must eventually be examined in vivo, and multi-photon imaging now provides a means to monitor neurovascular units in living experimental animals.","Deep-brain stimulation at high frequency is now considered the most effective neurosurgical therapy for movement disorders. An electrode is chronically implanted in a particular area of the brain and, when continuously stimulated, it significantly alleviates motor symptoms. In Parkinson's disease, common target nuclei of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) are ventral thalamic nuclei and basal ganglia nuclei, such as the internal segment of the pallidum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), with a preference for the STN in recent years. Two fundamental mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of HFS: silencing or excitation of STN neurons. Relying on recent experimental data, we suggest that both are instrumental: HFS switches off a pathological disrupted activity in the STN (a 'less' mechanism) and imposes a new type of discharge in the upper gamma-band frequency that is endowed with beneficial effects (a 'more' mechanism). The intrinsic capacity of basal ganglia and particular STN neurons to generate oscillations and shift rapidly from a physiological to a pathogenic pattern is pivotal in the operation of these circuits in health and disease.","In contrast to traditional neuroncentric views of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent findings indicate that neurovascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. Here, I propose the neurovascular hypothesis of AD, suggesting that faulty clearance of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), aberrant angiogenesis and senescence of the cerebrovascular system could initiate neurovascular uncoupling, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion and neurovascular inflammation. Ultimately, this would lead to BBB compromise, to chemical imbalance in the neuronal environment and to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, injury and loss. Based on the neurovascular hypothesis, I suggest an array of new potential therapeutic approaches that could be developed for AD, to enhance A beta clearance and neurovascular repair, and to protect the neurovascular unit from divergent inducers of injury and apoptosis.","Neural circuits are composed of a meshwork of numerous neuron types, each with their own distinctive morphological and intrinsic physiological properties, connectivity and biochemistry. How do distinct neural subcircuits, composed of different classes of neuron, contribute to brain function? Approaching this question requires methods that can target specific neurons types. This can be achieved by harnessing the same machinery that builds sophistication into the brain and using it to make novel tools for investigating and manipulating the brain: molecular and genetic technology. These tools can be used to target gene expression to specific neuron types within complicated neuronal circuits, and the transgenes that are expressed can be used to elucidate and manipulate these circuits with unprecedented precision and control. These methods are likely to become the archetype for future studies linking perception, cognition and behavior to specific components of the brain.","Recent research results indicate that glial gap-junction communication is much more complex and widespread than originally thought, and has diverse roles in brain homeostasis and the response of the brain to injury. The situation is far from clear, however. Pharmacological agents that block gap junctions can abolish neuron-glia long-range signaling and can alleviate neuronal damage whereas, intriguingly, opposite effects are observed in mice lacking connexin43, a major gap-junction subunit protein in astrocytes. How can the apparently contradictory results be explained, and how is specificity achieved within the glial gap-junction system? Another key issue in understanding glial connexin function is that oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, each of which express distinct connexin isotypes, are thought to participate in brain homeostasis by forming a panglial syncytium. Molecular analysis has revealed a surprising diversity of connexin expression and function, and this has led to new hypotheses regarding their roles in the brain, which could be tested using new approaches.","Many forms of mental retardation and cognitive disability are associated with abnormalities in dendritic spine morphology. Visualization of spines using live-imaging techniques provides convincing evidence that spine morphology is altered in response to certain forms of LTP-inducing stimulation. Thus, information storage at the cellular level appears to involve changes in spine morphology that support changes in synaptic strength produced by certain patterns of synaptic activity. Because the structure of a spine is determined by its underlying actin cytoskeleton, there has been much effort to identify signaling pathways linking synaptic activity to control of actin polymerization. This review, part of the TINS Synaptic Connectivity series, discusses recent studies that implicate EphB and NMDA receptors in the regulation of actin-binding proteins through modulation of Rho family small GTPases.","We have developed a data-driven conceptual framework that links two areas of science: the source-filter model of acoustics and cortical sensory processing streams. The source-filter model describes the mechanics behind speech production: the identity of the speaker is carried largely in the vocal cord source and the message is shaped by the ever-changing filters of the vocal tract. Sensory processing streams, popularly called 'what' and 'where' pathways, are well established in the visual system as a neural scheme for separately carrying different facets of visual objects, namely their identity and their position/motion, to the cortex. A similar functional organization has been postulated in the auditory system. Both speaker identity and the spoken message, which are simultaneously conveyed in the acoustic structure of speech, can be disentangled into discrete brainstem response components. We argue that these two response classes are early manifestations of auditory 'what' and 'where' streams in the cortex. This brainstem link forges a new understanding of the relationship between the acoustics of speech and cortical processing streams, unites two hitherto separate areas in science, and provides a model for future investigations of auditory function.","The mechanisms underlying lesion formation in multiple sclerosis are unknown. The prevailing view is that macrophages are primary mediators of myelin destruction in the relapsing and remitting forms of this disease. However, recent findings have revealed widespread oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the absence of a clear cellular immune response. These observations unveil a novel aspect of the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis that is worthy of further exploration.","Both structure and function of the hippocampus are altered by stress: by increasing levels of corticosteroids, stress causes atrophy of CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites, inhibits adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and impairs hippocampus-dependent learning. A recent study shows that adverse experience limited to early life, specifically removal of rat pups from their mother for three hours each day, decreases production of new granule neurons in adulthood through a corticosteroid-dependent mechanism. This finding suggests that stress in early life could permanently impair hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and increase susceptibility to depression by inhibiting adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.","Spatial navigation depends on dissociable memory systems that have distinct neural bases and employ different forms of representation. One system gradually acquires reliable sequences of responses to given situations (e.g. repeatedly following a fixed route), and depends on the striatum. The other develops flexible representations permitting novel responses (e.g. finding new shortcuts), and depends on the hippocampus. Voermans and colleagues explore the interaction between these two systems using functional neuroimaging and behavioural measures in a clinical population.","Dendrites of pyramidal neurons are complex, electrically active structures that can produce local and global Ca(2+) compartments. Recent studies indicate that dendrites of cortical GABAergic interneurons are also highly specialized, and that different subtypes vary in their morphology, in their intrinsic and synaptic conductances and in the Ca(2+) signals they generate. Because interneurons play a major role in oscillations, understanding their dendrites could offer key insights into rhythmogenesis. Different interneuron subtypes have different synaptic integration properties and generate differentially timed inhibition at distinct sites of the pyramidal neuraxis. In addition, interneuron dendrites generate diverse Ca(2+) signals that reflect this circuit function and probably also implement subclass-specific plasticity and homeostasis.","Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is well established as providing a genetically based clock for timing circadian rhythms, the mechanisms by which the timing signal is translated into circadian rhythms of behavior and underlying physiology have only recently come to light. The bulk of the SCN outflow terminates in a column of tissue that arches upward and backward from the SCN, and which includes the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Neurons within the dorsal SPZ are necessary for organizing circadian rhythms of body temperature, whereas neurons in the ventral SPZ are needed for circadian rhythms of sleep and waking. Ventral SPZ neurons in turn relay to the dorsomedial nucleus, which is crucial for producing circadian rhythms of sleep and waking, locomotor activity, feeding and corticosteroid production. This multistage processor provides the animal with flexibility so that environmental cues, such as food availability, ambient temperature and social interactions, can be integrated with the clock signal to sculpt an adaptive pattern of rhythmic daily activities that maximize the chances of survival and reproduction.","Daily oscillations in physiology and behavior are regulated by a brain clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Individual cells within this nucleus contain an autonomous molecular clock. Recent discoveries that make use of new molecular and genetic data and tools highlight the conclusion that the SCN is a heterogeneous network of functionally and phenotypically differentiated cells. Neurons within SCN subregions serve distinctly separate functions in regulating the overall activity of the circadian clock: some cells within the SCN rhythmically express ""clock"" genes, whereas others exhibit induced expression of these genes after the organism has been exposed to a light pulse. The coordinated interaction of these functionally distinct cells is integral to the coherent functioning of the brain clock.","The senses of touch and hearing involve transduction of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. The search for components of the transduction apparatus in mechanosensory neurons has benefited greatly from genetic approaches using both invertebrates and vertebrates. A consensus model has emerged that includes extracellular and intracellular structural components arranged around a central mechanically gated channel. In the sensory hair cell of the inner ear, the extracellular structural component thought to have a key role in opening the transduction channel is the tip link. Although elusive for decades, recent studies have yielded candidates for both the transduction channel and the tip link in hair cells.","Concentration of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses is thought to result from stable binding to subsynaptic scaffold proteins. Recent data on synaptic plasticity have shown that changes in synaptic strength derive partly from modification of postsynaptic receptor numbers. This has led to the notion of receptor trafficking into and out of synapses. The proposed underlying mechanisms have under-evaluated the role of extrasynaptic receptors. Recent technological advances have allowed imaging of receptor movements at the single-molecule level, and these experiments demonstrate that receptors switch at unexpected rates between extrasynaptic and synaptic localizations by lateral diffusion. Variation in receptor numbers at postsynaptic sites is therefore likely to depend on regulation of diffusion by modification of the structure of the membrane and/or by transient interactions with scaffolding proteins. This review is part of the TINS Synaptic Connectivity series.","A common trend in neuroscience is convergence on selected model systems. Underlying this approach is an often implicit assumption that mechanisms observed in one species are characteristic of all related species. Although the model system approach has been extremely productive, it might not account for all of the mechanistic differences between species that differ behaviourally. Using the neural system that regulates song learning in songbirds as an example, we demonstrate how integrating model system and comparative approaches can lead to a more complete picture of neural mechanisms, and can resolve issues raised by a focus on selected species.","Contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have recently been used as cellular-level probes of neural function. New in vivo labeling strategies now enable researchers to follow plasticity of brain activation patterns and cellular structure over time. On the horizon is the prospect that molecular imaging agents specifically designed for functional imaging (fMRI) on a relatively fast timescale could offer an alternative to conventional hemodynamics-based approaches. Development of several MRI sensors has defined principles by which imaging agents for ""molecular fMRI"" can be constructed; application of engineered sensors for cellular-level correlates of neuronal activity would allow researchers to combine the noninvasiveness of MRI with spatial resolution of tens of microns and temporal resolution of 100ms or less. Facilitated by advances in imaging-agent delivery methods and model systems appropriate for high-resolution neuroimaging, novel molecular imaging strategies continue to potentiate MRI as a tool for mechanistic investigation of neural systems.","Neuronal activity is fueled by glucose metabolism, a phenomenon exploited in basic research and clinical diagnosis using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). According to the current view, glucose transport into the brain is not rate-limiting; thus, it cannot exert control over metabolism. This article challenges such a view by showing that basal transport hovers near its maximum, making metabolic activation unable to increase flux on its own. In the light of recent evidence on the identity of the cell type that preferentially breaks down glucose, we suggest that FDG-PET reports the synergistic activation of glucose transport and metabolism in astrocytes, rather than in neurons.","Because blocking GABAergic neurotransmission in control tissue generates seizures and because GABA boosters control epilepsy in many patients, studies on epilepsies have been dominated by the axiom that seizures are generated by a failure of GABA-mediated inhibition. However, GABAergic interneurons and synapses are heterogeneous and have many roles that go beyond the straightforward concept of ""inhibition of the target"". Operation of such a diversified system cannot be ascribed to a single mechanism. In epileptic tissue, GABAergic networks undergo complex rewiring at the anatomical, physiological and functional levels; GABAergic synapses are still operative but show unique features, including excitatory effects. Therefore, inhibition is not a uniform notion and the concept of ""failure"" of inhibition in epilepsies must be reassessed. Seizures are not generated in a normal circuit in which GABA-mediated inhibition is simply impaired, but in a profoundly rewired network in which several properties of GABA function are altered. This review is part of the TINS Interneuron Diversity series.","Neuropathic pain is a common and severely disabling state that affects millions of people worldwide. Such pain can be experienced after nerve injury or as part of diseases that affect peripheral nerve function, such as diabetes and AIDS; it can also be a component of pain in other conditions, such as cancer. Following peripheral nerve injury, microglia in the spinal cord become activated. Recent evidence indicates that activated microglia are key cellular intermediaries in the pathogenesis of nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity because P2X(4) purinoceptors and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which are present in activated microglia, are required molecular mediators. It is important to establish how these molecules are activated in spinal microglia following nerve injury and how they cause signaling to neurons in the dorsal horn pain transmission network. Answers to these questions could lead to new strategies that assist in the diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain--strategies not previously anticipated by a neuron-centric view of pain plasticity in the dorsal horn.","The cerebellar cortex forms a defined array of relatively simple neural networks. Considerable progress has been made towards understanding the synaptic mechanisms of these networks. It has been revealed that inhibitory GABA receptors and distinct types of glutamate receptor cooperatively and differentially regulate and integrate glutamate-mediated transmission within cerebellar cortical circuits. In addition, molecular assembly of receptor-interacting scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules is dynamically controlled and underlies the functional synaptic organization of cerebellar cortical circuits. This article discusses some of the recent progress in this area, focusing on newly explored aspects of the synaptic mechanisms of glutamate-mediated transmission in the cerebellar cortical network.","Previous open-label clinical trials have provided proof of principle that intrastriatal transplants of fetal dopaminergic neurons can induce substantial and long-lasting functional benefits in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, in two recent NIH-sponsored double-blind trials, functional improvements were only marginal and the primary endpoints were not met. Severe off-phase dyskinesias were observed in a significant proportion of the transplanted patients, raising doubts about the viability of the cell-transplantation approach. Here, we discuss the problems raised by the NIH-sponsored trials and point to several shortcomings that might explain the overall poor outcome, and we identify several crucial issues that remain to be resolved to develop cell replacement into an effective and safe therapy.","The principal ovarian estrogen, estradiol, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have widespread effects on the CNS that have usually been studied independently. This article examines the similarities in the effects of estradiol and BDNF in the hippocampus, in light of the evidence that estradiol can induce BDNF expression, and recent data suggesting that structural and electrophysiological effects of estradiol in the hippocampus might be mediated by BDNF. The possible role of BDNF as a signaling molecule downstream of estrogen in the hippocampus has implications for our understanding of several cellular and behavioral hippocampal functions, including dendritic and synaptic plasticity, learning and cognitive behavior. Furthermore, disruption of the relationship between estrogen and BDNF could contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders that have been associated with the hippocampus, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression and epilepsy.","Memory maintenance is widely believed to involve long-term retention of the synaptic weights that are set within relevant neural circuits during learning. However, despite recent exciting technical advances, it has not yet proved possible to confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous monitoring of individual connection weights during learning and retention. In such models, ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain previously stored material while learning new information. Thus, the duration of synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather, it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits.","Encoding and recall of memory sequences is an important process. Memory encoding is thought to occur by long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus; however, it remains unclear how LTP, which has a time window for induction of approximately 100 ms, could encode the linkage between sequential items that arrive with a temporal separation >100 ms. Here, we argue that LTP can underlie the learning of such memory sequences, provided the input to the hippocampus is from a cortical multi-item working memory buffer in which theta and gamma oscillations have an important role. In such a buffer, memory items that occurred seconds apart are represented with a temporal separation of 20-30 ms, thereby bringing them within the LTP window. The physiological and behavioral evidence for such a buffer will be reviewed.","The mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) system controls movement and emotional behaviour, and its degeneration causes Parkinson's disease and other psychiatric disorders. Recent findings are leading to better understanding of the genetic control of generation and functioning of the mesDA system. This advancement could disclose new perspectives for therapeutic approaches of mesDA-related disorders.",Glia have moved into the spotlight as participants in synaptic signaling. Recent work by Bergles and colleagues extends this active role by showing that oligodendrocyte precursors cells (OPCs) in the hippocampus receive functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Synaptic signaling in these cells could provide a mechanism for activity-dependent modulation of OPC proliferation and differentiation.,"For years, scientists investigating amyloid precursor protein (APP) have focused on its pathogenetic role in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Now, a study by Caille et al. adds new sites of action and new physiological functions for APP. They show that there are binding sites for secreted N-terminal nonamyloidogenic APP (sAPP) on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-responsive neural stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain, where sAPP acts as an EGF cofactor to stimulate proliferation of these cells. This result opens the hypothesis that changes in the levels of sAPP could influence activity of the neurogenic regions of the adult brain in normal and pathological conditions.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2005 Jul;28(7):346-7.,"In systems neuroscience, advances often come from lesioning and reversible inhibition of brain regions. Dissecting the circuitry of regions involves conceptually the same approach - stop a class of cell from firing action potentials, or make the cells fire more, then deduce how these components influence the performance of the circuit and animal behaviour. To perform such cell-type-specific and reversible fine-scale analysis of circuitry, and to do so on the fast signalling timescale of the brain (milliseconds to seconds), is challenging in mammals. Ingenious and diverse methods are being developed towards this goal. These new tools will encourage further synergy between molecular biologists, systems neuroscientists and electrophysiologists.","Members of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors are activated within the CNS in pathological settings of apoptosis and neurological disease. Recent work using several model systems provides accumulating evidence that these transcription factors also participate in the regulation of neuronal activity-dependent transcription and behavior under physiological conditions. This review highlights advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of Ca(2+)-responsive activation and synaptic signaling to the nucleus by NF-kappaB transcription factors within the CNS, and the relevance of this transcription factor family for learning and memory.","Drosophila neuroblasts are similar to mammalian neural stem cells in that they self-renew and have the potential to generate many different types of neurons and glia. They have already proved useful for uncovering asymmetric division components and now look set to provide insights into how stem cell divisions are initiated and terminated during neural development. In particular, some of the humoral factors and short-range 'niche' signals that modulate neuroblast activity during postembryonic development have been identified. In addition, recent studies have begun to reveal how the total number of cells generated by a single neuroblast is regulated by spatial and temporal cues from Hox proteins and a transcription-factor series linked to cell cycle progression.","Sensory neurons with short conduction distances can use nonregenerative, graded potentials to modulate transmitter release continuously. This mechanism can transmit information at much higher rates than spiking. Graded signaling requires a synapse to sustain high rates of exocytosis for relatively long periods, and this capacity is the special virtue of ribbon synapses. Vesicles tethered to the ribbon provide a pool for sustained release that is typically fivefold greater than the docked pool available for fast release. The current article, which is part of the TINS Synaptic Connectivity series, reviews recent evidence for this fundamental computational strategy and its underlying cell biology.","Prevailing models of memory identify mRNA translation as necessary for long-lasting information storage. However, there are enough instances of memory storage in the virtual absence of protein synthesis to prompt consideration of alternative models. A comprehensive review of the protein synthesis literature leads us to conclude that the translational mechanism is exclusively a permissive, replenishment step. Therefore, we propose that post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins already at the synapse is the crucial instructive mechanism underlying long-lasting memory. A novel feature of this model is that non-random spontaneous (or endogenous) brain activity operates as a regulated positive-feedback rehearsal mechanism, updating network configurations by fine-tuning the PTM state of previously modified proteins. Synapses participating in memory storage are therefore supple, a feature required for networks to alter complexity and update continuously. In analogy with codons for amino acids, a long-lasting memory is represented by a 'degenerate code' - a set of pseudo-redundant networks that can ensure its longevity.","At vanishingly low concentrations, factors of the neurotrophin family (NGF, BDNF, NT3 and NT4/5) can promote neuronal survival or death. Many investigations indicate that the survival-promoting signals of neurotrophins are generated by activation of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors and that their death-promoting signals are generated by activation of p75 neurotrophin receptors (p75(NTR)). Despite this, a body of work indicates that p75(NTR) can promote cell survival and Trk receptors can adversely affect neuron health. The potential mechanisms by which these receptors could have such diverse and antipodal effects are considered here.","Many behavioral responses are completed too quickly for the underlying sensory processes to rely on estimation of neural firing rates over extended time windows. Theoretically, first-spike times could underlie such rapid responses, but direct evidence has been lacking. Such evidence has now been uncovered in the human somatosensory system. We discuss these findings and their potential generalization to other sensory modalities, and we consider some future challenges for the neuroscientific community.","Synapses can change their strength in response to afferent activity, a property that might underlie a variety of neural processes such as learning, network synaptic weighting, synapse formation and pruning. Recent work has shown that synapses change their strength by jumping between discrete mechanistic states, rather than by simply moving up and down in a continuum of efficacy. Coincident with this, studies have provided a framework for understanding the potential mechanistic underpinnings of synaptic plastic states. Synaptic plasticity states not only represent a new and fundamental property of CNS synapses, but also can provide a context for understanding outstanding issues in synaptic function, plasticity and development.","It is a major recent finding that astrocytes can influence synaptic activity by release of glutamate, but many other glutamate-mediated activities are also controlled by astrocytes. Even the most obvious neuronal function of glutamate - its release as a transmitter - is regulated by astrocytes; these cells are needed for formation of precursors for glutamate synthesis, for reuptake of released transmitter, and for disposal of excess glutamate. Without astrocytic involvement, normal function of glutamatergic neurons is not possible, as exemplified by almost instantaneous abrogation of normal vision and learning upon inhibition of astrocyte-specific metabolic pathways. In addition, astrocytes are essential for production of the neuroprotectant glutathione, yet they can also contribute to neuronal death during ischemia by maintaining glutamine synthesis, enabling neuronal formation of neurotoxic glutamate.","The midbrain-hindbrain organizer (MHO) is a signalling centre that orchestrates development of the mesencephalic and anterior metencephalic primordia. In recent years, details have been revealed about the molecular nature of these signals, their transmission and reception, and the regulatory processes associated with MHO function. This article reviews recent progress in understanding the genetic and molecular components of the MHO, and how they synergize to control brain development.","Theories of developmental dyslexia differ on how to best interpret the great variety of symptoms (linguistic, sensory and motor) observed in dyslexic individuals. One approach views dyslexia as a specific phonological deficit, which sometimes co-occurs with a more general sensorimotor syndrome. This article on the neurobiology of dyslexia shows that neurobiological data are indeed consistent with this view, explaining both how a specific phonological deficit might arise, and why a sensorimotor syndrome should be significantly associated with it. This new conceptualisation of the aetiology of dyslexia could generalize to other neurodevelopmental disorders, and might further explain heterogeneity within each disorder and comorbidity between disorders.","To use sensory information efficiently to make judgments and guide action in the world, the brain must represent and use information about uncertainty in its computations for perception and action. Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are ""Bayes' optimal"". This leads to the ""Bayesian coding hypothesis"": that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.","The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has become a model for the study of a growing number of human characteristics because of the power of its genetics. Higher cognitive functions, however, might be assumed to be out of reach for the little fly. But the cumulative history of cognitive studies in insects and some of their arachnid relatives, as well as specific probing of the capabilities of fruit flies, suggests that even in this ethereal realm these creatures have much to contribute. What are the degrees of sophistication in cognitive behavior displayed by these organisms, how have they been demonstrated, and what is their potential for understanding how our own brains work?","There is general agreement that midbrain dopamine neurons play key roles in reward processing. What is more controversial is the role they play in processing salient stimuli that are not rewarding. This controversy has arisen for three main reasons. First, salient sensory stimuli such as tones and lights, which are assumed not to be rewarding, increase dopamine neuron activity. Second, aversive stimuli increase firing in a minority of putative dopamine neurons. Third, dopamine release is increased following aversive stimuli. Consequently, it has been suggested that these midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by all salient stimuli, rather than specifically by rewards. However, reconsideration of these issues, in light of new findings, suggests this controversy can be resolved in favour of reward theories.","One feature of addiction is the enhanced locomotor response known as behavioral sensitization that occurs with prolonged exposure to psychostimulants. In a recent study, Yao et al. have analyzed four distinct animal models that share this common phenotype. Evaluation of gene expression in the striatum reveals that postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, a synaptic scaffolding protein, is downregulated in each model, suggesting an essential role for this protein in addiction.","Genetic mouse models based on identification of genes that cause Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases have revolutionized understanding of the mechanistic pathophysiological progression of these disorders. These models allow the earliest manifestations of the diseases to be identified, and they display behavioral, neuropathological and electrophysiological deficits that can be followed over time in mechanistic and drug studies. An intriguing feature is that they do not reproduce the relatively selective and massive cell loss characterizing the human diseases. There is more information on Huntington's disease models because the disorder involves a single gene that was identified over ten years ago; genetic mutations causing Parkinson's disease are rare and were discovered more recently, and models of the disease have been generated only within the past few years.","A large body of phenomenological evidence implicates abnormal connectivity of brain macrocircuitry and microcircuitry in schizophrenia. Recent discoveries of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have zeroed in on the synaptic signaling machinery of cortical microcircuits as fundamental to disease causation and have militated for further revision of the role of dopamine in this illness. Dopamine, long implicated in psychosis and in antipsychotic drug effects, is crucial in optimizing signal-to-noise ratio of local cortical microcircuits. This action of dopamine is achieved principally by D1- and D2-receptor-mediated effects on pyramidal and local circuit neurons, which mediate neuronal excitability and recurrent inhibition and thus contribute to the stability of cortical representations of external and internal stimuli. In schizophrenia, an abnormal cortical dopamine D1/D2 activation ratio - in concert with, and in part related to, altered GABA and glutamate transmission - appears to interfere crucially with this process.","Tinnitus is an auditory phantom sensation (ringing of the ears) experienced when no external sound is present. Most but not all cases are associated with hearing loss induced by noise exposure or aging. Neuroscience research has begun to reveal how tinnitus is generated by the brain when hearing loss occurs, and to suggest new avenues for management and prevention of tinnitus following hearing injuries. Downregulation of intracortical inhibition induced by damage to the cochlea or to auditory projection pathways highlights neural processes that underlie the sensation of phantom sound.","The thalamus is strategically placed to control the flow of information to cortex and thus conscious perception. A key player in this control is a local GABAergic interneuron that inhibits relay cells. This interneuron is especially interesting because, in addition to a conventional axonal output, most of its output is via distal dendrites. The latter seem to be electrotonically and thus functionally isolated from the soma and axon, and they enter into complex synaptic arrangements. It is proposed that, because of special synaptic properties of its dendritic outputs, this local GABAergic interneuron of the thalamus provides gain control for the relay cell and thereby keeps relay of information to cortex within a fairly linear regime.","The vast majority of neostriatal neurons and intrinsic intrastriatal synapses are GABAergic, the latter arising from axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons and from GABAergic interneurons. An important feature of the functional organization of the neostriatum has long been assumed to be the existence of a widespread lateral inhibitory network mediated by the axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons. However, these collateral connections have recently been demonstrated electrophysiologically to be relatively weak--in contrast to feedforward interneuronal inhibition, which exerts strong effects on spike timing in spiny neurons. These new data are incompatible with current ""winner-take-all"" models of lateral inhibitory function in the neostriatum, and they force a modification of established concepts of the functional roles of feedback inhibition in this nucleus.","In the developing nervous system, growth cones follow specific trajectories to reach their target area and ultimately connect with their correct postsynaptic partners. This review focuses on studies in both Drosophila and vertebrates to highlight that mutual interactions between neurons and glia are essential in forming specific neuronal connections. Glia signal to neurons to direct pathfinding and targeting of axons, as well as to stabilize and refine axonal branches within the target area. Equally, neurons provide crucial information to glia, supporting their migration and correct positioning.","The importance of auditory feedback in the development of spoken language in humans is striking. Paradoxically, although auditory-feedback-dependent vocal plasticity has been shown in a variety of taxonomic groups, there is little evidence that our nearest relatives--non-human primates--require auditory feedback for the development of species-typical vocal signals. Because of the apparent lack of developmental plasticity in the vocal production system, neuroscientists have largely ignored the neural mechanisms of non-human primate vocal production and perception. Recently, the absence of evidence for vocal plasticity from developmental studies has been contrasted with evidence for vocal plasticity in adults. We argue that this new evidence makes non-human primate vocal behavior an attractive model system for neurobiological analysis.","Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, a family of G-protein-coupled receptors, are thought to signal through the phospholipase and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor system, or through the adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase C system. Rong et al. have recently identified a new phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE-L) that links group I mGlu receptors (mGluRI) to PI 3-kinase through Homer proteins, adaptors that bind mGluRI. mGluRI agonists enhanced mGluRI-Homer-PIKE-L complex formation, leading to activation of PI 3-kinase and inhibition of staurosporine-induced neuronal apoptosis. These results reveal a novel anti-apoptotic signaling mechanism that involves formation of an mGluRI signaling complex.","Only after injury, or perhaps prolonged exposure to cold that is sufficient to numb the fingers, do we suddenly appreciate the complex neural mechanisms that underlie our effortless dexterity in manipulating objects. The nervous system is capable of adapting grip forces to a wide range of object shapes, weights and frictional properties, to provide optimal and secure handling in a variety of potentially perturbing environments. The dynamic interplay between sensory information and motor commands provides the basis for this flexibility, and recent studies supply somewhat unexpected evidence of the essential role played by cutaneous feedback in maintaining and acquiring predictive grip force control. These examples also offer new insights into the adaptive control of other voluntary movements.","Some researchers and many in the lay public believe the ageist myth that the older you get the sicker you get. If this were true, it would follow that most if not all centenarians should have Alzheimer's disease. Numerous centenarian studies disprove this assumption given that a small percentage ( approximately 15-25%) of centenarians are functionally cognitively intact. Among those who are not cognitively intact at 100, approximately 90% delayed the onset of clinically evident impairment at least until an average age of 92 years. Neuropsychological and neuropathological correlations thus far suggest that there are centenarians who demonstrate no evidence of neurodegenerative disease. There also appear to be centenarians who, despite the substantial presence of neuropathological markers of Alzheimer's disease, do not meet clinical criteria for having dementia, thus suggesting the existence of cognitive reserve. Centenarians are therefore of scientific interest as a human model of relative resistance to dementia.","Although current research on brain aging is dominated by Alzheimer's disease (AD), many other brain changes arise during middle age in humans and in rodent models that are independent of AD-like neurodegeneration. Differences and continuities between normal and pathological aspects of neuronal aging reveal the relative contributions and interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein E alleles might be prototypes for genetic polymorphisms associated with functional changes that arise during middle age. Mice are valuable models for these aspects of aging because most genotypes show little neurodegeneration, and none accumulate beta-amyloid unless human transgenes are introduced. As further human genes are found to modify normal and pathological neuronal aging, this zoo of aging-animal variants will facilitate analysis both of pathways of age-related neuronal dysfunction and of environmental influences on these pathways.","Cognitive aspects of aging represent a grave challenge for our societal circumstances as members of the baby-boom generation spiral toward a collective 'senior moment'. In addition, age-related changes in the CNS can contribute to motor deficits and other somatic aberrations. Inflammation and its regulation by cytokines have been connected to many aspects of aging, and mechanisms addressed here provide a rationale for this. Nevertheless, a role for cytokines in normal aging of the human brain has not been confirmed, and it seems to be possible to ameliorate both cognitive decline and cytokine elevation via lifestyle choices. So ignorance of the brain should not prohibit development of successful strategies for delaying or avoiding neurological deficits.","Understanding the cellular mechanisms that characterize the functional changes of the aged brain is an ongoing and formidable challenge for the neuroscience community. Evidence now links changes in Ca(2+) influx and homeostasis with perturbations induced by the aging process in the function of the main intracellular organelles involved in Ca(2+) regulation: the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. New perspectives are also offered by recent gene microarray studies, illustrating the multifactorial nature of the aging process.","The human brain is uniquely powerful with respect to cognitive abilities, yet the hippocampal and neocortical circuits that mediate such complex functions are highly vulnerable to aging. Their selective vulnerability is profoundly manifested in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where degeneration of select neurons leads to a near complete loss of cognitive abilities. Most of us will avoid AD as we age. However, many will experience age-associated cognitive impairment - a decline in cognitive status presenting as deficits in memory and key capacities for strategic use of acquired information. Animal studies suggest that both AD and age-associated cognitive impairment reflect vulnerability of the same circuits. However, neuron death predominates in the former, whereas the latter is probably mediated by synaptic alterations in otherwise intact circuits. Fortunately, such age-related synaptic alterations could be reversible, as suggested by recent studies of hormone replacement.","Mitochondria and aging are fast becoming two of the most paired terms in biology. As a crucial nexus for the cell, mitochondria are involved in numerous essential aspects of cell function, from energy production via the respiratory chain to steroid biosynthesis, heme assembly, pyrimidine biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and apoptosis. Mitochondria are also the main producers of reactive oxygen species within the cell. Theories about aging have revolved around mitochondria for decades, but it is only in the past few years that animal models have started to give significant insights into mitochondria-mediated pathophysiology that might be intimately associated with aging. This review will highlight several new animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of aging.","Aging is characterized by decrements in maximum function and accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations, which are best observed in organs such as the brain that contain post-mitotic cells. Oxygen radicals are increasingly considered responsible for part of these aging changes. Comparative studies of animals with different aging rates have shown that the rate of mitochondrial oxygen radical generation is directly related to the steady-state level of oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and is inversely correlated with maximum longevity in higher vertebrates. The degree of unsaturation of tissue fatty acids also correlates inversely with maximum longevity. These are the two known traits connecting oxidative stress with aging. Furthermore, caloric restriction, which decreases the rate of aging, proportionately decreases mitochondrial oxygen radical generation, especially at complex I. These findings are reviewed, highlighting the results obtained in the brain.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal survival in the adult brain. These two signals co-regulate one another such that 5-HT stimulates the expression of BDNF, and BDNF enhances the growth and survival of 5-HT neurons. Impaired 5-HT and BDNF signaling is central to depression and anxiety disorders, but could also play important roles in the pathogenesis of several age-related disorders, including insulin resistance syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Enhancement of BDNF signaling may be a key mechanism whereby cognitive stimulation, exercise, dietary restriction and antidepressant drugs preserve brain function during aging. Behavioral and pharmacological manipulations that enhance 5-HT and BDNF signaling could help promote healthy brain aging.","The basal ganglia are more highly interconnected with the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) than with any other brain region. Regulation and relay of basal ganglia activity are two key functions of the PPN. The PPN provides an interface for the basal ganglia to influence sleep and waking, and the two structures are similarly implicated in learning, reward and other cognitive functions. Perturbations of basal ganglia activity have consequences for the PPN and vice versa, exemplified by their interdependencies in motor function and Parkinson's disease. Thus, close anatomical and physiological links between the PPN and basal ganglia make it increasingly difficult to consider the two as separate functional entities.","The neurokinin-1 receptor is expressed by lamina I projection neurons of the spinal cord that are crucial for regulating pain behavior. These neurons are nocispecific, support long-term potentiation and appear to downregulate the K(+)-Cl(-) exporter channel KCC2 following peripheral nerve damage, leading to increased excitability. These lamina I neurons project to the brainstem and thalamus and modulate descending inhibitory and excitatory pathways to the dorsal horn that regulate nociceptive traffic.",A genetic screen for resistance to ethanol intoxication in Caenorhabditis elegans isolated mutants of the gene slo-1. slo-1 encodes the pore-forming subunit of a large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel previously shown to limit excitatory neurotransmitter release in C. elegans. Electrophysiological data recorded in vivo are consistent with a model in which ethanol potentiation of SLO-1 produces intoxication in C. elegans by reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release., ,"In the brain, highly connected and heterogeneous GABAergic cells are crucial in controling the activity of neuronal networks. They accomplish this task by communicating through remarkably diverse sets of inhibitory processes, the complexity of which is reflected by the variety of interneuron classification schemes proposed in recent years. It is now becoming clear that the subcellular localization and intrinsic properties of heteropentameric GABA(A) receptors themselves also constitute major sources of diversity in GABA-mediated signaling. This review summarizes some of the factors underlying this diversity, including GABA(A) receptor subunit composition, localization, activation, number and phosphorylation states, variance of GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, and some of the presynaptic factors regulating GABA release.","Epidemiological studies show that smoking is associated with a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). This finding is important because it could provide clues about therapeutic strategies for protection against this debilitating movement disorder. Smoke contains numerous chemicals that could be responsible for the apparent protective effect. Here, a role for nicotine is considered, because this chemical stimulates brain dopaminergic systems and provides some symptomatic benefit in PD. Nicotine also has a neuroprotective action. Putative factors and signaling pathways involved in the actions of nicotine are discussed. An understanding of the molecular basis for the reduced occurrence of PD in tobacco users is crucial for the development of intervention strategies to reduce or halt disease progression.","Plasticity of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse plays a crucial role in learning and memory of withdrawal reflexes. During the past ten years, a growing body of evidence has indicated that the sensorimotor synapse is glutamatergic. This new information has guided several studies that implicate AMPA and NMDA receptors in synaptic plasticity. However, further work is necessary to delineate the exact properties of the postsynaptic receptors, and their role in transmission and plasticity. Despite the still incomplete picture of the intrinsic properties of the sensorimotor synapse, identifying the endogenous transmitter has provided a foundation for new avenues of research, the results of which will further improve our understanding of the neurobiology of learning and memory.","Studies from a variety of synapses indicate that the time course of endocytosis ranges from less than a second to hundreds of seconds. This raises questions about how the time course of endocytosis is regulated and why different rates of endocytosis are needed. Recent progress sheds light on these issues. Neuronal firing frequency and duration determine the time course of endocytosis. The dynamic nature of this time course could be a result of multiple endocytic pathways and/or of regulation by a variety of modulators. Because endocytosis is crucial for maintaining transmitter release during repetitive stimulation, regulation of endocytosis could thus provide a mechanism by which synaptic plasticity is achieved.","Formation of synapses by neurons onto specific targets is essential to the function of a nervous system. The isolation and analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila mutants with synaptogenesis defects has provided insight into the functions of evolutionarily conserved molecules at single-synapse resolution. Importantly, such studies have uncovered novel molecules and signaling mechanisms. Here, recent progress on synaptic target recognition and synaptic assembly are reviewed.","Topography of axonal projections has been generally thought to arise from positional information located within the projecting and targeted structures, independent of events along the path or within the axonal bundle. Recent evidence suggests that in the projection from the dorsal thalamus to the neocortex, initial rostrocaudal targeting of axons is regulated at the level of an intermediate target, the subcortical telencephalon. In this system, thalamic axons are spatially positioned within the subcortical telencephalon, partly via interactions between EphAs and ephrin-As, and this positioning apparently determines the rostrocaudal level of the neocortex that the axons will initially target.","Recent studies have identified Wnt proteins as conserved axon guidance molecules in vertebrates and invertebrates. Wnt proteins are a large family of diffusible factors that play several important roles, both in embryonic development and in adult function. The signaling mechanisms of Wnt proteins are complex and, because Wnts are newly discovered as axon guidance cues, little is known about how Wnt signaling controls the direction of growth cone navigation - a process that is crucial in development of the nervous system. This review summarizes recent work on the role of Wnts in axon guidance and discusses the possible signaling mechanisms involved in growth cone guidance. Understanding how Wnts regulate axon wiring will not only help us to understand how the nervous system is connected but also provide possible tools for axon regeneration.","Although the existence of thalamostriatal projections has long been known, the role(s) of this system in the basal ganglia circuitry remains poorly characterized. The intralaminar and ventral motor nuclei are the main sources of thalamic inputs to the striatum. This review emphasizes the high degree of anatomical and functional specificity of basal ganglia-thalamostriatal projections and discusses various aspects of the synaptic connectivity and neurochemical features that differentiate this glutamate system from the corticostriatal network. It also discusses the importance of thalamostriatal projections from the caudal intralaminar nuclei in the process of attentional orientation. A major task of future studies is to characterize the role(s) of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal pathways in regulating basal ganglia activity in normal and pathological conditions.","It is well established that genetic factors strongly contribute to the susceptibility of an individual to schizophrenia. Straub, Kendler and colleagues have published the first of several articles demonstrating a genetic association between schizophrenia and the gene encoding the dystrobrevin-binding protein dysbindin. Although no mutations in the dysbindin gene have been found, the recent identification of a specific risk haplotype in independent samples provides further evidence that dysbindin is a possible schizophrenia susceptibility gene.","Circadian clocks have been localized to discrete sites within the nervous systems of several organisms, and in mammals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus. The clock in the SCN is composed of multiple autonomous single-cell oscillators, and new studies now allow an unprecedented look at their oscillatory activities over repeated cycles in tissue slices in vitro. Initial data reinforce the importance of intercellular membrane events for constructing a functional and reliable tissue pacemaker.","To understand the role of a gene in adult behavior, it is necessary to control its expression in four dimensions: space and time. Two recent papers describe implementation of different but related technologies that now provide this missing element in fly behavioral research.","Interneuronal diversity reflects the division of labor between numerous highly specialized interneuronal species, each performing a set of specific functions in neuronal networks. The rich diversity of interneurons found in the normal healthy brain is often significantly altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases. In genetic and developmental disorders, the diversity of interneuronal networks is compromised because of disturbances in the generation, specification or migration of specific interneuronal subtypes. Following insults related to trauma and seizures, the relative abundance of interneuronal subtypes might change, and entire interneuronal species can be lost from the network. In addition to the complete or partial loss of interneuronal subgroups, heterogeneity can also be altered in more subtle ways, as a result of changes in cell-to-cell variance of a particular parameter within specific interneuronal populations. Computational and experimental studies show that alterations in cellular and synaptic GABAergic heterogeneity can significantly modulate both firing rates and network coherence, indicating that plasticity of interneuronal diversity is likely to be an important mechanistic component of malfunctioning cortical networks in many pathological states.","Historically, different groups of researchers have investigated the mechanisms of perceptual learning and motor learning. For sensory cortex, neurophysiological and psychophysical findings have linked changes in perception with altered neuronal tuning properties. However, less information has been forthcoming from motor cortex. This review compares recent findings on perceptual and motor learning, and suggests that similar mechanisms govern both. These mechanisms involve changes in both the center of neuronal tuning functions and their width or slope. The former reflects the values of the sensory or motor parameters that a neuron encodes, and the latter adjusts the encoding sensitivity. These similarities suggest that specific unifying principles for neural coding and computation exist across sensory and motor domains.","The complex activities of the brain need not distract us from the certainty that it uses energy and performs work very efficiently. The human brain, which claims approximately 2% of our body mass, is responsible for approximately 20% of our body oxygen consumption. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) follows the metabolic pathways of energy production (as glucose oxidation) and work (as monitored by the cycling of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters). In the resting awake state, approximately 80% of energy used by the brain supports events associated with neuronal firing and cycling of GABA and glutamate neurotransmitters. Small differences in neuronal activity between stimulation and control conditions can be measured and localized using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MRS and fMRI experiments show that the majority of cerebral activity, which is often disregarded in imaging experiments, is ongoing even when the brain appears to be doing nothing.","Assembly of neuronal circuits is controlled by the sequential acquisition of neuronal subpopulation-specific identities at progressive developmental steps. Whereas neuronal features involved in initial phases of differentiation are already established at cell-cycle exit, recent findings, based mainly on work in the peripheral nervous system, suggest that the timely integration of signals encountered en route to targets and from the target region itself is essential to control late steps in connectivity. As neurons project towards their targets they require target-derived signals to establish mature axonal projections and acquire neuronal traits such as the expression of distinct combinations of neurotransmitters. Recent evidence presented in this review shows that this principle, of a signaling interplay between target-derived signals and neuronal cell bodies, is often mediated through transcriptional events and is evolutionarily conserved.","Functional studies at the level of individual neurons have greatly contributed to our current understanding of basal ganglia function and dysfunction. However, identification of the expressed genes responsible for these distinct neuronal phenotypes is less advanced. Qualitative and quantitative single-cell gene-expression profiling, combined with electrophysiological analysis, allows phenotype-genotype correlations to be made for individual neurons. In this review, progress on gene-expression profiling of individual, functionally characterized basal ganglia neurons is discussed, focusing on ion channels and receptors. In addition, methodological issues are discussed and emerging novel techniques are introduced that will enable a genome-wide comparison of function and gene expression for individual neurons.","Since its conception three decades ago, the idea that the striatum consists of a dorsal sensorimotor part and a ventral portion processing limbic information has sparked a quest for functional correlates and anatomical characteristics of the striatal divisions. But this classic dorsal-ventral distinction might not offer the best view of striatal function. Anatomy and neurophysiology show that the two striatal areas have the same basic structure and that sharp boundaries are absent. Behaviorally, a distinction between dorsolateral and ventromedial seems most valid, in accordance with a mediolateral functional zonation imposed on the striatum by its excitatory cortical, thalamic and amygdaloid inputs. Therefore, this review presents a synthesis between the dorsal-ventral distinction and the more mediolateral-oriented functional striatal gradient.","Experience-dependent changes in corticostriatal transmission efficacy are likely to support the role of the striatum in reinforcement-based motor learning. Whereas long-term depression at glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses has long been regarded as the normal form of striatal plasticity, recent work provides evidence that use-dependent potentiation can naturally occur at these connections through an increase in both synaptic efficacy and postsynaptic intrinsic excitability. By decreasing the weight of cortical inputs required to fire striatal output neurons, short-term and long-term potentiation at corticostriatal connections can jointly participate in the formation of sensorimotor links by which specific context-dependent patterns of cortical activity can engage selected motor programs.","With the rapid accumulation of neuroscientific data comes a pressing need to develop models that can explain the computational processes performed by the basal ganglia. Relevant biological information spans a range of structural levels, from the activity of neuronal membranes to the role of the basal ganglia in overt behavioural control. This viewpoint presents a framework for understanding the aims, limitations and methods for testing of computational models across all structural levels. We identify distinct modelling strategies that can deliver important and complementary insights into the nature of problems the basal ganglia have evolved to solve, and describe methods that are used to solve them.","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis originates from precursor cells in the adult dentate gyrus and results in new granule cell neurons. We propose a model of the development that takes place between these two fixed points and identify several developmental milestones. From a presumably bipotent radial-glia-like stem cell (type-1 cell) with astrocytic properties, development progresses over at least two stages of amplifying lineage-determined progenitor cells (type-2 and type-3 cells) to early postmitotic and to mature neurons. The selection process, during which new neurons are recruited into function, and other regulatory influences differentially affect the different stages of development.", ,"Neuroimaging is often pilloried for providing little more than pretty pictures that simply show where activity occurs in the brain. Strong critics (notably Uttal) have even argued that neuroimaging is nothing more than a modern day version of phrenology: destined to fail, and fundamentally uninformative. Here, I make the opposite case, arguing that neuroimaging is in a vibrant and healthy state of development. As recent investigations of memory illustrate, when used well, neuroimaging goes beyond asking 'where' activity is occurring, to ask questions concerned more with 'what' functional role the activity reflects.","It is almost axiomatic in neuroscience that postsynaptically induced NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) is a cellular substrate of memory. As a result, memory impairments caused by experimental reductions of NMDA currents are often interpreted as evidence that this form of plasticity is involved in memory formation. However, a recent Nature study indicates that not all NMDA-dependent LTP is induced postsynaptically.","This article focuses on NMDA receptor subunit changes that occur in the forebrain and midbrain during development, namely the switch from predominance of NMDA receptors rich in NR2B subunits to that of NMDA receptors rich in NR2A subunits. We review the potential roles in brain plasticity of two membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs), SAP102 and PSD95, which form a scaffold for the ion-passing glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic density, and we consider the known functional significance of these molecules in subunit switching. In addition, based on recent analyses of the synaptic location of glutamate receptors, activity-dependent changes in developing visual neurons, and extensive data on MAGUKs, we propose a model of glutamatergic synaptic differentiation. In this model, different NMDA receptor scaffolding and signaling complexes effect the trafficking and synaptic localization of NR2A-rich and NR2B-rich receptors, leading to tangential compartmentalization of these receptors and their movement between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments.","Despite a rather long migratory journey, interneurons are functional before vertically migrating pyramidal neurons and they constitute the source and target of the first functional synapses in the developing hippocampus. Interneuron-driven network patterns are already present in utero while principal cells are mostly quiescent. At that early stage, GABAergic synapses--which are formed before glutamatergic ones--are excitatory, suggesting that GABA is a pioneer, much like the neurons from which it is released. This review discusses this sequence of events, its functional significance and the role that interneurons might play in the construction of cortical networks.","Appropriate specification of neurotransmitters is a key feature of neuronal network assembly. There is much evidence that genetic programs are responsible for this aspect of cell fate and neuronal differentiation. Are there additional ways in which these processes are shaped? Recent findings demonstrate that altering patterned Ca(2+) spike activity that is spontaneously generated by different classes of embryonic spinal neurons in vivo changes expression of neurotransmitters in a homeostatic manner, as if to achieve a constant level of excitation. Activity-dependent changes in presynaptic transmitter expression pose a matching problem: are there corresponding changes in postsynaptic transmitter receptor expression, or are axons rerouted to novel targets with which functional synapses can be formed?","GABA neurotransmission requires a specialized set of proteins to synthesize, transport or respond to GABA. This article reviews results from a genetic strategy in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans designed to identify the genes responsible for these activities. These studies identified mutations in genes encoding five different proteins: the biosynthetic enzyme for GABA, the vesicular GABA transporter, a transcription factor that determines GABA neuron identity, a classic inhibitory GABA receptor and a novel excitatory GABA receptor. This review discusses the strategy employed to identify these genes as well as the conclusions about GABA transmission derived from study of the mutant phenotypes.","Neurodevelopmental disorders typically have complex endophenotypes, which can include abnormalities in neuronal excitability, processing of complex information, as well as behaviors such as anxiety and social interactions. Converging experimental and clinical evidence suggests that altered interneuron development may underlie part of the pathophysiological process of such disorders. Consistent with this, mice with abnormal hepatocyte growth factor signaling exhibit disturbances in the development of specific interneuron subclasses that are paralleled by seizure activity and a complex behavioral phenotype. Mutations in molecules that regulate different aspects of interneuron development could provide the heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility that, when combined with environmental disturbances, results in a phenotypic spectrum that serves as the hallmark pathophysiology for autism, mental retardation, schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","Real-time imaging of migrating neurons has changed our understanding of how newborn neurons reach their final positions in the developing cerebral cortex. The migratory routes and modes of migration are more diverse and complex than previously thought. The finding that cortical interneurons migrate to the cortex from origins in the ventral telencephalon has already markedly altered our view of cortical migration. More recent findings have demonstrated additional nuances in the migratory pattern and highlighted differences between subsets of interneurons. Moreover, radial migration of pyramidal neurons does not progress smoothly from ventricle to cortical plate, but is instead characterized by distinct migratory phases in which neurons change shape and direction of movement. Integrating these findings with the molecular machinery underlying migration will provide a more complete picture of how the cerebral cortex is assembled.","Roger Sperry proposed 40 years ago that topographic neural connections are established through complementary expression of chemoaffinity labels in projecting neurons and their final targets. This led to the identification of ephrins as key molecular cues controlling the topography of retinotectal projections. Recent studies have revealed a surprising twist to this model, shedding light on the developmental mechanisms patterning the projections between the thalamus and the cortex: ephrins, unexpectedly expressed in an intermediate target, control the establishment of topography of axonal projections between these two structures. The same cues are re-used later to control the mapping of thalamocortical projections within a given cortical area, which strikingly illustrates how a limited set of genes can contribute to generate several levels of complexity of a neuronal network.","Persistent activity-induced synaptic modification is generally regarded as the cellular basis for developmental refinement of neuronal connections and for learning and memory. It has long been recognized that synaptic modifications can be reversed by subsequent stimuli. Recent in vivo studies indicate that reversal of synaptic modifications is a natural process that can be triggered by physiological activity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synapses in adult rats was reversed as rats entered a novel environment. LTP of retinotectal synapses in developing Xenopus was also reversed by subsequent spontaneous activity. Repetitive stimulation with spaced patterns, however, can overcome this reversal, leading to stabilized synaptic modifications. The requirement of spaced stimulus patterns for stable synaptic modifications could ensure appropriate refinement of developing connections.","Many of the diverse functional consequences of activating group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors require translation of pre-existing mRNA near synapses. One of these consequences is long-term depression (LTD) of transmission at hippocampal synapses. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the defect responsible for fragile X syndrome in humans, increases LTD in mouse hippocampus. This finding is consistent with the growing evidence that FMRP normally functions as a repressor of translation of specific mRNAs. Here we present a theory that can account for diverse neurological and psychiatric aspects of fragile X syndrome, based on the assumption that many of the protein-synthesis-dependent functions of metabotropic receptors are exaggerated in fragile X syndrome. The theory suggests new directions for basic research as well as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of humans with fragile X, the most frequent inherited cause of mental retardation and an identified cause of autism.","Identifying gene functions in behaviours has so far relied mainly on achievements in the field of molecular genetics. Further progress can be made by developing new approaches that allow refinement of behavioural phenotypes. The current availability of several thousand different mutant mice challenges behavioural neuroscientists to extend their views and methodologies, to dissect complex behaviours into behavioural phenotypes, and subsequently to define gene-behavioural phenotype relationships. Here, we plead for multi-day automated behavioural observations in carefully designed environments.","A recent study found that the functional organization of auditory cortex was disrupted when rats were exposed to a moderate level of continuous noise during early development. However, this detrimental effect on auditory cortex could be remedied later by stimulating the noise-reared rats with structured sounds. These findings suggest that the endpoint of the ""critical period"" could be extended well into adult life, which has significant implications for our understanding of cortical plasticity.","The surface area of the cerebral cortex has increased massively during mammalian evolution and this change has been accompanied by folding of the cortical sheet into gyri. The molecular mechanisms that control cortical size are poorly understood. A recent study suggests that the regulation of cortical size might involve phospholipids, by showing that their addition to cultured embryonic mouse cortices increases cortical size and induces folds resembling gyri.", ,"During the past several decades, lac permease has assumed almost tutelary proportions as a model for cotransporters. This archetypical membrane protein now exerts its influence by the most dramatic means possible: its structure is solved. This article describes the configuration and implied transport mechanism of the bacterial lactose transporter and compares its structure and function with those of other transporters and those of ion channels. This juxtaposition of transporters and channels is likely to be helpful because LacY is the first cotransporter with known structure and exclusive carrier properties, and it shares topology with neurotransmitter transporters with unknown structure and channel properties.","Mechanosensitive ion channels, which convert external mechanical forces into electrical and chemical signals in cells, are diverse. Presently, there is no known common sequence 'signature' that identifies mechanosensitivity. Bacterial mechanosensitive channels gated by membrane tension represent convenient models allowing us to combine structural information with the insights gained from biophysical analysis, biochemistry, genetic screens, bacterial physiology and molecular computation. Here, the conformational transition driven by membrane tension in the bacterial channel MscL is discussed. The predicted pathway suggests roles for distinct protein domains, surrounding lipids and water in the gating process. MscL, a simple system, thus helps us obtain a coherent picture of molecular events, and build concepts and strategies that can be applied to more elaborate mechanosensory systems in the near future.","In the field of ligand-gated ion channels, recent developments, both in the knowledge of structure and in the measurement of function at the single-channel level, have allowed a sensible start to be made on understanding the relationship between structure and function in these proteins. In this review, the cases of glycine, nicotinic ACh and glutamate receptors are compared and contrasted, and problems such as how binding of agonist causes the channel to open, and why partial agonists are partial, are considered. Some observations, both structural and functional, suggest that more attention needs to be paid to conformational changes that occur before the channel opens. Such changes might account for the interaction found between subunits of the glycine receptor while it is still shut and, perhaps, the agonist-dependent structural changes seen in AMPA receptors. They might also complicate our understanding of the binding-gating problem.","New hypotheses and predictions have arisen from recent work revealing atomic-scale or near-atomic-scale structures of receptors in the 'Cys-loop' superfamily. How general is the cation-pi interaction between the natural ligand and a tryptophan residue in the aromatic box, and does this interaction extend to other ligands? What is the pathway from the binding site to gating, and what are the conformational changes during gating and desensitization? Is current flow through intracellular 'portals' in the wall of the channel a general feature? This article discusses these and related questions, emphasizing nicotinic ACh receptors and also discussing data from other members of this superfamily.","Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate rapid information transfer at most excitatory synapses in the brain. Crystal structures are now available for the ligand-binding domain, but the structure of the ion channel itself remains unknown. The core of the ion channel shares structural features with an inverted K(+) channel. In detail, however, differences are emerging. Most notable in the glutamate receptor ion channel are distinct structural and functional properties of a major pore-lining domain, the requirement of an additional transmembrane segment (M4), and twofold rather than fourfold symmetry. Together with ligand-binding domain structures and kinetic experiments, these findings have started to define the basic principles of channel gating in glutamate receptors.","ClC channels constitute a large family of Cl(-)-selective ion channels that are present in diverse organisms. The channels have a complex gating behavior, in which channel opening and closing is tightly coupled to ion permeation. Recent success in the structure determination of bacterial channels has revealed the overall architecture of this family and provided important insight into ion selectivity and gating. The ClC channels are homodimers, with each subunit containing an ion conduction pore. In the narrow selectivity filter of each pore, Cl(-) are bound to several sites through electrostatic interactions with helix dipoles and the partial charges of protein residues. In the closed conformation of the channel, a conserved glutamate residue occupies one of the ion-binding sites; on channel opening, this glutamate residue moves out of the binding site, thereby making room for an additional Cl(-) ion.","Combined with high-resolution atomic-level crystal structures of channel forming peptides, theory has become a powerful tool for illuminating factors influencing permeation. Here, advantages and limitations of the more familiar continuum and molecular modeling techniques are briefly outlined. These methods are applied to issues of permeation in two different channel families: gramicidin and K(+) channels. Using structural data, theory provides verifiable atomic-level insights into permeation dynamics, channel conductance and molecular selectivity mechanisms. Not only can theory confirm experimental inference, it can also sometimes provide structural perspectives in advance of experiment.","Neurons owe their exquisite electrical excitability to voltage-gated ion channels. By creating and shaping the action potential, these voltage-sensitive proteins supply the neuron with crucial communication skills. A steady stream of experimental results, arising from numerous laboratories and employing a diverse repertoire of techniques, has produced a consensus model of the way voltage-gated ion channels sense and respond to changes in membrane potential. In contrast to this consensus mechanism, recent studies of the voltage-gated K(+) channel KvAP suggest a strikingly different mode of action. In this review, these disparate models are compared and critically discussed.","Ion channels are generally multi-subunit complexes, with the ion conduction pathway formed at the subunit interface. In moving between the closed and open states, three structurally distinct channels, represented by the recently determined structures of a mechanosensitive, ligand-gated and K(+) selective channel, all move transmembrane helices away from the central ion conduction pathway. In all three cases, this results in the displacement of a hydrophobic gate from the ion conduction pathway, freeing ion movement. The channels achieve this by moving the transmembrane helices as rigid bodies using three major types of motion: MscL tilts its helices, the nicotinic ACh receptor rotates its helices, and KirBac1.1 bends its helices. In all cases, the gating motions are likely to take place rapidly. These large and fast movements provide a possible explanation for why the conduction pathways of a wide range of different ion channels are formed at the interface between subunits.","How genes and environment interface to generate major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia has been puzzling, as are the relative roles of neurons and glia in such disturbances. Tomonaga and colleagues have recently reported striking neurobehavioral abnormalities in mice expressing Borna disease virus phosphoprotein (BDV-P) selectively in glial cells. The study provides a novel approach of linking environmental and genetic factors to behavior by producing genetically engineered mice. The key role for glial BDV-P implicates neuron-glia interactions in the pathogenesis of psychiatric conditions.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2004 Sep;27(9):519.,"Nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) plays a crucial role in vascular function and homeostasis. NO possesses vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiproliferative properties. Augmentation of NO production increases cerebral blood flow, which can lead to neuroprotection during brain ischaemia. Several modalities that upregulate eNOS expression and/or activity have recently been identified, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), steroid hormones, nutrients and physical activity. They all increase NO bioavailability, leading to enhanced cerebral blood flow and protection from ischaemic stroke. Thus, therapeutic modalities that target eNOS not only serve as preventive measures to reduce stroke incidence but also could represent novel treatment strategies for reducing brain injury during cerebral ischaemia.","'Forward models' are increasingly recognized as a crucial explanatory concept in vertebrate motor control. The essential idea is that an important function implemented by nervous systems is prediction of the sensory consequences of action. This is often associated with higher cognitive capabilities; however, many of the purposes forward models are thought to have analogues in insect behaviour, and the concept is closely connected to those of 'efference copy' and 'corollary discharge'. This article considers recent evidence from invertebrates that demonstrates the predictive modulation of sensory processes by motor output, and discusses to what extent this supports the conclusion that insect nervous systems also implement forward models. Several promising directions for further research are outlined.","Spillover of dopamine (DA) from a release site into the extrasynaptic space is widely acknowledged. Indeed, spillover is necessary for signalling by DA because its receptors are predominantly extrasynaptic. Dopamine transporters (DATs) are often considered to participate in this process by 'gating' spillover. This article reviews the competition between DATs and diffusion in sculpting extracellular DA transients after quantal release, using a model based on data from the literature. Its conclusions challenge the view that DATs limit synaptic DA concentration and gate initial spillover from a release site; this is the work of diffusion. Rather, the greatest influence of DATs, or of their inhibition, is on the sphere of influence and lifetime of DA beyond a release site and, thus, on net extracellular concentration.","GABAA receptors not only respond to the local release of GABA from presynaptic terminals, but can also mediate a persistent 'tonic current'. This reflects the activation of high-affinity GABAA receptors by ambient GABA concentrations. Tonic GABAA-receptor-mediated signalling occurs in different brain regions, shows cell-type-specific differences in magnitude and pharmacology, and changes during brain development. Some clues to the adaptive significance of this phenomenon are beginning to emerge: in cerebellar granule cells, it alters the gain of transmission of rate-coded sensory information; in the hippocampus, it acts in a cell-type-specific manner to regulate the excitability of the network. Because tonic conductances can be modulated by changes in GABA release and uptake, and by modulators of high-affinity GABAA receptors including neurosteroids, this phenomenon provides a potentially important new window onto neuronal information processing and pathological states such as epilepsy.","Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mutated GFP variants have proved to be immensely powerful tools that have had a profound impact on research in biological sciences. This review considers the development, use and future implications of pH-dependent GFP variants (e.g. pHluorins). These proteins hold considerable promise for the relatively non-invasive monitoring of events such as exocytosis, endocytosis and protein surface expression in living neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution.","To associate events that are disparate in time, the brain must record, retain and perhaps even reflect on the individual events themselves. Aspects of such learning can be probed with trace conditioning, during which an animal learns to associate events that are temporally distant from one another. For decades, we have known that the formation of so-called trace memories (in which one stimulus is associated with a second stimulus that is discontinuous and later in time) depends on the hippocampal formation. Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus is crucial for the initial acquisition of trace memories but not for their expression or long-term storage. More recent findings implicate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and awareness in the formation of trace memories.","Studies on neural networks indicate that the pattern of amnesia that occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be reproduced by synaptic loss, but only when this loss is accompanied by synaptic scaling, a homeostatic mechanism that maintains the level of excitatory input on postsynaptic neurons. It is suggested that increased cholinergic activity during the early stages of AD contributes to synaptic scaling and that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improve cognition in AD patients by boosting this mechanism.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2004 May;27(5):241-2.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2004 May;27(5):243-4.,"Astroglia have long been thought to play merely a supporting role in the life of the neuron. However, these star-shaped cells have recently been the focus of intense study that has begun to emphasize remarkable and novel roles for these amazing cells. While astroglia play positive roles in the life of the neuron, they can simultaneously exert negative influences. Kinouchi et al. convincingly demonstrate and characterize an inhibitory role played by astroglia after neuronal transplantation. These findings remind us that astroglia exert positive and negative influences on neuronal survival, migration, neurite outgrowth and functional integration. Here, we review the complementary and often contradictory roles of astroglia during neuronal integration.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that kills motor neurons. Despite a long disappointing history of human trials with neurotrophins, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Kaspar and colleagues have successfully slowed disease in transgenic ALS mice by forcing motor neurons to produce IGF-1 following retrograde delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) injected into muscle. With the clinical safety of both IGF-1 and AAV already established, this provides real hope for an effective treatment of ALS.","Over the past couple of years, it has become evident that some males carrying the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) premutation, typically viewed to be normal, in fact manifest a neurodegenerative disease with ataxia and tremor. FMR1 premutation alleles uniquely produce FMR1 transcripts with an elongated CGG repeat, leading to the hypothesis that premutant transcripts cause the neurodegenerative disease in carriers. Recently Jin et al. demonstrated, in Drosophila, that FMR1 premutation RNA causes neurodegeneration. These data show RNA can induce neurodegeneration and provide strong evidence that FMR1 RNA mediates the neurodegeneration in human premutation carriers.","The decay time course of excitatory postsynaptic currents generated by slow glutamatergic synapses is determined by the single-channel kinetics of postsynaptic NMDA receptor channels. In a recent study, examination of these single-channel kinetics has revealed that NMDA receptors can enter into modal gating. Linear free-energy analysis suggests that the various modes arise from a common reaction mechanism, providing further insight into the gating underlying decay of the slow synaptic response.","Recent findings by Khodorova et al. demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 plays an important role in certain nociceptive behaviors in an animal model of pain, through activation of sensory neurons. Endothelin-1 might also have the unexpected capacity to release an opioid from surrounding keratinocytes and thereby inhibit the pain response. Such results suggest that, in the periphery, there are important interactions between sensory nerve terminals and surrounding cells, and that glia and keratinocytes could modulate the perception of environmental stimuli to a greater extent than previously considered.","When only a featureless straight contour of a moving object is visible, one cannot tell its true velocity and the object seems to be moving perpendicularly to its orientation. Using psychophysics and brain imaging, Goltz et al. have now demonstrated that this aperture problem also occurs in visual representations in egocentric coordinates. An afterimage of inclined lines that is perceived to move with smooth-pursuit eye movements appears to move perpendicularly to the lines rather than in the tracking direction.","In nerve terminals, endocytosis in compensation for transmitter exocytosis was once thought 'housekeeping'. Now, several lines of research utilizing optical endocytic probes have coalesced into a new functional model. The model comprises two distinct endocytosis and vesicle-processing paradigms that are differentially regulated in response to demand for transmitter. Under some circumstances, such as recovery from short-term depression, it appears that endocytosis, and not exocytosis, is rate-limiting for transmitter release and is therefore a principal determinant of synaptic strength.","Very precise nociceptive skin reflexes that withdraw the skin from a harmful stimulus are formed through an experience-dependent mechanism that develops around two weeks after birth in rodents. Tactile input paves the way for the nociceptive reflex, and nociceptive stimuli are not required for the reflex to be formed. Petersson et al. show that the tactile input produced during muscle twitches occurring during sleep are essential for this process to develop.","The brain processes information about sensory stimuli and motor intentions using a massive ensemble of neurons arrayed in parallel. Individual neurons receive convergent inputs from thousands of other neurons, leading to the possibility that patterns of spikes across the input neurons might be crucial components of the neural code. Recently, advances in multielectrode recording techniques have allowed several laboratories to investigate the nature of the interactions between neurons, and their potential role in information coding. Several recent studies have found that the amount of information coded by correlated activity about sensory and motor variables is small, casting doubt on the hypothesis that correlations between pairs of neurons are important for information coding. However, other studies have documented the appearance of coherent oscillations, during particular task epochs and conditions that require selective processing of sensory information, supporting the hypothesis that coherent oscillations between neurons might reflect the dynamic flow of information in the brain.","The dynamic clamp uses computer simulation to introduce artificial membrane or synaptic conductances into biological neurons and to create hybrid circuits of real and model neurons. In the ten years since it was first developed, the dynamic clamp has become a widely used tool for the study of neural systems at the cellular and circuit levels. This review describes recent state-of-the-art implementations of the dynamic clamp and summarizes insights gained through its use, ranging from the role of voltage-dependent conductances in shaping neuronal activity to the effects of synaptic dynamics on network behavior and the impact of in vivo-like input on neuronal information processing.","Potassium channels are crucial regulators of neuronal excitability, setting resting membrane potentials and firing thresholds, repolarizing action potentials and limiting excitability. Although most of our understanding of K+ channels is based on somatic recordings, there is good evidence that these channels are present in synaptic terminals. In recent years the improved access to presynaptic compartments afforded by direct recording techniques has indicated diverse roles for native K+ channels, from suppression of aberrant firing to action potential repolarization and activity-dependent modulation of synaptic activity. This article reviews the growing evidence for multiple roles and discrete localization of distinct K+ channels at presynaptic terminals.","Many aspects of neuronal activity are regulated by Ca2+ signals. The transduction of temporally and spatially distinct Ca2+ signals requires the action of Ca2+-sensor proteins including various EF-hand-containing Ca2+-binding proteins. The neuronal Ca2+ sensor (NCS) protein family and the related Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) have begun to emerge as key players in neuronal function. Many of these proteins are expressed predominantly or only in neurons, sometimes with cell-specific patterns of expression. Their ability to associate with membranes either constitutively or in response to elevated Ca2+ concentration allows the NCS proteins to discriminate between different spatial and temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals. Recent work has established several physiological roles of these proteins, including diverse actions on gene expression, ion channel function, membrane traffic of ion channels and receptors, and the control of apoptosis.","Like axons, dendrites need guidance for proper orientation and positioning within the brain. Guidance determines synaptic connectivity as well as the strength of transmission. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that several cell-surface receptors, previously known as axon guidance molecules, are also responsible for the directed outgrowth of dendrites. Collectively, these studies reveal that the function of guidance molecules in individual neurons and individual processes is diverse and likely to be specifically regulated. Here, these studies are reviewed and emerging issues and implications are discussed.","The performance of the brain is constrained by wiring length and maintenance costs. The apparently inverse relationship between number of neurons in the various interneuron classes and the spatial extent of their axon trees suggests a mathematically definable organization, reminiscent of 'small-world' or scale-free networks observed in other complex systems. The wiring-economy-based classification of cortical inhibitory interneurons is supported by the distinct physiological patterns of class members in the intact brain. The complex wiring of diverse interneuron classes could represent an economic solution for supporting global synchrony and oscillations at multiple timescales with minimum axon length.","The organization of the cortical auditory system remains controversial. In particular, the extent to which there is regional specialization in the cortical processing of complex sound is unclear. Here, we ask whether we are currently asking the right questions of auditory cortex, or using the appropriate techniques to do so. A key factor that will promote such understanding in the future will be increasing dialogue between workers using electrophysiological recording methods to assess the response properties of single neurons and those using imaging techniques to map regional organization. In the future, further insights will be obtained by efforts to test hypotheses developed on the basis of one approach by the use of the other. Imaging can tell the neurophysiologists where to look, and work on single neurons can constrain network models based on imaging. There is a crucial need for better understanding of the anatomy of the auditory cortex in different species and for comparative studies that will underpin both approaches.","Our understanding of the neural correlates of crossmodal binding in the human brain derives almost exclusively from studies of audition, vision and somatosensation. A new study by Gottfried and Dolan extends our understanding of multisensory integration by showing that facilitation of odor detection by visual cues depends on object congruency, as well as on enhanced activity in the superior temporal sulcus and a region of the orbitofrontal cortex that is adjacent to olfactory association cortex.","Tsao et al. have recently used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare processing for moving stereoscopic forms in macaque and human brains. Most humans exhibited activation in a swath of lateral occipital areas, extending into the intraparietal sulcus, with a limited version of the same pattern in monkeys. However, neither species showed strong activation of the motion area known as MT in monkey or its human homolog.","Colocalization of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and exocytotic sites at the active zones of nerve terminals underlies 'synchronous' action potential discharge and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, thus allowing fast interneuronal signalling. Such a demand for a rapid release is not expected in neuroendocrine cells whose secretory products act throughout the entire organism. Nevertheless, by using evanescent field imaging of near-membrane Ca2+ concentrations and fluorescently labelled vesicles, Becherer et al. have recently reported exocytosis of individual large dense-core vesicles triggered by Ca2+ microdomains formed around clusters of open L-type Ca2+ channels in chromaffin cells from the adrenal medulla. This finding, besides illustrating the power of new microscopy imaging techniques, directly demonstrates in neuroendocrine cells a functional interaction between Ca2+ channels and secretory vesicles very much reminiscent of that in neurons.","The importance of subplate neurons in controlling multiple steps of cortex development was recognized more than a decade ago. However, knowledge of the precise function of subplate neurons in the establishment of cortical circuitry has been missing. A recent study has now started to dissect the functional and molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of transient neuronal circuitry in the visual cortex.","Patterns of neural firing linked to eye movement decisions show that behavioral decisions are predicted by the differential firing rates of cells coding selected and nonselected stimulus alternatives. These results can be interpreted using models developed in mathematical psychology to model behavioral decisions. Current models assume that decisions are made by accumulating noisy stimulus information until sufficient information for a response is obtained. Here, the models, and the techniques used to test them against response-time distribution and accuracy data, are described. Such models provide a quantitative link between the time-course of behavioral decisions and the growth of stimulus information in neural firing data.","Stroke represents a major health problem in the ever-ageing population of industrialized nations. Each year, over three million people in the USA alone suffer from this affliction. Stroke, which results from the obstruction of an intra- or extra-cerebral artery, induces irreversible neuronal damage. The clot-busting drug tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved therapy for acute stroke. Although tPA has been successfully used to treat myocardial infarction due to clot formation, its use in the treatment of occlusive cerebrovascular diseases remains controversial. Indeed, tPA is clearly beneficial as a thrombolytic agent. However, increasing evidence suggests that tPA could have direct and deleterious effects on neurons and glial cells.","Elucidation of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying neoplasia is one of the great success stories of modern science, but this success has not been associated with parallel improvements in the treatment of malignant tumors. One possible explanation for this failure is that the most important variables that support growth of malignancies are not yet identified. Another possible explanation, however, is that multiple variables important in neoplastic progression combine to create a level of disease complexity not taken into account by current therapeutic approaches. The study of development and neoplasia in the CNS provides some of the strongest support for the latter view--a view that, if correct, would suggest that a radical rethinking of the biology of malignancy is required if we are to make progress in the treatment of this important medical condition.","Recent work has shown that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) growth factors regulate development of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Drosophila. Intriguingly, the same BMP growth factors also influence the expression of circulating hormones that modulate the physiological properties of NMJs. Together, the results suggest that retrograde growth factor signaling by BMPs integrates neuromuscular development and function at both local and global levels in the animal.","Interneurons are often classified according to neuropeptide content. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that neuropeptides are more than convenient neurochemical markers and can act as important modulators of neuronal activity. Recent advances in understanding neuropeptide release and physiological actions suggest that the interneuronal system of neuropeptides is crucial for maintaining appropriate brain function under normal and pathophysiological conditions. In particular, interneuronal neuropeptides appear to play roles in cognition and as endogenous anti-epileptic agents. This article describes current understanding of the conditions under which neuropeptides are released from interneurons, their specific effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, and the consequences of their loss of function.","Intracytoplasmic filamentous aggregates, such as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, are composed of the proteins tau and alpha-synuclein, respectively. These pathological inclusions are linked directly to the etiology and mechanisms of disease in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, termed 'tauopathies' and 'synucleinopathies'. Emerging evidence indicates that there is frequent overlap of the pathological and clinical features of patients with tauopathies and synucleinopathies, thereby re-enforcing the notion that these disorders might be linked mechanistically. Indeed, several lines of investigation suggest that tau and alpha-synuclein might constitute a unique class of unstructured proteins that assemble predominantly into homopolymeric (rather than heteropolymeric) fibrils, which deposit mainly in separate amyloid inclusions, but occasionally deposit together. Thus, the ability of tau and alpha-synuclein to affect each other directly or indirectly might contribute to the overlap in the clinical and pathological features of tauopathies and synucleinopathies.", ,Baker et al. have recently studied the potential role of cocaine-induced alterations in accumbens cystine-glutamate transporter activity (which controls basal extracellular glutamate levels) during cocaine-induced relapse to drug seeking in rats. Their data provide new evidence that neuroadaptations induced by repeated exposure to cocaine and subsequent withdrawal can play a causal role in drug relapse. These data also suggest the cystine-glutamate transporter as a novel target for medication that could prevent cocaine relapse.,"In a recent paper, Shawn Green and Daphne Bavelier show that playing an action video game markedly improved subjects performance on a range of visual skills related to detecting objects in briefly flashed displays. This is noteworthy as previous studies on perceptual learning, which have commonly focused on well-controlled and rather abstract tasks, found little transfer of learning to novel stimuli, let alone to different tasks. The data suggest that video game playing modifies visual processing on different levels: some effects are compatible with increased attentional resources, whereas others point to changes in preattentive processing.","Hebbian synaptic learning requires co-activation of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. However, under some conditions, information regarding the postsynaptic action potential, carried by backpropagating action potentials, can be strongly degraded before it reaches the distal exhibit Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP)? Recent results show that LTP can indeed occur at synapses on distal dendrites of hippocamal CA1 neurons, even in the absence of a postsynaptic somatic spike. Instead. local dendritic spikes contribute to the depolarization required to induce LTP. Here, a dendritically constrained synaptic learning rule is proposed, which suggests that nearby synapses can encode temporally contiguous events.","A common histopathological hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases is the presence of aberrant proteinaceous inclusions inside affected neurons. Because these protein aggregates are detected using antibodies against components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), impairment of this machinery for regulated proteolysis has been suggested to be at the root of Neurodegeneration. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove in vivo owing to the lack of appropriate tools. The recent report of transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of UPS-reporter protein should finally make it possible to test in vivo the role of the UPS in neurodegeneration.","How synapses change their strength in response to impinging neural activity is a fundamental issue for understanding how the brain molds its circuitry in response to behavioral experience. Although a growing number of studies reveal the involvement of postsynaptic changes contributing to synaptic plasticity in brain circuits, the involvement of presynaptic factors has been implied by several studies. Most recently, several works point to the mechanism of vesicle fusion as a new possible locus for the modification of presynaptic synaptic strength. However, it is not yet clear to what extent such changes affect the simplest form of information transfer in the brain--the transmission of a single action potential.","During development, when barriers between the central and peripheral nervous systems are less tight than at adult stages, it is important that each retains its integrity. A recent article provides evidence that complex mechanisms prevent cellular mixing during this period and reveals an unexpected ability of postmitotic neurons to migrate along their own axons.","The shapes of the head and ears of mammals are asymmetrical top-to-bottom and front-to-back. Reflections of sounds from these structures differ with the angle of incidence, producing cues for monaural sound localization in the spectra of the stimuli at the eardrum. Neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) respond specifically to spectral cues and integrate them with somatosensory, vestibular and higher-level auditory information through parallel fiber inputs in a cerebellum-like circuit. Synapses between parallel fibers and their targets show long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), whereas those between auditory nerve fibers and their targets do not. This paper discusses the integration of acoustic and the proprioceptive information in terms of possible computational roles for the DCN.","Exocytotic release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate depends on transport of this amino acid into synaptic vesicles. Recent work has identified a distinct family of proteins responsible for vesicular glutamate transport (VGLUTs) that show no sequence similarity to the other two families of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. The distribution of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 accounts for the ability of most established excitatory neurons to release glutamate by exocytosis. Surprisingly, they show a striking complementary pattern of expression in adult brain that might reflect differences in membrane trafficking. By contrast, VGLUT3 is expressed by many cells traditionally considered to release a different classical transmitter, suggesting novel roles for glutamate as an extracellular signal. VGLUT3 also differs from VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in its subcellular location, with somatodendritic as well as axonal expression.","Structural and functional diversity of GABAergic interneurons has become increasingly central in our understanding of the elemental steps of information processing in the brain. The use of different molecular, electrophysiological and anatomical techniques has provided a wealth of new information regarding GABAergic interneurons over the past decade but it has also led to confusion regarding the number of subtypes of GABAergic interneurons. Combinatorial approaches that also consider multiple parameters seem now to offer renewed hope for finally clarifying the structural diversity of GABAergic interneurons. New molecular techniques have become a powerful tool for exposing the functional diversity of GABAergic neurons at the cellular, microcircuit and systems levels. This article reviews literature regarding molecular tools that have been used, or that appear promising for future attempts, to classify GABAergic interneurons. Some important limitations will also be indicated.","Ordinary vision is considered a binding success: all the pieces and aspects of an image are bound together, despite being processed by many different neurons in several different cortical areas. How this is accomplished is a key problem in visual neuroscience. The study of visual binding might be facilitated if we had ways to induce binding failures. A particularly interesting failure would involve a loss of the physical integrity of the image. Here, we identify conditions that induce such perceptual failures (e.g. the melting together of equiluminant colored images and the fragmentation of retinally stabilized images) and we suggest that these should studied using electrophysiological measures of binding.","Dendritic spines mediate most excitatory inputs in the brain, yet their function is still unclear. Imaging experiments have demonstrated their role in biochemical compartmentalization at individual synapses, yet theoretical studies have suggested that they could serve an electrical function in transforming synaptic inputs and transmitting dendritic spikes. Recent data indicate that spines possess voltage-dependent conductances and that these channels can be spine-specific. Although direct experimental investigations of the electrical properties of spines have not yet taken place, spines could play a significant electrical role, greatly influencing dendritic integration and the function of neural circuits.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.011 PMID: 14698611  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.11.003 PMID: 14698610  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.013 PMID: 14698609  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.010 PMID: 14698608  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.012 PMID: 14698607  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.11.001 PMID: 14698606  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE], ,DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.014 PMID: 14698603  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.007 PMID: 14698601  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.015 PMID: 14698600  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,"Synaptic plasticity is fundamental to many neurobiological functions, including memory and pain. Central sensitization refers to the increased synaptic efficacy established in somatosensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following intense peripheral noxious stimuli, tissue injury or nerve damage. This heightened synaptic transmission leads to a reduction in pain threshold, an amplification of pain responses and a spread of pain sensitivity to non-injured areas. In the cortex, LTP - a long-lasting highly localized increase in synaptic strength - is a synaptic substrate for memory and learning. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of central sensitization and LTP indicates that, although there are differences between the synaptic plasticity contributing to memory and pain, there are also striking similarities.","Dendrites contain voltage-sensitive conductances that, in vivo, can be influenced by neuromodulatory inputs. In spinal motoneurons, dendrites have voltage-activated persistent inward currents that are facilitated by neuromodulatory input from monoaminergic axons originating in the brainstem. The highest levels of monoamine input are likely to occur during 'fight or flight' behavioral situations. At these high levels, the persistent currents are so large that the dendrites of motoneurons become hyperexcitable, enhancing ionotropic inputs by fivefold or more and allowing the firing rates required for maximal activation of muscle fibers to be generated by surprisingly small inputs. Moderate dendritic excitability (twofold to threefold enhancement) is likely to be a standard component of many normal motor behaviors, such as locomotion. Thus, during normal motor behavior, synaptic integration might be dominated by active currents intrinsic to the dendritic tree rather than by the synaptic current entering via ionotropic channels.","A key step in the release of neurotransmitter is the entry of Ca(2+) into the presynaptic terminal via voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. N-type and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels play a predominant role but, surprisingly, their distribution across presynaptic terminals lacks any apparent order. They form a patchwork: at some terminals only N-type channels contribute to transmitter release and in others only P/Q-type channels contribute, but in many terminals both sub-types are active. The physiological implications of this non-uniform distribution are starting to emerge. Recent studies reveal that G-protein-mediated depression of N-type channels is stronger than that of P/Q-type channels, whereas voltage-dependent relief of inhibition is more pronounced for P/Q-type channels. The patchwork distribution of Ca(2+) channel subtypes might therefore enable terminal-specific modulation of transmitter release, enhancing the power of synaptic processing.","In vitro models of rhythms of cognitive relevance, such as gamma (30-80 Hz) and theta (5-12 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus, demonstrate an absolute requirement for phasic inhibitory synaptic transmission. Such rhythms can occur transiently, of approximately 1 s duration, or persistently, lasting for many hours. In the latter case, stable patterns of interneuron output, and their postsynaptic consequences for pyramidal cell membrane potential, occur despite known constraints of synaptic habituation and potentiation. This review concentrates on recent in vitro evidence revealing a division of labour among different subclasses of interneurons with respect to the frequency of persistent rhythms, and the crucial dependence on gap-junction-mediated intercellular communication for the generation and maintenance of these rhythms.","Conscious perception, like the sight of a coffee cup, seems to involve the brain identifying a stimulus. But conscious input activates more brain regions than are needed to identify coffee cups and faces. It spreads beyond sensory cortex to frontoparietal association areas, which do not serve stimulus identification as such. What is the role of those regions? Parietal cortex support the 'first person perspective' on the visual world, unconsciously framing the visual object stream. Some prefrontal areas select and interpret conscious events for executive control. Such functions can be viewed as properties of the subject, rather than the object, of experience - the 'observing self' that appears to be needed to maintain the conscious state.","Until recently, learning and memory in invertebrate organisms was believed to be mediated by relatively simple presynaptic mechanisms. By contrast, learning and memory in vertebrate organisms is generally thought to be mediated, at least in part, by postsynaptic mechanisms. But new experimental evidence from research using a model invertebrate organism, the marine snail Aplysia, indicates that this apparent distinction between invertebrate and vertebrate synaptic mechanisms of learning is invalid: learning in Aplysia cannot be explained in terms of exclusively presynaptic mechanisms. NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP appears to be necessary for classical conditioning in Aplysia. Furthermore, modulation of trafficking of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors underlies behavioral sensitization in this snail. Exclusively presynaptic processes appear to support only relatively brief memory in Aplysia. More persistent memory is likely to be mediated by postsynaptic processes, or by presynaptic processes whose expression depends upon retrograde signals.","The interface between so-called activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms of circuit development is discussed here in light of recent findings that question the role of activity in brain development. This debate is presented simplistically here in terms of Sperry's chemoaffinity hypothesis versus Hebb's rules of correlation-based synaptic change, which are often presented as being mutually exclusive - much like oil and vinegar.",DOI: 10.1016/j.tins.2003.10.004 PMID: 14624848  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"The circadian clock in mammals is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus. At the core of the clock are molecular autofeedback loops associated with clock gene transcription. However, the mechanisms of circadian signal transduction are basically unknown. A recent report by Ikeda et al. provides new insights into the intracellular signaling pathways involved in conveying circadian clock information from the core loop to cellular functions. Cytosolic Ca(2+) is proposed to be a key substance linking the 'pendulum' to the 'hands' of the clock.","The vomeronasal organ of the accessory olfactory system detects pheromones in several vertebrate species. Recent studies of vomeronasal sensory neurons have shown that they express MHC molecules, which in the immune system help to discriminate self antigens from non-self antigens. These new findings, along with past research demonstrating MHC-based olfactory discrimination, suggest the exciting possibility that MHC molecules together with vomeronasal G-protein-coupled receptors play a role in distinguishing related individuals from unrelated ones based on pheromonal cues.","Emily Dickinson declared: 'After great pain, a formal feeling comes'. This formal feeling begins when sensory neurons are activated by noxious stimuli, such as stepping on a tack. Recently, Seymour Benzer's group identified sensory neurons in Drosophila larvae that mediate aversive responses to noxious heat and mechanical stimuli. Thresholds for behavioral and nerve responses are elevated by mutations in the painless gene, which encodes a TRP ion channel protein. Painless thus joins an elite group of TRPs implicated in sensory transduction in insects, nematodes, mammals and fish.",Netrin-1 is an attractive axon guidance molecule required for the proper navigation of commissural axons to the floor plate in the spinal cord. A new study now shows that sonic hedgehog (Shh) from midline structures collaborates with netrin-1 to guide commissural axons. This new role for the morphogen Shh raises the possibility that principles similar to those used to establish positional information in embryonic patterning are also employed during axon navigation.,"Feedforward inhibitory circuits are involved both in the suppression of excitability and timing of action potential generation in principal cells. In the CA3 hippocampus, a single mossy fiber from a dentate gyrus granule cell forms giant boutons with multiple release sites, which are capable of detonating CA3 principal cells. By contrast, mossy fiber terminals form a larger number of Lilliputian-sized synapses with few release sites onto local circuit interneurons, with distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic properties. This dichotomy between the two synapse types endows the circuit with exquisite control over pyramidal cell discharge. Under pathological conditions where feedforward inhibition is compromised, focal excitation is no longer contained, rendering the circuit susceptible to hyperexcitability.","Tyrosine kinases were first characterized in terms of their function during development. Over the past decade, it has become clear that tyrosine phosphorylation also plays an important role in the adult mammalian nervous system. This article reviews three different families of tyrosine kinase signaling cascades: the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. Each of these cascades has been implicated in both adult synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Evidence from invertebrate systems also demonstrates a role for tyrosine kinase signaling in the induction of long-term memory, suggesting that molecular mechanisms of memory formation are conserved across species.","Recent studies have highlighted novel functions of a group of cell adhesion molecules during nervous system development. Members of this protein family are characterized by an extracellular domain with sequence homology to cholinesterases and include the neuroligins, synaptic cell adhesion molecules recently implicated in autism, and neurotactin, a cell surface receptor involved in axonal pathfinding. Although these proteins have a structural organization similar to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, the cholinesterase domain lacks enzymatic activity and functions as a protein-protein interaction motif. This protein family provides a striking example of how the function of a catalytically active domain has evolved to mediate receptor-ligand interactions that regulate morphogenetic processes during development of the nervous system.","Gap junctions are clusters of aqueous channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. Each cell contributes a hemichannel, or connexon, to each cell-cell channel. The cell-cell channels are permeable to relatively large molecules, and it was thought that opening of hemichannels to the extracellular space would kill cells through loss of metabolites, collapse of ionic gradients and influx of Ca(2+). Recent findings indicate that specific non-junctional hemichannels do open under both physiological and pathological conditions, and that opening is functional or deleterious depending on the situation. Most of these studies utilized cells in tissue culture that expressed a specific gap junction protein, connexin 43. Several such examples are reviewed here, with a particular focus on astrocytes.","The term neuropeptide was advanced by de Wied and collaborators in the early seventies. At that time, they defined neuropeptides as endogenous substances synthesized in nerve cells and involved in nervous system functions. Since then, several studies have revealed that the very same 'neuropeptides' are also expressed in non-neuronal cells. It is therefore generally accepted that the original definition of these peptides was too limited and, consequently, it has recently been revised. Among the non-neuronal cells that synthesize neuropeptides are several glial cell types.","Like a newly popular nightspot, the biology of adult stem cells has emerged from obscurity to become one of the most lively new disciplines of the decade. The neurosciences have not escaped this trendy pastime and, from amid the noise and excitement, the astrocyte emerges as a beguiling companion to the adult neural stem cell. A once receding partner to neurons and oligodendrocytes, the astrocyte even takes on an alter ego of the stem cell itself (S. Goldman, this issue of TINS). Putting ego aside, the 'astrocyte' is also (and perhaps more importantly) an integral component of neural progenitor hotspots, where the craziness or 'la vida loca' of the nightlife might not be so wild when compared with our traditional understanding of the astrocyte. Here, astrocytes contribute to the instructive confluence of location, atmosphere and cellular neighbors that define the daily 'vida local' or everyday local life of an adult stem cell. This review discusses astrocytes as influential components in the local stem cell niche.","Recent studies have substantially expanded our conception of the roles for glia in function and maintenance of the adult nervous system. Of these reports, several have re-examined the lineage relationships among neural stem cells, their early radial glial derivatives and their mitotically competent neurogenic daughters. These studies have highlighted the role of radial cells in development, and of their glial progeny postnatally, as both progenitors and regulators of neuronal production and phenotype. In the adult mammalian brain, radial cell populations are scant, but their glial derivatives participate in a gliovascular network that organizes not only the structural and functional architecture of the brain but also its generative niches for resident progenitors - glial as well as neuronal. As in other organs, these progenitors can reside as transit-amplifying pools, by which lineage-biased progenitors expand to replenish discrete mature phenotypes. This review will consider the types of transit-amplifying progenitor cells persistent in the adult mammalian CNS, and the extent to which these derive from glial phenotypes. It will also discuss the interactions of progenitor cells with their brethren that could specify their phenotype and fate, while defining the permissive niches for cell genesis in the adult CNS.","What are the functions of the parietal and prefrontal cortices and how do these regions interact to achieve their objectives? How does context change plans for action? Are 'visual' and 'motor' well-defined attributes of neuronal activity in the association cortex? Recent studies of the saccadic system in monkeys have revealed two sets of paradoxical data: in parietal cortex, activity has visual timing but motor direction; in prefrontal cortex, activity has motor timing but visual direction. Analyzing the prefrontal and parietal data together leads to surprising insights. It appears that these paradoxical activities are intermediates in a parietal-prefrontal-parietal loop that has a rapid turnaround, and that a possibly prefrontal context-contingent signal switches sensorimotor transformations in parietal cortex.","Neuromelanin accumulates in dopaminergic neurons during normal aging, and in Parkinson's disease, neurons with this pigment are those that selectively degenerate. Intraneuronal neuromelanin could play a protective role during its synthesis by preventing the toxic accumulation of cytosolic catechol derivatives and, in addition, by its ability to scavenge reactive metals, pesticides and other toxins to form stable adducts. However, dying neurons in Parkinson's disease that release neuromelanin might induce a vicious cycle of chronic neuroinflammation and neuronal loss.","Temperature is one of our most important physical cues, with extremes eliciting painful sensory warnings of tissue damage. Two recent publications present findings in Drosophila that implicate different neural substrates for low- and high-temperature responses, as well as indicating that a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member, painless, plays a role in these responses.","Recent developments in confocal imaging techniques have opened new avenues for investigating how synaptic networks evolve over time. These studies have revealed not only that synaptic structures are motile but also, most importantly, that a fraction of synapses undergo a continuous elimination and formation process, and that these mechanisms are markedly enhanced by activity. Turnover of dendritic spines was recently demonstrated in the somatosensory cortex upon sensory stimulation. De Paola et al. have now provided evidence for correlated remodelling of presynaptic structures. These results, together with others, indicate that activation of neuronal networks enhances dynamic mechanisms at both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic level, resulting in an increased turnover of synapses and, accordingly, a reorganization of synaptic circuitry.","The nervous system is made up of many specific types of neuron intricately intertwined to form complex networks. Identifying and defining the characteristic features of the many different neuronal types is essential for achieving a cellular understanding of complex activity from perception to cognition. So far, cortical GABAergic interneurons have represented the epitome of cellular diversity in the CNS. Despite the desperate need for effective classification criteria allowing a common language among neuroscientists, interneurons still evoke memories of Babel. Several approaches are now available to overcome the challenges and problems associated with the various classification systems used so far.","GeneChip microarrays have recently been introduced to the field of neurobiology to identify and monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. This powerful technique is now used for studying the pathophysiology of CNS injuries including spinal cord lesions. Early stages after injury are characterized by the strong upregulation of genes involved in transcription and inflammation and a general downregulation of structural proteins and proteins involved in neurotransmission. Later, an increase in the expression of growth factors, axonal guidance factors, extracellular matrix molecules and angiogenic factors reflects the attempts for repair, while upregulation of stress genes and proteases and downregulation of cytoskeletal and synaptic mRNA reflect the struggle of the tissue to survive. DNA microarrays have the potential to aid discovery of new targets for neuroprotective or restorative therapeutic approaches","Concepts regarding the function of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) in shaping the excitability of single cells and neuronal ensembles have been evolving rapidly following the recent cloning of genes that encode the underlying 'h-channels' - the HCN genes. This article reviews new information about the transcriptional regulation of these channels, highlighting novel studies that demonstrate short- and long-term modulation of HCN expression, and linking this modulation to mechanisms of neurological diseases.","The malignant transformation of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or their progenitor cells gives rise to tumors that are collectively called gliomas. Although the vast majority of these tumors are believed to be of astrocytic origin, the actual cell of origin remains unknown. And whereas gliomas present with some genetic alterations in tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes that are common among cancers, their biology differs significantly from other neoplasms. Most notably, they grow in a confined space defined by the bones of the skull and spinal column, and they spread by active cell migration rather than by passive, humorous spread. Recent research suggests that astrocyte-derived tumors co-opt neurotransmitters, their transporters and ion channels to support their unusual growth and invasive migration.","Abstract Although glia often envelop synapses, they have traditionally been viewed as passive participants in synaptic function. Recent evidence has demonstrated, however, that there is a dynamic two-way communication between glia and neurons at the synapse. Neurotransmitters released from presynaptic neurons evoke Ca2+ concentration increases in adjacent glia. Activated glia, in turn, release transmitters, including glutamate and ATP. These gliotransmitters feed back onto the presynaptic terminal either to enhance or to depress further release of neurotransmitter. Transmitters released from glia can also directly stimulate postsynaptic neurons, producing either excitatory or inhibitory responses. Based on these new findings, glia should be considered an active partner at the synapse, dynamically regulating synaptic transmission.","The notion that astrocytes have a profound influence on the function of synapses between CNS neurons implies that the development of synaptic connections and their glial neighbors are controlled by reciprocally acting signals. Currently, however, synaptogenesis is considered a purely neuronal affair. This article summarizes recent experimental evidence suggesting that this may not be the case. Astrocytes may indeed regulate the formation, maturation and maintenance of synapses. The recent advances caution that synapses cannot develop correctly without astrocytes. Further progress on this issue requires new experimental models to identify signaling pathways and to scrutinize the relevance of glia-synapse interactions in vivo.","Astrocytes have traditionally been considered ancillary, satellite cells of the nervous system. However, work over the past decade has revealed that they interact with the vasculature to form a gliovascular network that might organize not only the structural architecture of the brain but also its communication pathways, activation, thresholds and plasticity. The net effect is that astroglia demarcate gray matter regions, both cortical and subcortical, into functional compartments whose internal activation thresholds and external outputs are regulated by single glial cells. The array of these astrocyte-delimited microdomains along the capillary microvasculature allows the formation of higher-order gliovascular units, which serve to match local neural activity and blood flow while regulating neuronal firing thresholds through coordinative glial signaling. By these means, astrocytes might establish the functional as well as the structural architecture of the adult brain.","Astrocytes have been presumed to be uninteresting for the better part of a century. Recent findings suggest unexpected new functions for these cells and highlight the importance of viewing most brain activities as a collaboration between astrocytes and neurons. Astrocytes have been implicated in dynamic regulation of neuron production, synaptic network formation, neuron electrical activity and specific neurological diseases. We are only at the threshold of understanding fully the nature and consequences of these new astrocyte functions, and there is still much to be learned about the older and better-known roles. But now, at last, astrocytes have our attention.","Alpha-Synuclein is a core component of the proteinaceous aggregates observed in several neurodegenerative diseases. A central role of alpha-synuclein in neurodegeneration was demonstrated by the discovery of missense alpha-synuclein mutations in familial Parkinson's disease. However, the specific mechanism by which alpha-synuclein contributes to these diseases remains unclear. A recent study by Sharon et al. linked the presence of specific fatty acids to the appearance of alpha-synuclein oligomers in vivo. alpha-Synuclein oligomers might be a first step in the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates present in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, although their cytotoxicity remains to be directly demonstrated.","The 3D orientation of a surface can be specified by perspective, motion parallax or binocular disparity. Tsutsui et al. have found cells in the monkey intraparietal sulcus that responded to surface orientation defined only by a texture gradient. Most of these cells also responded to orientation defined only by binocular disparity.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci. 2003 Nov;26(11):581.,"Odors elicit a well-organized pattern of activation in glomeruli across the surface of the olfactory bulb. However, the mechanisms by which this map is transformed into an odor code by the bulb circuitry remain unclear. Recent physiological studies in bulb slices have identified several synaptic processes that could be involved in sharpening odorant signals. Mitral cells within a single odorant receptor-specific network can be synchronized by dendrodendritic excitatory interactions in a glomerulus, whereas mitral cells in different networks engage in long-lasting lateral inhibition mediated by dendrodendritic synapses with interneurons. The emerging picture is one in which groups of mitral cells use a unique set of mechanisms to accomplish computational functions similar to those performed by analogous modular structures in other sensory systems.","The discovery of proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) in the nervous system has led to new insights about the potential physiological functions of these enzymes, which were traditionally considered merely as degradative molecules. This review summarizes evidence that proteinases, through activation of PARs, interact with the peripheral nervous system (PNS), playing roles in neurogenic inflammation, pain perception, secretory and motor functions, as well as in the response to nerve injuries. Activation of PARs interferes with numerous physiological events that are under tight neural control, in addition to modulating nerve survival. New potential roles are suggested for members of the PAR family, highlighting proteinases and their receptors as potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with PNS activation.","GABAergic interneurons innervating the perisomatic region of pyramidal cells control population discharge patterns, and thereby all cognitive operations in the cerebral cortex. A striking dichotomy in the function of this interneuron population seems to emerge from the synthesis of recent molecular, anatomical and electrophysiological data. Synaptically and electrically coupled networks of parvalbumin-containing basket cells operate as a non-plastic, precision clockwork for gamma and theta oscillations, and are indispensable for basic cortical processing. By contrast, a highly modifiable interneuron syncytium containing cholecystokinin carries information from subcortical pathways about the emotional, motivational and general physiological state of the animal, and appears to be involved in the fine-tuning of network cooperativity. Impairment of this inhibitory mechanism is likely to result in mood disorders such as anxiety.","The field of interneuron research has come of age. An influx of new data has shed light on many areas, but has also highlighted major challenges. The articles in this review series will address several of these challenges, including developing a standardized classification scheme, defining how the integrative properties of interneurons shape their functional roles (including the generation of oscillatory activity), and identifying molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. New technologies can help us address these problems in ways not previously possible. To coordinate the vast amount of data being generated, we propose the creation of a world-wide-web Interneuron Database that will facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons and collaborative studies. A well-crafted database has the potential to bring new insight by standardizing and organizing data collected in physiological, anatomical and molecular studies.","Acid-sensing ionic channels (ASICs) are almost ubiquitous in the mammalian nervous system, both at the periphery and in the brain. Strong evidence for the physiological function of these molecules has come from recent knockout experiments. Now it is clear that ASICs are important for certain sensory modalities (mechanoreception and nociception) at the periphery and for learning and memory in the brain. The actual mechanisms by which the acid-gated channels serve these functions remain unclear. The question of whether tissue pH is subject to quick fluctuations of a magnitude sufficient to activate ASICs is a crucial point that will determine the functional significance of these channels.","The prosomeric model attributes morphological meaning to gene expression patterns and other data in the forebrain. It divides this territory into the same transverse segments (prosomeres) and longitudinal zones in all vertebrates. The axis and longitudinal zones of this model are widely accepted but controversy subsists about the number of prosomeres and their nature as segments. We describe difficulties encountered in establishing continuity between prosomeric limits postulated in the hypothalamus and intra-telencephalic limits. Such difficulties throw doubt on the intersegmental nature of these limits. We sketch a simplified model, in which the secondary prosencephalon (telencephalon plus hypothalamus) is a complex protosegment not subdivided into prosomeres, which exhibits patterning singularities. By contrast, we continue to postulate that prosomeres p1-p3 (i.e. the pretectum, thalamus and prethalamus) are the caudal forebrain.", ,"Mammals regulate their behavior using odor cues called pheromones. These compounds are detected and recognized by neurons in the accessory olfactory system. New electrophysiological recordings in behaving mice by Luo, Fee and Katz reveal aspects of pheromone biology and how these stimuli are represented by single neurons.","Modulation of the proteases that process the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a major therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The discovery of a novel endogenous modulator of alpha-secretase-mediated, in preference to beta-secretase-mediated, cleavage of APP implicates sumoylation in the etiology of AD, and offers a new therapeutic target for intervention in APP processing.","A subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells transduce information about ambient lighting conditions to areas of the brain involved in tasks including entrainment of the circadian clock, pupillary light reflexes and melatonin synthesis. The phototransduction system(s) utilized by these cells are unknown. Melanopsin and cryptochromes have been proposed as candidate photopigments for this system. Recent analyses of retinal degenerate mice lacking melanopsin or cryptochromes indicates that outer and inner photoreceptors can both contribute to non-visual photoresponses, and that both melanopsin and cryptochromes play important roles in this process.","Inhibitory and excitatory connections are equal partners in determining neuronal response properties. Although the development and plasticity of excitatory networks have been heavily studied, little is known about how inhibitory circuits develop. In a recent study, Gunsoo Kim and Karl Kandler have shown that, as in the development of excitatory circuits, synapse elimination and strengthening are important processes for the development of well-organized inhibitory circuits.","Neural tube closure fails in both mouse and Xenopus when dishevelled and other components of the planar-cell-polarity pathway are misregulated. The underlying defect involves a failure of convergent extension in the midline of the early neural plate. Although bilateral neural folds form, they are abnormally far apart and cannot achieve the apposition necessary for neural tube closure.","There is now substantial evidence, from single-cell imaging, that complex patterns of release from Ca(2+) stores play an important role in regulating synaptic efficacy and plasticity. Moreover, the major mechanism of store release depends on the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)] through the action of phospholipase(s) C on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)], and several neurotransmitters can enhance receptor-mediated activation of this enzyme. The recent development of techniques to image real-time changes in PtdIns(4,5)P(2) hydrolysis according to generation of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and diacylglycerol in single cells has significantly advanced our ability to investigate these signalling pathways, particularly in relation to single-cell Ca(2+) signals. This article reviews these new approaches and how they have provided novel insights into mechanisms underlying spatio-temporal Ca(2+) signals and phospholipase C activation in neurons.","Theories about basal ganglia function have always been driven by our knowledge about the spiny projection neurons of the striatum. At the core of these theories lies the question of how, precisely, spiny projection neurons process cortical inputs. Most recently, studies demonstrating the role of spiny projection neurons in local synaptic GABA transmission have provided several new avenues for exploring striatal dynamics. They have also suggested new experimental directives for examining the specific ways in which spiny projection neurons both compete and cooperate through their local axon collaterals during cortical input processing.","Since the middle of the 19th century it has been recognized that several higher cognitive functions, including language, are lateralized in cerebral cortex. Neuropsychological studies on patients with brain lesions and rapid developments in brain imaging techniques have provided us with an increasing body of data on the functional aspects of language lateralization, but little is known about the substrate on which these specializations are realized. Much attention has been focused on the gross size and shape of cortical regions involved, but recent findings indicate that the columnar and connectional structure within auditory and language cortex in the left hemisphere are distinct from those in homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. These findings concern parameters that are closely linked to the processing architecture within the respective regions. Thus, the comparison of these microanatomical specializations with their respective functional counterparts provides important insights into the functional role of cerebral cortical organization and its consequences for processing of cortical information in the implementation of complex cognitive functions.","Theories of dopamine function are at a crossroads. Computational models derived from single-unit recordings capture changes in dopaminergic neuron firing rate as a prediction error signal. These models employ the prediction error signal in two roles: learning to predict future rewarding events and biasing action choice. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or lesion of dopaminergic neuron function diminishes the ability of an animal to motivate behaviors directed at acquiring rewards. These lesion experiments have raised the possibility that dopamine release encodes a measure of the incentive value of a contemplated behavioral act. The most complete psychological idea that captures this notion frames the dopamine signal as carrying 'incentive salience'. On the surface, these two competing accounts of dopamine function seem incommensurate. To the contrary, we demonstrate that both of these functions can be captured in a single computational model of the involvement of dopamine in reward prediction for the purpose of reward seeking.","The discovery that Ca(2+) triggers rapid neurotransmitter release has prompted the search for the Ca(2+) sensor. There is now general agreement that the vesicle-associated Ca(2+)-binding protein, synaptotagmin I, is required for the tight temporal coupling between Ca(2+) influx and synaptic vesicle fusion. However, the precise mechanism of Ca(2+)-sensing by synaptotagmin I is still under debate despite intensive investigation using genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological tools. Here, we discuss many of the genetic manipulations from the past few years that have shed light on the Ca(2+)-sensing function of synaptotagmin I. We also present our view as to how the Ca(2+) signal is translated rapidly into membrane fusion at fast chemical synapses.", ,"The endoplasmic reticulum responds to stress by initiating a cascade of events known as the 'unfolded-protein response' (UPR). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease activates this stress response, resulting in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. Although it remains uncertain whether the UPR plays a mechanistic role in prototypical neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, this is plausible because misfolded proteins are directly implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders.","Aging is characterized by a significant decline of metabolic and hormonal functions, which often facilitates the onset of severe age-associated pathologies. One outstanding example of this is the reported association of deranged signaling by insulin and insulin-like-growth-factor 1 (IGF-1) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent compelling biological data reveal effects of insulin and IGF-1 on molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathology of AD. This review discusses available biological data that highlight the therapeutic potential of the insulin-IGF-1 signaling pathway in AD.","A recent study indicates that alcohol consumption reduces the amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN), a negative deflection in the electroencephalogram associated with error commission. Here, we explore possible mechanisms underlying this result in the context of two recent theories about the neural system that produces the ERN - one based on principles of reinforcement learning and the other based on response conflict monitoring.","The entorhinal cortex (EC) is an essential component of the medial temporal lobe long-term-memory system. Recently, Egorov et al. demonstrated that neurons in layer 5 of the EC show graded persistent activity: each neuron could maintain a constant rate firing over several minutes, even in the absence of input from other neurons. These findings suggest that layer-5 EC neurons could play a central role in the formation of associations among stimuli that occur at different times.","Phosphorylation of neurofilaments has long been considered to regulate their axonal transport rate and, in doing so, to provide stability to mature axons. Interpretation of data recently obtained following C-terminal deletion experiments has prompted a challenge to this hypothesis. We present evidence that these deletion studies remain consistent with, rather than refute, a role for C-terminal phosphorylation in regulation of neurofilament axonal transport.","A fundamental problem in nervous system development is how to control progenitor-cell divisions to generate the correct number of cells for the mature brain and spinal cord. A recent report by Petersen and colleagues has identified an essential role for Numb and a related protein, Numblike, in this process. This study demonstrates that Numb and Numblike function to maintain the self-renewal properties of neural progenitor cells in the vertebrate neural tube.", ,"Defective handling of proteins is a central feature of major neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery that neuronal dysfunction or degeneration can be caused by mutations in single cellular proteins has given new opportunities to model the underlying disease processes by genetic modification of cells in vitro or by generation of transgenic animals carrying the disease-causing gene. Recent developments in recombinant viral-vector technology have opened up an interesting alternative possibility, based on direct gene transfer to selected subregions or subsets of neurons in the brain. Using the highly efficient adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, recent reports have shown that overexpression of mutated human huntingtin or alpha-synuclein in neurons in the striatum or substantia nigra induces progressive neuropathology and neurodegeneration, similar to that seen in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. Targeted overexpression of disease-causing genes by recombinant viral vectors provides a new and highly flexible approach for in vivo modeling of neurodegenerative diseases, not only in mice and rats but also in primates.","Direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond to image motion in a ""preferred"" direction but not the opposite ""null"" direction. Extracellular spike recordings from rabbit DSGCs suggested that the key mechanism underlying the directional responses is spatially offset inhibition projecting in the null direction. Recent patch-clamp recordings have shown that this inhibition, which acts directly on the DSGC, is already direction selective. Dual recordings established that the inhibition arises from starburst amacrine cells (SBACs) located on the null side of the DSGC but not from those on the preferred side. Thus, for each radially symmetric SBAC, processes pointing in different directions would provide the null-direction inhibition to subtypes of DSGCs with different preferred directions. Ca2+ imaging revealed that the SBAC terminal processes respond more strongly to image motion away from the soma than towards the soma, therefore accounting for the direction selectivity of the inhibitory input to the DSGCs.","Sensory experience is known to shape the maturation of cortical circuits during development. A paradigmatic example is the effect of monocular deprivation on ocular dominance of visual cortical neurons. Although visual cortical plasticity has been widely studied since its initial discovery by Hubel and Wiesel >40 years ago, the description of the underlying molecular mechanisms has lagged behind. Several new findings are now beginning to close this gap. Recent data deepen our knowledge of the factors involved in the intercellular communication and intracellular signaling that mediate experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex. In addition, new findings suggest a role for the extracellular matrix in inhibition of ocular-dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex.","Dendritic spines, which receive most of the excitatory synaptic input in the cerebral cortex, are heterogeneous with regard to their structure, stability and function. Spines with large heads are stable, express large numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and contribute to strong synaptic connections. By contrast, spines with small heads are motile and unstable and contribute to weak or silent synaptic connections. Their structure-stability-function relationships suggest that large and small spines are ""memory spines"" and ""learning spines"", respectively. Given that turnover of glutamate receptors is rapid, spine structure and the underlying organization of the actin cytoskeleton are likely to be major determinants of fast synaptic transmission and, therefore, are likely to provide a physical basis for memory in cortical neuronal networks. Characterization of supramolecular complexes responsible for synaptic memory and learning is key to the understanding of brain function and disease.","The numbers, types and locations of stem cells in the nervous system have been the subject of much discussion. This review summarizes data on the types of stem cell present at different stages of development and in the adult brain, and the markers suggested to distinguish between the various possibilities that have been reported. We present evidence that more than one class of stem cell is present in the developing and adult nervous systems, and that it might be possible to distinguish between stem-cell populations and to localize the cell of origin of a particular neurosphere, based on markers that persist in culture and by using universal stem-cell markers prospectively to identify stem cells in vivo.","The current dominant model of binaural sound localization proposes that the lateral position of a sound source is determined by the position of maximal activation within an array of binaural coincidence-detector neurons that are tuned to different interaural time differences (ITDs). The tuning of a neuron for an ITD is determined by the difference in axonal conduction delay from each ear--the so-called ""delay line"" hypothesis. Although studies in birds appear to support this model, recent evidence from mammals suggests that the model does not provide accurate descriptions of how ITDs are encoded in the mammalian auditory brainstem or of how ITD-sensitive neurons contribute to mammalian sound localization.", ,Comment on Nat Neurosci. 2003 Jan;6(1):43-50.,Comment on Science. 2002 Nov 29;298(5599):1785-8. Science. 2002 Nov 29;298(5599):1781-5.,Comment on EMBO J. 2000 Jan 4;19(1):67-77.,"As long as 150 years ago, when Fritz and Hitzig demonstrated the electrical excitability of the motor cortex, scientists and fiction writers were considering the possibility of interfacing a machine with the human brain. Modern attempts have been driven by concrete technological and clinical goals. The most advanced of these has brought the perception of sound to thousands of deaf individuals by means of electrodes implanted in the cochlea. Similar attempts are underway to provide images to the visual cortex and to allow the brains of paralyzed patients to re-establish control of the external environment via recording electrodes. This review focuses on two challenges: (1) establishing a 'closed loop' between sensory input and motor output and (2) controlling neural plasticity to achieve the desired behavior of the brain-machine system. Meeting these challenges is the key to extending the impact of the brain-machine interface.","The involvement of the striatum in numerous forms of learning and memory is likely to be based on changes in neuronal activity when specific behavioral tasks are being learned. Striatal neurons show distinctive changes when animals learn the significance of stimuli that predict rewards and induce the preparation of movements. These changes resemble some of the simultaneous, learning-related changes in closely associated areas of the frontal cortex. The striatal changes might assist in adapting existing reward expectations and behaviors to novel or changing environmental conditions and they could contribute to the functions of the basal ganglia in learning, reward expectation and movement preparation.","A novel photoreceptor of the mammalian retina has recently been discovered and characterized. The novel cells differ radically from the classical rod and cone photoreceptors. They use a unique photopigment, most probably melanopsin. They have lower sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution than rods or cones and they seem specialized to encode ambient light intensity. Most surprisingly, they are ganglion cells and, thus, communicate directly with the brain. These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) help to synchronize circadian rhythms with the solar day. They also contribute to the pupillary light reflex and other behavioral and physiological responses to environmental illumination.","How the brain becomes lateralized is poorly understood. By contrast, much is known about molecular cues that specify the left-right axis of the body, fashioning the asymmetric morphology and positioning of the visceral organs. In zebrafish, the Nodal signaling pathway functions in visceral asymmetry and also in the embryonic brain, to bias laterality of the epithalamus. Formation of an asymmetric pineal complex differentially influences adjacent diencephalic nuclei, the left and right habenulae, which acquire distinctive molecular and cellular features. Results from the genetically tractable zebrafish system provide a promising entry point for exploring how left-right biases are established and propagated in the developing vertebrate brain.","Pain is conventionally viewed as a pattern of convergent activity within the somatosensory system that represents the exteroceptive sense of touch. Accumulating functional, anatomical and imaging findings indicate that pain is generated by specific sensory channels that ascend in a central homeostatic afferent pathway. Phylogenetically new thalamocortical projections in primates provide a sensory image of the physiological condition of the body and, in addition, direct activation of limbic motor cortex. These findings indicate that the human feeling of pain is both a distinct sensation and a motivation - that is, a specific emotion that reflects homeostatic behavioral drive, similar to temperature, itch, hunger and thirst.","Glutamate, a key neurotransmitter, is pivotal to CNS function. Alterations in its concentration can be dangerous, as seen for example in acute injuries of the CNS, chronic neurodegenerative disorders and mental disorders. Its homeostasis is attributed to the efficient removal of glutamate from the extracellular milieu by reuptake via local transport mechanisms. Our recent studies suggest that glutamate, either directly or indirectly, elicits a purposeful systemic T-cell-mediated immune response directed against immunodominant self-antigens that reside at the site of glutamate-induced damage. We suggest that the harnessed autoimmunity (which we have termed 'protective autoimmunity') helps the resident microglia in their dual function as antigen-presenting cells (serving the immune system) and as cells that clear the damaged site of potentially harmful material (serving the nervous system). The interplay between glutamate and an adaptive immune response illustrates the bidirectional dialog between the immune and nervous systems, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These results point to the possible development of a therapeutic vaccination with self-antigens, or with antigens cross-reactive with self-antigens, as a way to augment autoimmunity without inducing an autoimmune disease, thus providing a safe method of limiting degeneration. This approach, which boosts a physiological mechanism for the regulation of glutamate, and possibly also that of other self-compounds, might prove to be a feasible strategy for therapeutic protection against glutamate-associated neurodegenerative or mental disorders.","Recent studies suggest that non-neural cells can generate neurons in mice and humans. There is no lack of excitement about these results: they challenge our view of cellular differentiation and the prospect of being able to generate neurons from, for example, blood is very attractive. But is it too good to be true?","When different images are presented to the two eyes, binocular rivalry can occur - that is, perceptual alternations between the two monocular images (bi-stability) or between more than two percepts comprised of complementary portions of the two images (multi-stability). A recent paper reports important findings about the dynamics of multi-stable alternations in binocular rivalry.",Pavlovian conditioning of the response to fear has provided an important model for memory formation in mammals. Several studies have begun to identify the key signal-transduction components that provide the molecular basis for this complex neural process. A recent report has revealed that the Rho GTPase and its regulator p190 Rho-GTPase-activating protein (p190 RhoGAP) also play an important regulatory role in fear memory formation.,"Cortical development is a complex process in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors modulate the sequential generation of neurons and glia. Following successive rounds of division, precursors become determined along a neuronal or glial lineage prior to cell cycle exit and differentiation. Although the influence of growth factors in cell fate specification is not new, until recently little was known about the signaling pathways by which they regulate neuronal differentiation. Menard and colleagues have examined this issue and have demonstrated a role for the MEK-C/EBP (mitogen-activated-protein-kinase kinase and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) pathway in the promotion of growth factor-mediated neurogenesis.","Several functional brain imaging techniques have been used to study human cortical organization. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) offers perhaps the best combination of spatial coverage, resolution and speed for mapping the functional topography of human cortex. In this review, we discuss recent advances in optical imaging technology and methodology that have made human OIS easier to implement and more accessible, including improvements in detector characteristics and the development of sophisticated algorithms for reducing motion artifact. Moreover, we discuss how these advances have helped enhance our understanding of the functional organization of the human brain. We also review newly developed analyses for interpreting and validating optical signals, including refined signal analysis techniques and multimodality comparisons. Combined, these advances have enabled the study of not only primary sensory and motor cortices, but also higher cognitive processes such as language production and comprehension. Continued improvement and implementation of this technique promises to shed new light on the functional organization of human cortex.","The neural circuitry of the spinal cord is capable of solving some of the most complex problems in motor control. Therefore, spinal mechanisms are much more sophisticated than many neuroscientists give them credit for. A key issue in motor control is how sensory inputs direct and inform motor output,--that is, the sensorimotor process. Other major issues involve the actual control of the motor apparatus. In general, there are at least three basic requirements for motor control: the transformations that map information from sensory to motor coordinates, the specification of individual muscle activations to achieve a kinematic goal, and the control of multiple degrees of freedom. Here, we make the case that the vertebrate spinal cord has the capacity to solve each of these problems to a degree that is relevant for normal behavior.","How the dendritic branching patterns of different neurons are specified is a fascinating question in developmental neurobiology. This question can now be addressed in detail in Drosophila, owing to technological advances that allow in vivo labeling of the dendrites of identifiable neurons. Recent genetic analyses in flies have uncovered several molecules, including transcription factors, cytoskeleton-associated proteins and membrane receptor-like molecules, that provide a glimpse into the complex regulatory network that controls dendritic morphogenesis.","Classical transmitters and neuropeptides can be released from the dendrites of many neuronal populations, to act as retrograde signals that modulate synaptic transmission, electrical activity and, in some cases, morphology of the cell of origin. For the hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells that release vasopressin and oxytocin, the stimuli, mechanisms and physiological functions of dendritic release have been revealed in detail that is not yet available for other neurons. The regulation of dendritic transmitter release is complex and at least partially independent from axon terminal release. Here, we provide an overview of recent findings on the mechanisms and physiological consequences of dendritic neuropeptide release and place this in the context of discoveries of dendritic neurotransmitter release in other brain regions.","Practically any stimulus capable of causing injury to a tissue or organ can, when applied close to (but below) the threshold of damage, activate endogenous protective mechanisms--thus potentially lessening the impact of subsequent, more severe stimuli. A sub-threshold ischemic insult applied to the brain, for example, activates certain cellular pathways that can help to reduce damage caused by subsequent ischemic episodes--a phenomenon known as 'ischemic preconditioning' (IP) or 'ischemic tolerance' (IT). Although investigated for some time in model organisms, IP/IT has recently been shown in human brain. This opens a window into endogenous neuroprotection and, potentially, a window of opportunity to utilize these mechanisms in the clinic to treat patients with stroke and other CNS disorders.","Current emphasis on odorant physiochemical features as the basis for perception largely ignores the synthetic and experience-dependent nature of olfaction. Olfaction is synthetic, as mammals have only limited ability to identify elements within even simple odor mixtures. Furthermore, olfaction is experience-bound, as exposure alone can significantly affect the extent to which stimuli can be discriminated. We propose that early analytical processing of odors is inaccessible at the behavioral level and that all odors are initially encoded as 'objects' in the piriform cortex. Moreover, we suggest that odor perception is wholly dependent on the integrity of this memory system and that its loss severely impairs normal perception.","Efficient and accurate synaptic transmission requires proper localization of numerous signaling proteins in the synaptic membrane. At the neuromuscular junction, the nicotinic ACh receptor mediates postsynaptic depolarization, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminates this process by hydrolyzing ACh. The mechanism by which the nerve directs receptor localization is understood in considerable detail; AChE clustering, by contrast, has received much less attention. Now, in a recent paper in Nature Neuroscience, the laboratories of Yoshiko Yamada and Richard Rotundo report that AChE clustering at the postsynaptic membrane requires perlecan, which binds both AChE and dystroglycan.",Fukushima and colleagues have found single neurons in monkey frontal cortex that control pursuit eye movements by representing extra-personal space in a 3D-coordinate frame. These cells might link the 2D depiction of visual space by the retina with the need of the body to act in the 3D world. We could be on the verge of a new understanding of coordinate transformations serving sensory-motor integration in cerebral cortex.,"In the dominant paradigm for functional interactions between G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels, the mantra is that the interactions are indirect, indirect, indirect. It is commonly understood that activating GPCRs engages one or more sets of intracellular signaling cascades that indirectly affect the function or localization of a cohort of ligand-gated ion channels. Conversely, stimulating ligand-gated channels, particularly those that are permeable to Ca(2+), indirectly produces effects on GPCRs and/or on GPCR-activated signaling cascades. The foundation of this dichotomous world-view shook (just a little) when it was discovered that D5 dopamine receptors bind directly to GABA(A) receptors, and that this direct interaction reciprocally affects the signaling of both types of receptor. Now, D1 dopamine receptors also have got into the act!",Binding of neurotrophins to p75(NTR) was recently identified as a positive signal for myelination by Schwann cells. This new finding adds yet another distinct biological role to the growing list of functions of p75(NTR) in the nervous system and identifies a novel target for promoting remyelination in peripheral neuropathies or post-nerve-injury.,DOI: 10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00075-4 PMID: 12744835  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],"Not so long ago, the auditory cortex took a back seat to the visual system in neuroscience research. With some notable exceptions outside the primate order, such as the classic work on echo-locating bats, owls and birdsong, the auditory cortex has been overlooked: only a few investigators were involved in understanding the structure and function of the monkey auditory cortex, and even fewer had the means to study its human counterpart. This situation has undergone a dramatic change in the past decade or so. Spurred on by advances in primate neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, and especially by developments in functional neuroimaging, substantial progress is now being made into understanding how the human auditory cortical system works.","The brain is an organ that processes information. Brain systems such as the cerebellum receive inputs from other systems and generate outputs according to their internal rules of information processing. Thus, our understanding of the cerebellum is ultimately best expressed in terms of the information processing it accomplishes and how cerebellar neurons and synapses produce this processing. We review evidence that indicates how Pavlovian eyelid conditioning reveals cerebellar processing to be an example of feedforward control. Eyelid conditioning demonstrates a capacity for learning in the cerebellum that is error driven, associative and temporally specific--as is required for feedforward control. This computation-centered view is consistent with a variety of proposed functions of the cerebellum, including sensory-motor integration, motor coordination, motor learning and timing. Moreover, feedforward processing could be the common link between motor and non-motor functions of the cerebellum.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2004 Mar;27(3):125-7; author reply 127-8.,"The cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the aggregation of a normal protein, beta-amyloid (Abeta), within the neocortex. Recently, evidence has been gathered to suggest that Abeta precipitation and toxicity in AD are caused by abnormal interactions with neocortical metal ions, especially Zn, Cu and Fe. However, Abeta might also participate in normal metal-ion homeostasis. An inevitable, age-dependent rise in brain Cu and Fe might hypermetallate the Abeta peptide, causing the catalysis of H(2)O(2) production that mediates the toxicity and auto-oxidation of Abeta. The greater incidence of AD in females could be due to greater constitutive activity of the synaptic Zn transporter ZnT3, and attenuated binding of metal ions to the rodent homologue of Abeta might explain why these animals are spared Alzheimer's pathology. Compounds that interdict metal-ion binding to Abeta dissolve brain deposits in vitro and one such compound, clioquinol, inhibits Abeta deposition in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD and could be useful clinically. These insights could also apply to other degenerative disorders in which metal-ion-protein interactions have been implicated.","Electrical signaling in neurons is based on the operation of plasmalemmal ion pumps and carriers that establish transmembrane ion gradients, and on the operation of ion channels that generate current and voltage responses by dissipating these gradients. Although both voltage- and ligand-gated channels are being extensively studied, the central role of ion pumps and carriers is largely ignored in current neuroscience. Such an information gap is particularly evident with regard to neuronal Cl- regulation, despite its immense importance in the generation of inhibitory synaptic responses by GABA- and glycine-gated anion channels. The cation-chloride co-transporters (CCCs) have been identified as important regulators of neuronal Cl- concentration, and recent work indicates that CCCs play a key role in shaping GABA- and glycine-mediated signaling, influencing not only fast cell-to-cell communication but also various aspects of neuronal development, plasticity and trauma.","CNS myelin inhibits axonal outgrowth in vitro and is one of several obstacles to functional recovery following spinal cord injury. Central to our current understanding of myelin-mediated inhibition are the membrane protein Nogo and the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR). New findings implicate NgR as a point of convergence in signal transduction for several myelin-associated inhibitors. Additional studies have identified a potential coreceptor for NgR as p75(NTR), and a second-messenger pathway involving RhoA that inhibits neurite elongation. Although these findings expand our understanding of the molecular determinants of adult CNS axonal regrowth, the physiological roles of myelin-associated inhibitors in the intact adult CNS remain ill-defined.","Drug addiction can take control of the brain and behavior, activating behavioral patterns that are directed excessively and compulsively toward drug usage. Such patterns often involve the development of repetitive and nearly automatic behaviors that we call habits. The striatum, a subcortical brain region important for proper motor function as well as for the formation of behavioral habits, is a major target for drugs of abuse. Here, we review recent studies of long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum, emphasizing that drugs of abuse can exert pronounced influences on these processes, both in the striatum and in the dopaminergic midbrain. Synaptic plasticity in the ventral striatum appears to play a prominent role in early stages of drug use, whereas dopamine- and endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum could contribute to the formation of persistent drug-related habits when casual drug use progresses towards compulsive drug use and addiction.", ,Comment on Nat Neurosci. 2002 Oct;5(10):963-70.,Comment on Science. 2002 Aug 30;297(5586):1525-31.,Comment on Nat Neurosci. 2002 Oct;5(10):971-8.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, trkB, activate cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) and the transcription of genes that is crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP). Any of several signaling pathways activated by trkB could be required for LTP. A recent study using mice carrying a mutation in a specific tyrosine residue of trkB pinpoints a necessary role for the phospholipase-Cgamma (PLCgamma) pathway in CREB activation and LTP maintenance.",The vertebrate olfactory system must cope with a staggering developmental problem: how to connect millions of olfactory neurons expressing different odorant receptors to appropriate targets in the brain. Recent studies demonstrate remarkable plasticity in integrating novel olfactory neurons into this circuitry.,"What is the functional significance of generating a burst of spikes, as opposed to a single spike? A dominant point of view is that bursts are needed to increase the reliability of communication between neurons. Here, we discuss the alternative, but complementary, hypothesis: bursts with specific resonant interspike frequencies are more likely to cause a postsynaptic cell to fire than are bursts with higher or lower frequencies. Such a frequency preference might occur at the level of individual synapses because of the interplay between short-term synaptic depression and facilitation, or at the postsynaptic cell level because of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations and resonance. As a result, the same burst could resonate for some synapses or cells and not resonate for others, depending on their natural resonance frequencies. This observation suggests that, in addition to increasing reliability of synaptic transmission, bursts of action potentials might provide effective mechanisms for selective communication between neurons.","From the first glimpse of moving spines half a decade ago, the prevailing view has been that spine contortions and wiggling, especially during development, maximize encounters with presynaptic growth cones or synaptic boutons. Other new evidence has revealed that spines continue to be motile even after they settle on a presynaptic partner and form a synapse. We present the evidence for each view, and discuss how spines with synapses could move relative to their apparently stable presynaptic partners. Thus, spine motility might not simply be a means towards an end of synapse formation, but could continue, albeit at a lower rate, during synapse turnover after development ends.","How effective are synaptic inputs made at different dendritic sites in the control of action potential output? Recent technical advances have allowed direct observation of the amplitude and time course of excitatory synaptic inputs generated at defined dendritic sites. These findings indicate that contrasting mechanisms exist to enhance the impact of dendritic excitatory inputs to pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, multiple sites of synaptic integration have been revealed, suggesting that proximal and distal inputs are likely to be integrated in different ways. Taken together, these data emphasize the cell- and input-specific strategies used by neurons to enhance the impact of dendritic inputs on action potential generation.","Folate is a cofactor in one-carbon metabolism, during which it promotes the remethylation of homocysteine -- a cytotoxic sulfur-containing amino acid that can induce DNA strand breakage, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Dietary folate is required for normal development of the nervous system, playing important roles regulating neurogenesis and programmed cell death. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies have linked folate deficiency and resultant increased homocysteine levels with several neurodegenerative conditions, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, genetic and clinical data suggest roles for folate and homocysteine in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the roles of folate and homocysteine in neuronal homeostasis throughout life is revealing novel approaches for preventing and treating neurological disorders.","To elucidate pathways from specific genes to complex behaviors, assays of mouse behavior need to be valid, reliable and replicable across laboratories. Behavioral assays are proving to be as complex as the intricate cellular and molecular pathways that are the main interest of many mouse users. There is no perfect behavioral test, but we propose some aphorisms to stimulate discussion that is necessary for continued progress in task development. For maximal utility, a behavioral test should yield valid data for most of the commonly used inbred mouse strains. Tests of simple, ubiquitous behaviors usually yield meaningful data for most mice, especially when based on automated scoring or on simple physical measures that are likely to be replicable across laboratories. Extreme test scores resulting from non-performance on a task can inflate the apparent reliability of a test, and devious adaptations to a task can undermine its validity. The optimal apparatus configuration for certain genetic or pharmacological analyses might depend on the particular laboratory environment. Despite our best efforts, the mice will continue to win some innings.","A current disturbing trend in stem cell biology is the abandonment of rigorous definitions of stem and progenitor cells in favor of more ambiguous, all-encompassing concepts. However, recent studies suggest that there are consistent, functional differences in the biology of these two cell types. Admittedly, it can be difficult to harmonize the in vivo and in vitro functional differences between stem and progenitor cells. Nonetheless, these distinctions between cell types should be emphasized rather than ignored, as they can be used to test specific hypotheses in neural stem cell biology.","Although long-term memory is central among our cognitive functions, the search for a direct neurophysiological correlate to it has proven difficult. The formation of new memories depends on the hippocampus and adjacent cortex, but the final storage is thought to be in a widely distributed neocortical network. Recent experiments, using simultaneous recordings from hundreds of sites in monkey neocortex, have revealed the activation of such a distributed network -- probably reflecting the consolidation of long-term memory storage.",G-protein-coupled receptors generate signals that promote gene transcription through the 'transactivation' of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade -- a process that involves RTK autophosphorylation and endocytosis. Pioneering work now suggests that D4-dopamine-receptor-mediated transactivation of the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor has immediate effects on synaptic neurotransmission via Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors. The demonstration of a physiological role for RTK transactivation in the CNS provides novel opportunities for understanding how aberrant dopamine signalling might contribute to cognitive and attention deficits associated with schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Long-lasting memories are most efficiently formed by multiple training sessions separated by appropriately timed intervals. A recent study revealed that expression of a transgene encoding an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in the forebrain enhanced memory formed during sub-optimal training. Thus, PP1 apparently constrains memory formation in the mouse. Furthermore, the report proposes that PP1 promotes forgetting.","Active feedback mechanisms in the ears of mammals amplify and tune the auditory response to sound stimuli, allowing these organisms to enjoy both exquisite sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. A requisite component of this feedback pathway has recently been identified. Targeted deletion of pres, the gene that encodes the novel membrane-bound motor protein prestin, has revealed a hundred-fold loss in hearing sensitivity suggesting that it might be part of the elusive cochlear amplifier.","Since it was introduced a decade ago, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has come to dominate research on the human brain. However, fMRI maps are based on secondary metabolic and hemodynamic events that follow neuronal activity, and not on the electrical activity itself. Therefore, the representation provided by fMRI cannot be assumed a priori to be exact. The accuracy of these maps depends on the spatial extent of the metabolic and hemodynamic changes induced by neuronal activity, and the role played by the vasculature in converting these changes to signals detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Significant progress has been made in both areas, suggesting that it is possible to obtain both spatially accurate and quantitative data on brain function from magnetic resonance methodologies.","A striking property of speech perception is its resilience in the face of acoustic variability (among speech sounds produced by different speakers at different times, for example). The robustness of speech perception might, in part, result from multiple, complementary representations of the input, which operate in both acoustic-phonetic feature-based and articulatory-gestural domains. Recent studies of the anatomical and functional organization of the non-human primate auditory cortical system point to multiple, parallel, hierarchically organized processing pathways that involve the temporal, parietal and frontal cortices. Functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that a similar organization might underlie speech perception in humans. These parallel, hierarchical processing 'streams', both within and across hemispheres, might operate on distinguishable, complementary types of representations and subserve complementary types of processing. Two long-opposing views of speech perception have posited a basis either in acoustic feature processing or in gestural motor processing; the view put forward here might help reconcile these positions.","The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has long been popular with researchers interested in fundamental issues of neural development, sensory processing and behavior. Recently, advances in applying electrophysiological techniques to C. elegans have made this genetically tractable organism considerably more attractive to neurobiologists studying the molecular mechanisms of synaptic organization and function. The development of techniques that involve voltage-clamp of specific neurons and muscles has allowed the coupling of genetic perturbation techniques with electrophysiological analyses of nervous system function. Recent studies combining these biophysical and genetic techniques have provided novel insights into the mechanisms of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic responses to neurotransmitters and information processing by neural circuits.","Ca(2+) entry through the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors has the power to determine whether neurons survive or die. Too much NMDA receptor activity is harmful to neurons - but so is too little. Is it a case of too much or too little Ca(2+) influx causing cell death or do other factors, such as receptor location or receptor-associated proteins, play a role? Understanding the mechanisms behind this dichotomous signalling is an important area of molecular neuroscience with direct clinical implications.","Advances in understanding the biology of neurotrophic factors and their signaling pathways have provided important insights into the normal growth, differentiation and maintenance of neurons. Stimulated by neuropathological observations and genetic discoveries, studies in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders have begun to clarify pathogenetic mechanisms. We examine the intersection of these research themes and identify several potential mechanisms for linking failed neurotrophic factor signaling to neurodegeneration. Studies of nerve growth factor signaling in a mouse model of Down syndrome encourage the views that neuronal dysfunction and atrophy might be linked to failed neurotrophic support and that additional studies focused on this possibility would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders and their treatment.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2003 Sep;26(9):465-6; author reply 466-8.,"The neurons in the antennal lobe of the locust had been shown to encode the identity of odorants using spatially distributed synchronized patterns of neural activity. Recent work describes how such neural patterns are detected. By using non-linear membrane properties, one set of target neurons, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, are able to act as coincidence detectors, sensitive to synchronized activity. In addition, the specific circuitry between the antennal lobe and the mushroom body refines the spatial-temporal selectivity of the Kenyon cells. In this process, the neural representation of odor identity is transformed from a dense spatial-temporal code into a sparse code.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, affecting approximately 1/1000 individuals in the Western world. Available treatments limit CNS inflammation and strategies to repair damage in the CNS offer the potential of recovery of both tissue and function. With further fundamental knowledge developing, this area is ripe for 'translation' to clinical application.","Combinatorial transcription codes are used widely in the developing nervous system to specify the development of many distinct cell types. Although this strategy maximizes the use of small numbers of proteins, the molecular basis for imposing specificity remains unclear. A recent study has addressed this question by demonstrating that the favoring of hexameric complexes of specific LIM homeodomain proteins over tetramers could dictate the choice between motor neuron versus interneuron fate.","Voltage-gated Na(+) channels play key roles in generating and propagating action potentials. Their gating is believed to rely exclusively on changes in membrane potential. However, recent data from Blum, Kafitz and Konnerth provide direct evidence that the opening of Na(v)1.9, a member of the voltage-gated Na(+) channel family, is mediated by ligand binding rather than by voltage. This is arguably one of the most influential ideas brought to us in the history of the Na(+) channel field.","Ca(2+) and cAMP signalling pathways are tightly interconnected and the cellular effects mediated by the two second messengers depend strictly on reciprocal modulation. The signalling network that derives from such interplay holds the potential for expanding the information content of the signal enormously and, thus, can contribute substantially to the specificity and diversity of the response. Recent work points to interdependent Ca(2+) and cAMP oscillation patterns as a new paradigm for signal transduction.","Eph receptors, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and their ephrin ligands are important mediators of cell-cell communication regulating cell attachment, shape and mobility. Both Ephs and ephrins are membrane-bound and their interactions at sites of cell-cell contact initiate unique bidirectional signaling cascades, with information transduced in both the receptor-expressing and the ligand-expressing cells. Recent structural and biophysical studies summarized in this review reveal unique molecular features not previously observed in any other receptor-ligand families and explain many of the biochemical and signaling properties of Ephs and ephrins. Of particular importance is the insight into how approximation of ligand-expressing and receptor-expressing cells could lead to the formation and activation of highly ordered signaling centers at cell-cell interfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,"More and more neurological patients use some form of complementary and alternative medicine. Contrary to what many sceptics believe, not all of these approaches are useless. Contrary to what many proponents think, not all treatments are harmless. Neurologists should know more about complementary and alternative medicine and should advise their patients responsibly.","Development of the nervous system can be schematically summarized as (1) making the necessary cells, (2) putting these cells in the right places, and then (3) connecting them appropriately. Each of these steps represents an enormous challenge to our understanding. Focusing on the vertebrate retina, I will consider the question of what defines the right place for a neuron to go. I will illustrate data pointing to the prominent role played by short-range cellular interactions, possibly coordinated by global factors, and will discuss how a few sets of local rules could control cell positioning and proper wiring in retinal circuits.","Oscillating levels of clock gene transcripts in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are essential components of the mammalian circadian pacemaker. Their synchronization with daily light cycles involves neural connections from light-sensitive photoreceptor-containing retinal ganglion cells. This clock orchestrates rhythmic expression for approximately 10% of the SCN gene transcripts, of which only 10% are also rhythmically expressed in other tissues. Many of the transcripts expressed rhythmically only in the SCN are involved in neurosecretion, and their secreted products could mediate SCN control over physiological rhythms by coordinating rhythmicity in other nuclei within the brain. The coordination of clock gene transcript oscillations in peripheral tissues could be controlled directly by specific signals or indirectly by rhythmic behavior such as feeding.","Despite its highly diffusible nature, the gaseous signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) can exert specific effects within the CNS and PNS. To date, the specificity of the actions of NO remains an unsolved puzzle. There are several plausible mechanisms that might account for this specificity in the context of autonomic regulation of heart rate. NO acts at distinct levels within the autonomic nervous system to control cardiac rate, with opposing effects at different sites. We discuss factors that might contribute to this diversity of action, and conclude that the isoform of enzyme involved in producing NO, the spatial proximity of the NO source to the target, and differences in the intracellular coupling within the target cell are all crucial for encoding the functional action of NO.","The haemodynamic responses to neural activity that underlie the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain are often assumed to be driven by energy use, particularly in presynaptic terminals or glia. However, recent work has suggested that most brain energy is used to power postsynaptic currents and action potentials rather than presynaptic or glial activity and, furthermore, that haemodynamic responses are driven by neurotransmitter-related signalling and not directly by the local energy needs of the brain. A firm understanding of the BOLD response will require investigation to be focussed on the neural signalling mechanisms controlling blood flow rather than on the locus of energy use.","Alzheimer's and prion pathologies are often seen as distinct neurodegenerative diseases, particularly because the infectious character of some prion-associated pathology makes this stand apart from classical neurodegenerative, age-related syndromes. Are there specific common denominators that could link the two diseases? It appears that betaAPP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) and PrP(c) (cellular prion protein), the 'guilty' proteins involved in these pathologies, undergo protein-kinase-C-regulated proteolysis by identical proteases of the disintegrin family. This cleavage occurs in an analogous way, in the middle of the 'toxic' Abeta and PrP(c)106-126 domains of betaAPP and PrP(c), respectively. As these two sequences trigger similar caspase-dependent and -independent cascades, this proteolytic attack could be seen as an inactivating process aimed at clearing cells of these endogenous 'toxins' and, thus, preventing the associated proteinaceous accumulation usually detected in affected brains. It is our opinion that targeting these disintegrins with specific 'activators' could be a suitable strategy to slow down, or even arrest, betaAPP and PrP(c)-related aggregation and toxicity.","In laboratory animals, repeated administration of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, morphine or alcohol, causes sensitization (reverse tolerance) to their stimulant and rewarding effects. Neuroadaptations underlying sensitization could be related to those that contribute to addictive behaviors. An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sensitization could lead to improved treatments for addiction. Here, we review evidence that the ability of drugs of abuse to elevate levels of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA glutamate receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain is crucial for the development of sensitization. Even transient increases in GluR1 levels within VTA neurons can trigger complex cascades of other molecular adaptations in these neurons and, within larger neural circuits, can cause enduring changes in the responses of the brain to drugs of abuse. However, there is ongoing debate over whether elevated levels of GluR1 in the VTA are a primary cause, or secondary effect, of the neurobiological underpinnings of sensitization.","Previous reports have linked Neurogenin 1 with the general promotion of neurogenesis and gliogenesis. A new study in zebrafish, supported by recent findings in Drosophila, has now challenged this idea by demonstrating that the activity of Neurogenin 1 is limited to activation of development of two classes of sensory neurons.","Mossy fiber (MF) synapses are key stations for flow of information through the hippocampal formation. A major component of the output of the MF system is directed towards inhibitory interneurons. Recent studies have revealed that the functional properties of MF-interneuron synapses differ substantially from those of MF-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. Mossy-fiber-interneuron synapses in the stratum lucidum represent a continuum of functional subtypes, in which the subunit composition of postsynaptic AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors appears to be regulated in a coordinated manner.","Depending on the precise temporal relationship between their spiking activities, connections between neurons could be modified in opposite directions. Although the functional implications of this spike-timing-dependent plasticity are not clear, several theoretical studies have indicated that it could underlie important effects such as sequence learning, predictive learning and balancing excitation and inhibition. To explore fully this novel form of synaptic plasticity, it is crucial to understand how the modification builds up over the consecutive spikes of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. In the absence of solid data, many theorists assumed a linear summation model. However, recent experiments specifically devised to study this issue have demonstrated that the effects of the consecutive spikes on the overall modification steadily decline, indicating strong non-linearities in the corresponding learning rules.","Getting AMPA receptors into and out of synapses represents an important mechanism for changing synaptic strength, but the signals that target AMPA receptors for removal from the synaptic membrane are incompletely understood. A recent study in Ceanorhabditis elegans suggests that ubiquitination of AMPA receptors is one important signal that targets these receptors for endocytosis.","Neuroscientists across Europe have been busy finding or consolidating partnerships, and sharpening their e-pencils, as they prepare for the next tranche of research and technology development (RTD) funding to be coordinated by the European Union. Entitled the Sixth Framework Programme, this 16 billion Euro programme is the most ambitious that the European Commission has ever mounted. It covers a broad range of RTD activities, from the very small (nanotechnology and nanosciences) to the very grand (sustainable development, global change and ecosystems). Brain research finds its place at several points in the proposals of the Commission, notably under the heading of ""Life Sciences, Genomics and Biotechnology for Health"". This includes sub-sections entitled ""Studying the brain and combating diseases of the nervous system"" and ""Studying development and ageing processes"". The focus is likely to be on exploiting molecular genetics with respect to neuroscience. Our aim in this short article is to outline some of the novel features of this ambitious program and to touch on certain issues that have been raised about it.","Parallel to his well-known work on the microarchitecture of the CNS, Santiago Ramón y Cajal conducted various investigations of its de- and regenerative capacities. However, Ramón y Cajal's theoretical stance on the issue remains rather ambiguous and can even be assumed to reflect modern views on the potential of structural plasticity in the CNS.","Ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors mediate rapid synaptic transmission in the CNS and PNS. Owing to this central role in trans-synaptic signal transduction, modulation of these receptors could play a crucial role in the expression of synaptic plasticity in the brain. AMPA receptors mediate the majority of rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS. Recent studies have indicated that the activity and synaptic distribution of these receptors is dynamically regulated and could be crucial for the short- and long-term modification of synaptic efficacy. Here we review recent data on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of AMPA receptors and the role of AMPA-receptor regulation in mediating synaptic plasticity.","Dynamic regulation of synaptic efficacy is thought to play a crucial role in formation of neuronal connections and in experience-dependent modification of neural circuitry. The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which synaptic changes are triggered and expressed are the focus of intense interest. This articles reviews recent evidence that NMDA receptors undergo dynamically regulated targeting and trafficking, and that the physical transport of NMDA receptors in and out of the synaptic membrane contributes to several forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity. The identification of targeting and internalization sequences in NMDA-receptor subunits has begun the unraveling of some mechanisms that underlie activity-dependent redistribution of NMDA receptors. Given that NMDA receptors are widely expressed throughout the CNS, regulation of NMDA-receptor trafficking provides a potentially important way to modulate efficacy of synaptic transmission.","Activity-dependent long-term changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to be important in learning, memory formation, neuronal development and pathological states of neuronal excitability in the CNS. For the past two decades, numerous studies have investigated long-term changes in synaptic efficacy at excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Although inhibitory synapses are essential for proper functioning of the neuronal network, attention has focused only recently on describing and characterizing plasticity at these types of synapse. Not surprisingly, different forms of plasticity at GABAergic, and the closely related glycinergic, synapses have been reported in several regions of the brain. Here we review these different forms of plasticity and focus on their possible roles in developing and adult neuronal networks.","Hodgkin and Huxley (H-H) model for action potential generation has held firm for half a century because this relatively simple and experimentally testable model embodies the major features of membrane nonlinearity: namely, voltage-dependent ionic currents that activate and inactivate in time. However, experimental and theoretical developments of the past 20 years force one to re-evaluate its usefulness. First, the H-H model is, in its original form, limited to the two voltage-dependent currents found in the squid giant axon and it must be extended significantly if it is to deal with the excitable soma and dendrites of neurons. Second, the macroscopic and deterministic H-H model does not capture correctly the kinetics of the Na(+) channel and it cannot account for the stochastic response to current injection that arises from the discrete nature of ion channels. Third, much simpler integrate-and-fire-type models seem to be more useful for exploring collective phenomena in neuronal networks. Is the H-H model threatened, or will it continue to set the fundamental framework for exploring neuronal excitability?","In 1939, A.L. Hodgkin and I found that the nerve action potential shows an ""overshoot""--that is, the interior of the fibre becomes electrically positive during an action potential. In 1948, we did our first experiments with a voltage clamp to investigate the current-voltage relations of the nerve membrane. Between those dates, we spent much time speculating about the mechanism by which ions cross the membrane and how the action potential is generated. This article summarizes these speculations, none of which has been previously published.","Modern neuroscientists are accustomed to the detailed information on the structure and function of membrane ion channels that can be obtained by the combination of molecular biology, crystallography and patch-clamp recordings. It can be difficult for us to appreciate how hard it was for humankind to realize that physical events underlie nervous function and, moreover, to appreciate how long it took to devise a realistic model for the generation and propagation of the nerve impulse.","""Cytokines and the ageing brain"". Held in Palais de Congres, Arcachon, France on 1-3 June 2002.","During development, the numbers and positions of neurons and glial cells must become precisely matched. A recent study has addressed how the zebrafish lateral line nerve matches up with its glia. Using elegant two-color time-lapse imaging, the authors showed that migrating glia track along the axons precisely and very closely. Combined genetic and embryonic perturbations showed that glia require axons for migration, but not vice versa; however, glia are later required for proper maintenance of axonal fasciculation.","Dendritic spines are now known to be subject to use-dependent plasticity that affects both their structure and their numbers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a use-dependent increase in the density of dendritic spines occurs in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the mouse barrel cortex. Furthermore, it has been shown that although this increase in the density of spines and excitatory synapses is transient, the increase in spinous inhibitory synapses is long-lasting. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that synapses in the mature cortex are subject to continual use-dependent plasticity.","In the C57BL/Wld(S) mouse, a dominant mutation dramatically delays Wallerian degeneration in injury and disease, possibly by influencing multi-ubiquitination. Studies on this mouse show that axons and synapses degenerate by active and regulated mechanisms that are akin to apoptosis. Axon loss contributes to neurological symptoms in disorders as diverse as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, peripheral neuropathies and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, but it has been largely neglected in neuroprotective strategies. Defects in axonal transport, myelination or oxygenation could trigger such mechanisms of active axon degeneration. Understanding how these diverse insults might initiate an axon-degeneration process could lead to new therapeutic interventions.","Recent anatomical, physiological and computer modeling studies have revealed that oscillatory processes at the levels of single neurons and neuronal networks in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and external globus pallidus (GPe) are associated with the operation of the basal ganglia in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD). Autonomous oscillation of STN and GPe neurons underlies tonic activity and is important for synaptic integration, whereas abnormal low-frequency rhythmic bursting in the STN and GPe is characteristic of PD. These recent findings provide further support for the view that the basal ganglia use both the pattern and the rate of neuronal activity to encode information.","The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which plasticity is induced in the mature CNS (and, specifically, in the hippocampus) by environmental input are progressively being elucidated. However, the mechanisms - and even the existence - of functional and structural effects of environmental input (and, particularly, stress) early in life are incompletely understood. Here, we discuss recent evidence that stressful stimuli have a significant impact on neonatal (rat) and prenatal (human) hippocampal function and integrity. Stressful signals provoke expression and release of neuromodulators, including the peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), leading to activation of CRH receptors on principal hippocampal neurons. Although physiological activation of these receptors promotes synaptic efficacy, pathological levels of CRH at hippocampal synapses contribute to neuronal death. Thus, early-life stress could constitute a 'double-edged sword': mild stress might promote hippocampal-dependent cognitive function, whereas severe stress might impair neuronal function and survival, both immediately and in the long-term. Importantly, these CRH-mediated processes could be targets of preventive and interventional strategies.","The nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP signaling cascade has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and, more broadly, in the control of many forms of electrical activity. This raises the issue of how these second messengers regulate ion channels. The field of ion-channel modulation is dominated by G proteins; NO and cGMP are often treated as poor cousins. However, recent advances surveyed here could change this perception. A surprising new dimension to NO signaling is the direct cGMP-independent action of NO on channel proteins through S-nitrosylation. The existence of two effector pathways has important functional implications, expanding and enriching the possibilities for modulating neuronal excitability.","The ease with which genetic mutations can be induced in or introduced into mammalian organisms, such as the mouse, has created a significant need for phenotypic analysis. Developments in computer technology, instrumentation and bioinformatics, as well as in numerous neuroscience disciplines, will help to meet the demands set by the molecular revolution. As a result, the field of 'phenomics' is being born. This will integrate multidisciplinary research, with the goal of understanding the complex phenotypic consequences of genetic mutations at the level of the organism. This paper focuses on one of the disciplines that show promising developments, behavioral science.","The hippocampus plays a central role in memory consolidation, a process for converting short-term memory into cortically stored, long-lasting memory in the mammalian brain. Here, we review recent data and discuss the 'synaptic re-entry reinforcement' (SRR) hypothesis, which can account for the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation at both the molecular and systems levels. The central idea of the SRR hypothesis is that reactivation of neural ensembles in the hippocampus during the consolidation period results in multiple rounds of NMDA-receptor-dependent synaptic reinforcement of the hippocampal memory traces created during initial learning. In addition, such reactivation and reinforcement processes permit the hippocampus to act as a 'coincidence regenerator', providing coordinated input that drives the coherent reactivation of cortical neurons, resulting in the progressive strengthening of cortical memory traces through reactivation of cortical NMDA receptors.","Functional Brain Connectivity, held on 4-6 April 2002, Dusseldorf, Germany.","Meeting of the Neurodegeneration Drug Screening Consortium, held on 7-8 April 2002, Washington, DC, USA.","Synaptically released glutamate activates extrasynaptic receptors; such actions are controlled by glutamate uptake. Recent experimental findings show that there are many more glutamate transporters on the postsynaptic than presynaptic side of the vicinity of central synapses. This asymmetry favours activation of axonal, as opposed to dendritic, extrasynaptic glutamate receptors, thus imposing rule on information processing in the brain.","Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels are crucial for neurotransmitter release and other neuronal functions, and their activity-dependent regulation could underlie various aspects of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have identified Ca(2+)-sensing proteins involved in Ca(2+)-channel modulation. These have complex effects on channel gating, and data suggest that the actions of multiple Ca(2+) sensors are important for the fine-tuning of Ca(2+) channel activity.","The relative importance of spatial and temporal patterning of odor-evoked activity in the olfactory bulb is controversial. Recently, voltage-sensitive dye imaging has been used to demonstrate that odor-evoked glomerular patterns evolve over time in an odor-specific manner. The results suggest that odor information is contained in a combination of spatial and temporal response components.","The appearance of Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the world of neuroscience provoked a radical change in the course of its history. Cajal's studies of the microanatomy of virtually the whole CNS and his observations regarding degeneration and regeneration, together with his theories about the function, development and plasticity of the nervous system, had a profound impact on researchers of his era. These studies represent the roots of what are today some of the most exciting areas of discovery in terms of the structure and function of the brain in both sickness and health.","Until recently cysteine residues, especially those located extracellularly, were thought to be important for metal coordination, catalysis and protein structure by forming disulfide bonds - but they were not thought to regulate protein function. However, this is not the case. Crucial cysteine residues can be involved in modulation of protein activity and signaling events via other reactions of their thiol (sulfhydryl; -SH) groups. These reactions can take several forms, such as redox events (chemical reduction or oxidation), chelation of transition metals (chiefly Zn(2+), Mn(2+) and Cu(2+)) or S-nitrosylation [the catalyzed transfer of a nitric oxide (NO) group to a thiol group]. In several cases, these disparate reactions can compete with one another for the same thiol group on a single cysteine residue, forming a molecular switch composed of a latticework of possible redox, NO or Zn(2+) modifications to control protein function. Thiol-mediated regulation of protein function can also involve reactions of cysteine residues that affect ligand binding allosterically. This article reviews the basis for these molecular cysteine switches, drawing on the NMDA receptor as an exemplary protein, and proposes a molecular model for the action of S-nitrosylation based on recently derived crystal structures.","HIV dementia (HIVD) is among the most common and most feared neurological complications of AIDS. In vitro studies have identified a constellation of potentially neurotoxic inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathways, one or more of which could underlie HIVD. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies can distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathways in vivo and suggest that either or both might be active in different patients or at different times in the same patient. This could perhaps explain the variability in HIVD development, progression and response to therapy. These findings also suggest that MRI and MRS can identify patients at risk for HIVD and predict response to therapy.","Tackling the question of whether control of human gait is based on that of a quadrupedal locomotion system is of basic and practical relevance. During evolution, the increased influence of a direct cortical-motoneuronal system in parallel with more specialized hand function might have replaced phylogenetically older systems that organized locomotor movements. However, recent research indicates that interlimb coordination during human locomotion is organized in a similar way to that in the cat. Hence, it is hypothesized that during locomotion, corticospinal excitation of upper limb motoneurons is mediated indirectly, via propriospinal neurons in the cervical spinal cord. This allows a task-dependent neuronal linkage of cervical and thoraco-lumbar propriospinal circuits controlling leg and arm movements during human locomotor activities. The persistence of such movement control has consequences for rehabilitation and the applicability of animal research to human patients with spinal cord injury.","The basolateral region of the amygdala (BLA) plays a crucial role in making significant experiences memorable. There is extensive evidence that stress hormones and other neuromodulatory systems activated by arousing training experiences converge in regulating noradrenaline-receptor activity within the BLA. Such activation of the BLA modulates memory consolidation via BLA projections to many brain regions involved in consolidating lasting memory, including the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, nucleus basalis and cortex. Investigation of the involvement of BLA projections to other brain regions is essential for understanding influences of the amygdala on different aspects and forms of memory.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2002 Oct;25(10):539.,"Post-traumatic death of mature retinal neurons occurs in glaucoma and after optic nerve injury. The death is a dynamic process that can be fully analyzed with methods that monitor changes over time. We have coupled the development of retrogradely transportable fluorescent dyes with modification of conventional epifluorescence microscopy to manipulate and visualize rat retinal neurons in vivo. The method is a relatively new concept and has potential for the monitoring of retinal conditions, such as glaucoma or optic nerve transection, and for evaluation of neuroprotective strategies in the near future.","Ca2+ influx into dendritic spines is involved in the induction of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) by activating distinct biochemical cascades, depending on the stimulation protocol. Such conditional activation can be explained by the finding that removal of Ca2+ from spines is extremely rapid (approximately 15 ms) and promoted by a low endogenous buffering capacity. As a consequence, the time course of influx and binding kinetics are important determinants of how much Ca2+ binds to a particular enzyme. In addition structural factors, such as shape and dendritic location, could contribute to fine-tuning of spine Ca2+ handling and synaptic modification.","Uncertainty persists as to whether the amygdala is a crucial site of plasticity for classically conditioned fear or merely a sensory relay to structures generating fear responses. A recent Nature study suggests that associative synaptic changes take place in neurons of the amygdala during fear conditioning, and that these changes require dopamine-mediated modulation. Nevertheless, these findings do not prove that the amygdala is a sufficient site of plasticity for fear memory.","Although our understanding of the cellular properties of mammalian neurons is increasing rapidly, the computational function of their elaborate dendritic trees is still mysterious. In recent years, experiments have shown that, in pyramidal cells, individual dendritic compartments sustain local excitation spikes.. These dendrites also support Hebbian synaptic plasticity, which depends on the precise temporal relationship between pre- and postsynaptic spikes. In this review we discuss what we consider to be a problem with Hebbian (i.e., spike-timing-dependent) plasticity. We argue that most of the spikes that occur in dendrites are not back-propagating action potentials but but local spikes, and that Hebbian plasticity caused by local spikes can undermine the functional integrity of the geometrically complex dendritic tree. We propose that the inverted Hebbian plasticity of synapses involved in local spikes, and/or local dendritic homeostatic plasticity, could prevent an unbalanced distribution of synaptic weights on the dendritic tree.","An increased emphasis on biological causes of mental illness has been viewed as having the potential to significantly reduce stigma. From this perspective, the current genetics revolution can be seen as a source of hope. However, some have argued that biological attributions could increase stigma, for example by making the ill person seem 'defective' or 'physically distinct' -- 'almost a different species'. In this paper, I use a multicomponent conceptualization of stigma as a guide in forming hypotheses about the likely impact of genetic attributions on the stigma of mental illness.","How does an extracellular guidance molecule direct multiple growth cones to different positions? The answer is important for understanding the development of complex neural connections. UNC-6 is a member of the netrin family of guidance proteins. It has phylogenetically conserved domains that mediate its different guidance and branching activities. In the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, UNC-6 is secreted ventrally and a pattern of circumferential axon tracts develops as pioneer growth cones bearing UNC-5 and UNC-40 receptors are directed towards, or away from, the ventral sources. Following the first migrations, UNC-6 from additional sources allows more complex migration patterns to emerge. In addition, at specific dorsoventral positions, locally restricted extracellular molecules alter growth cone responses to UNC-6, causing circumferentially migrating growth cones to turn and longitudinal nerves to develop. These observations show that extracellular guidance molecules can direct complex arrangements of migrating growth cones in vivo by eliciting different types of responses, by spatially and temporally regulating their expression and by working in concert with other extracellular molecules.","Recent reports show that Olig genes, which encode the basic helix-loop-helix Olig transcription factors, are essential for development of oligodendrocytes. Surprisingly, Olig function is also required for formation of somatic motor neurons. These findings alter our views of how the oligodendrocyte lineage is generated and raise further questions about the underlying developmental relationships between neurons and glia.","Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which provide a particularly ordered lipid environment. Rafts are enriched in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, as well as proteins involved in signal transduction and intracellular trafficking. In neurons, lipid rafts act as platforms for the signal transduction initiated by several classes of neurotrophic factors, including neurotrophins and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-family ligands. Emerging evidence also indicates that such rafts are important for neuronal cell adhesion, axon guidance and synaptic transmission. Thus, lipid rafts are structurally unique components of plasma membranes, crucial for neural development and function.","Recent findings from the perirhinal cortex have shed new light on the ways in which metabotropic glutamate receptors could be involved in synaptic plasticity, and in particular in long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. Importantly, these findings have also led to a greater understanding of mechanisms that could regulate mglu-receptor signalling and the ways in which mglu receptors interact with one another.","The presence of a local mRNA translation system in axons and terminals was proposed almost 40 years ago. Over the ensuing period, an impressive body of evidence has grown to support this proposal -- yet the nerve cell body is still considered to be the only source of axonal and presynaptic proteins. To dispel this lingering neglect, we now present the wealth of recent observations bearing on this central idea, and consider their impact on our understanding of the biology of the neuron. We demonstrate that extrasomatic translation sites, which are now well recognized in dendrites, are also present in axonal and presynaptic compartments.","Diverse human disorders, including the majority of neurodegenerative diseases, are thought to arise from the misfolding and aggregation of protein. We have recently described a novel technology to amplify cyclically misfolded proteins in vitro. This procedure, named protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), is conceptually analogous to DNA amplification by PCR and has tremendous implications for research and diagnosis. The PMCA concept has been proved on the amplification of prions implicated in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In this article we describe the rational behind PMCA and some of the many potential applications of this novel technology.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):387-9.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):390.,Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):383-5.,Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):383-5.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):385-6. Trends Neurosci. 2002 Aug;25(8):386-7.,"Knockout experiments show that complexins are crucial for Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter release. In the recently solved crystal structure of complexin I bound to the synaptic SNARE complex, complexin binds along the groove between the syntaxin and synaptobrevin coils. This structure, together with NMR data, suggests that the role of complexin is to stabilize the SNARE complex as it forms from SNAREs in vesicle and target membranes.","The mechanism that allows a neuron to send cues received at its terminal to its cell body and nucleus has proved elusive. However, a recent study by Howe and colleagues indicates that neurotrophin signaling via the trkA receptor requires formation of a signaling endosome containing NGF and trkA. Thus, endocytosis of the neurotrophin-receptor complex is a crucial step in the generation of intracellular signaling platforms required for activation and compartmentalization of signaling events.","Walking the way we do is inherently unstable. Sophisticated neurological control systems are required to ensure that we progress and maintain our balance at the same time. Most of what is known about the functional organization of these neurological control systems is inferred from studies on animals. Here, I compare selected studies on the neural control of human walking with similar studies in reduced animal preparations. The simple monosynaptic reflex appears to be controlled by comparable mechanisms in walking cats and humans. However, peripheral feedback mechanisms suggested to contribute to the switch from stance to swing on the basis of experiments in reduced cat preparations have little influence during human walking. A cat whose spinal cord has been completely transected can be made to walk on a treadmill by drug injections, but such an immediate effect of pharmacological intervention is not seen in humans. However, there have been reports that pharmacological intervention can improve the walking of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury, especially when pharmacological treatment is combined with training.","The non-autonomous control of cell survival has long been thought to be a mechanism of adjusting cell populations in the vertebrate nervous system, enabling connectivity and myelination to produce a functional brain. Despite cellular evidence that analogous mechanisms occur in invertebrates, scepticism has long reigned over whether they operate in model organisms such as Drosophila. This has led to speculation that there are inherent differences between the development and evolution of simple brains and the brains of vertebrates. The great paradox has, until recently, been the absence of molecular evidence of trophic factors in Drosophila. Recent data have finally shown that EGFR (epidermal-growth-factor receptor) ligands function in the Drosophila CNS to maintain glial survival. Trophic interactions are, thus, a general mechanism of nervous system development.","Functional imaging methods exploit the relationship between neuronal activity, energy demand and cerebral blood flow to functionally map the brain. Despite the increasing use of these imaging tools in basic and clinical neuroscience, the neurobiological processes underlying the imaging signals remain unclear. Recently, interest has been focused on uncovering the signals that trigger the metabolic and vascular changes accompanying variations in neuronal activity. Advances in this field have demonstrated that release of the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate initiates diverse signaling processes between neurons and astrocytes, and that this signaling could be crucial for the occurrence of brain imaging signals. In this article we review the hypothesis that glutamate represents a common trigger for both neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling.","Many neurobiologists spurn the existence and use of direct-current (DC) electric fields (EFs) in nervous system development and regeneration. This is despite direct measurement of EFs in embryos and adults, and evidence that EFs are required for normal development, dramatically influence the rate and direction of nerve growth in vitro, and promote nerve regeneration in vivo. The notion that growth cones use EFs as guidance cues was dismissed partly because there was no convincing evidence that naturally occurring EFs influence nerve growth at the single-cell level in vivo. Recent work indicates that growth cones can be guided by EFs in vivo and, intriguingly, that in vitro guidance by chemotropic gradients and EFs might invoke similar mechanisms. Ongoing clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of DC EFs in promoting the regeneration of human spinal cord could allow EFs to achieve their potential.","It is increasingly recognized that the human planum temporale is not a dedicated language processor, but is in fact engaged in the analysis of many types of complex sound. We propose a model of the human planum temporale as a computational engine for the segregation and matching of spectrotemporal patterns. The model is based on segregating the components of the acoustic world and matching these components with learned spectrotemporal representations. Spectrotemporal information derived from such a 'computational hub' would be gated to higher-order cortical areas for further processing, leading to object recognition and the perception of auditory space. We review the evidence for the model and specific predictions that follow from it.","In this article, we consider whether studies in rats can provide useful information regarding the debate about the functions of the primate prefrontal cortex. At a superficial level, comparison of regional specializations within the prefrontal cortices of different species suggests functional correspondence. Unfortunately, the nature of functional specialization in primate prefrontal cortex is controversial, and data supporting the idea of homology between specific areas of rat and primate prefrontal cortex are weak. Nevertheless, we argue here that studies of the computational functions within the relatively undifferentiated prefrontal cortex of rats can shed light on processing in primate prefrontal cortex.","Inducing null mutations by means of homologous recombination provides a powerful technique to investigate gene function and has found wide application in many different fields. However, it was realized some time ago that the specific way in which such knockout mutants are generated can be confounding, making it impossible to separate the effects of the induced null mutation from those of alleles originating from the embryonic stem cell donor. In addition, effects from null mutations can be altered on different genetic backgrounds. Here we present some simple breeding strategies to test for flanking gene effects that are compatible with the recommendations of the Banbury Conference on Genetic Background in Mice and with common practices of creating and maintaining mouse knockout lines.",,"The past decade has seen remarkable advances in identification of the proteins regulating axon guidance and synapse formation. Understanding the structural and molecular basis of their signaling properties is now the task at hand. The recently characterized crystal structure of the complex formed between the ligand-binding domain of EphB2 and the ectodomain of its binding partner ephrin-B2 provides an insight into the recognition and signal transduction mechanisms of this large multifunctional family of surface receptors. This heterotetrameric complex reveals a cyclic arrangement of subunits not previously seen in any receptor-ligand structure, and provides a basis for class specificity of binding.","Pioneering work suggests that a synaptic active zone protein, RIM1, regulates both short- and long-term glutamatergic presynaptic plasticity at certain synapses. In short-term plasticity, RIM1 accelerates the priming of synaptic vesicles for fusion; by contrast, in long-term potentiation of mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampal CA3 region, phosphorylated RIM1 acts through an unknown molecular pathway to enhance release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.","Models of neurodegenerative disorders are challenging the classical defining role of tangles in neurotoxicity. In flies, tau overexpression is sufficient to cause neuronal death without the formation of fibrillar aggregates. This parallels observations in models of polyglutamine disorders and suggests that aggregated protein might not be the toxic species responsible for neuronal dysfunction and cell death.","Chronic pain, whether the result of nerve trauma or persistent inflammation, is a debilitating condition that exerts a high social cost in terms of productivity, economic impact and quality of life. Currently available therapies yield limited success in treating such pain, suggesting the need for new insight into underlying mechanism(s). Here, we examine the likelihood that sustained activation of descending modulatory pathways that facilitate pain transmission could underlie some states of chronic pain. Such activation of descending facilitatory pathways might be the result of neuroplastic changes that occur at medullary sites in response to persistent input of pain signals. Understanding the mechanisms of descending facilitation and the spinal effects of such discharge could provide new insights into the modulation of chronic pain.","Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with a CD8(+) phenotype have the potential to recognize and attack major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-expressing brain cells. Most brain cells, including neurons, can be stimulated to present peptides to CD8(+) CTLs by MHC class I molecules, and are susceptible to CTL-mediated cytotoxicity in culture. In disease-affected brain parenchyma, CD8(+) CTLs outnumber other T-cell subtypes. They show clonal expansion in several inflammatory and degenerative CNS diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), virus-induced inflammatory brain diseases and paraneoplastic neurological disorders. In MS, damage of axons is closely linked to the CD8(+) CTLs, and protection against CTL-mediated damage should be considered as a new therapeutic approach in MS and other neuroinflammatory diseases.","In a unique reversal of function, the ubiquitous and dominant inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, serves as the major source of neuronal excitation in the developing brain. Opening of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels following GABA(A)-receptor-mediated depolarization translates the action of GABA into trophic responses, such as changes in cell death and synaptic patterning. During a perinatal sensitive period, steroid hormones, in particular estradiol, modulate these cellular responses to differentiate male and female brains. Profound sex differences are found in the volumes of specific nuclei, and the frequencies and types of synapses, in estradiol-concentrating brain regions. Recent evidence suggests that the mechanism of estradiol action involves enhancing, and extending the duration of, the developmental excitatory effects of GABA, resulting in divergence of the signal transduction pathways activated in males versus females. This is the first identification of a pivotal point in brain development that dictates the sex differences evident in adult physiology and behavior.","The biochemical bases of the placebo effect are still incompletely known. We show here that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is due, at least in part, to the release of dopamine in the striatum. We propose that the placebo effect might be related to reward mechanisms. The expectation of reward (i.e. clinical benefit) seems to be particularly relevant. According to this theory, brain dopamine release could be a common biochemical substrate for the placebo effect encountered in other medical conditions, such as pain and depression. Other neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, however, are also likely to be involved in mediating the placebo effect (e.g. opioids in pain disorders, serotonin in depression).","Extensive research on humans suggests that exercise could have benefits for overall health and cognitive function, particularly in later life. Recent studies using animal models have been directed towards understanding the neurobiological bases of these benefits. It is now clear that voluntary exercise can increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other growth factors, stimulate neurogenesis, increase resistance to brain insult and improve learning and mental performance. Recently, high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis has demonstrated that, in addition to increasing levels of BDNF, exercise mobilizes gene expression profiles that would be predicted to benefit brain plasticity processes. Thus, exercise could provide a simple means to maintain brain function and promote brain plasticity.","Launching a new neuroscience laboratory requires knowledge of purchasing, budgeting and personnel management. The usual training of scientific investigators omits these areas, at a time when experimental complexity is growing and Internet-based commerce offers new purchasing options. This review highlights laboratory start-up maxims and their applications to web-based purchasing, cost containment and budgeting.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2002 Jul;25(7):378.,"Fast-acting neurotransmitters can exit the synaptic cleft and bind to extrasynaptic receptors. This process is modulated by transmitter uptake mechanisms (transporters). A new study focusing on glutamate-mediated transmission in the cerebellum describes the specific role of neuronal transporters in modulating the access of glutamate to extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors, and reveals important consequences of extrasynaptic signaling on synaptic plasticity.",Laying down new memories has long been thought to involve interactions between the hippocampus and multiple regions of the neocortex. Functional neuroimaging studies performed over the past four years provide evidence for this proposal. A recent electrophysiological study offers a possible mechanism by which interactions between brain regions take place during memory formation.,"The past ten years have seen an explosion in the number of genetically modified mice created to aid understanding of the basic mechanisms of learning and memory. There are still significant problems associated with this useful technique, mostly involving the lack of temporal or spatial control over the genetic 'lesion'. By combining the application of drugs that are sub-threshold in wild-type mice with heterozygosity for gene mutations that do not produce effects alone, it is now possible to avoid many of the problems of both the genetic and the pharmacological approaches.","The olfactory system has become an important model system for neurobiological function and sensory processing. In insects, odours play a vital role in all aspects of life. From the late 1950s until very recently, research into the structure and function of the insect olfactory system has often preceded similar investigations in vertebrates and has been important in the formulation of general principles.","In June 2000, the Canadian government abolished the Medical Research Council of Canada, creating the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and appointing the internationally renowned geneticist Alan Bernstein as its first president. Bernstein and the CIHR Governing Council then elaborated the novel concept of 13 'virtual' CIHR institutes (see http://www.cihr.ca for further information). These institutes are not physical entities, but virtual organizations aiming to support researchers located in universities, hospitals and research centres across Canada. Following an open competition, December 2000 saw the appointment of a scientific director to lead the development of each institute. Rémi Quirion, a neuroscientist and Professor of Psychiatry based at the Douglas Hospital Research Centre of McGill University (Montreal, Canada) is the first Scientific Director of the Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (INMHA). Here he summarizes the early developments and initiatives undertaken by his institute.","Segmentation of the vertebrate hindbrain into rhombomeres is a key step in the development of a complex pattern of differentiated neurons from a homogeneous neuroepithelium. Many of the transcription factors important for establishing the segmental plan and assigning rhombomere identity are now known. However, the downstream effectors that bring about the formation of rhombomere boundaries are only just being characterized. Here we discuss molecules that could be responsible for segregating populations of cells from different rhombomeres. We focus on recent work demonstrating that the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, function in rhombomere-specific cell sorting and initiation of a structural boundary. We discuss the contributions of two mechanisms -- cell sorting and plasticity -- to the formation of rhombomere boundaries.","The Na(v)1.9 Na(+) channel (also known as NaN) is preferentially expressed in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia. Na(v)1.9 produces a persistent, tetrodotoxin-resistant current with wide overlap between activation and steady-state inactivation, and appears to modulate resting potential and to amplify small depolarizations. These unique properties indicate that Na(v)1.9 has significant effects on the electroresponsive properties of primary nociceptive neurons. Downregulation of Na(v)1.9, which results from a lack of peripheral glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor following peripheral axotomy, might retune DRG neurons and contribute to their hyperexcitability after nerve injury. Thus, Na(v)1.9 appears to play a key role in nociception and is an attractive target in the search for more effective treatments for pain.","Synapses of the mammalian CNS are asymmetric sites of cell-cell adhesion between nerve cells. They are designed to mediate the rapid and efficient transmission of signals from the presynaptic bouton of one neuron to the postsynaptic plasma membrane of a second neuron. Significant progress has been made in the characterization of the structural, functional and developmental assembly of CNS synapses. Recent progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie synaptogenesis, in particular that of glutamatergic synapses of the CNS.","The ephrins and their Eph receptors have emerged as repulsive cues for growing axons during the past decade. Since then, great effort has been made to understand the significance and mechanisms of Eph-mediated repulsion. More recently, it has become clear that ephrins perform in many more developmental processes than the repulsion-dependent establishment of topography in the nervous system. As numerous studies suggest functions more akin to adhesion or attraction than to repulsion, increasing attention is now being paid to the intracellular mechanisms that might explain this duality.","Radial glia are specialized cells in the developing nervous system of all vertebrates, and are characterized by long radial processes. These processes facilitate the best known function of radial glia: guiding the radial migration of newborn neurons from the ventricular zone to the mantle regions. Recent data indicate further important roles for these cells as ubiquitous precursors that generate neurons and glia, and as key elements in patterning and region-specific differentiation of the CNS. Thus, from being regarded mainly as support cells, radial glia have emerged as multi-purpose cells involved in most aspects of brain development.","A central debate regarding neocortical function concerns the degree to which the underlying microcircuitry is stereotypically organized. Stereotypy reflects invariance in structure and function, as a result of common genetic templates and environmental conditions, whereas uniqueness can be caused by genetic variations, differences in environmental conditions as well as random processes. Stereotypy is an appealing concept because it provides strong support for determinism in the formation of neuronal microcircuits and in the relationship between their specific structure and function.","During the summer of 2001, Americans were treated to high political drama courtesy of the debate over embryonic and adult stem cell research. The popular press was flush with predictions about how neural stem cells would reverse, almost by magic, the devastation caused by diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke or spinal cord injury. Unfortunately, this promise remains unfulfilled because we have such a poor understanding of how stem cells function. With regard to adult stem cells, we are not even completely sure where they are, or how or when they got there. A provocative study by Ourednik et al. published in Science suggests that in primates, adult neural stem cells are allocated during early corticogenesis. The study also provides evidence for the existence of stem cells dispersed throughout the frontal cortex and striatum.","Previous studies have demonstrated that oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord and brainstem originate from restricted domains of ventral neuroepithelium under the influence of sonic hedgehog protein (SHH). However, the origin of oligodendrocytes in the telencephalon, the most anterior part of the CNS, has not been established. A recent study has precisely mapped the origin of telencephalic oligodendrocytes to a small region of the ventral telencephalon in rodents, and has presented evidence that telencephalic oligodendrogenesis is, like that of the spinal cord, under the influence of SHH signaling.","Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made far-reaching contributions to many areas of science, technology and art. Leonardo's pioneering research into the brain led him to discoveries in neuroanatomy (such as those of the frontal sinus and meningeal vessels) and neurophysiology (he was the first to pith a frog). His injection of hot wax into the brain of an ox provided a cast of the ventricles, and represents the first known use of a solidifying medium to define the shape and size of an internal body structure. Leonardo developed an original, mechanistic model of sensory physiology. He undertook his research with the broad goal of providing physical explanations of how the brain processes visual and other sensory input, and integrates that information via the soul.","Life span is determined by both environmental and genetic influences. The importance of genes is illustrated by the fact that single gene mutations extend life span in nematodes, fruit flies and mice. Recent reports reveal that the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by insulin-like signals from the nervous system. Hormones that control life span have recently been identified in fruit flies and mice. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine pathways could constitute an important determinant of life span across phylogeny. This review examines the evidence for nervous system control of longevity and discusses the implications for popular models for aging.","Depletion of a pool of readily releasable vesicles during repetitive presynaptic activity is a candidate mechanism for the induction of short-term synaptic depression. The large, calyx-type synaptic terminals in the brainstem auditory pathway, and especially the calyx of Held, offer unique possibilities for studying the cellular mechanisms leading to synaptic depression. Recent work at these synapses using presynaptic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings has revealed a large pool of readily releasable vesicles. During prolonged presynaptic depolarization, vesicles are released in kinetically distinct phases, indicating heterogeneity of release probability between vesicles. Heterogeneity might endow synapses with a rapid phase of depression at the onset of activity, followed by sustained and surprisingly large synaptic strength during the steady-state phase of depression. By influencing the synaptic output during repetitive activity, vesicle pool dynamics are expected to modulate information processing in neuronal networks of the CNS.","Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) release has been thought to be controlled by interacting osmoreceptors and Na(+)-detectors for > 20 years. Only recently, however, have molecular and cellular advances revealed how changes in the external concentration of Na+ and osmolality are detected during acute and chronic osmotic perturbations. In rat vasopressin-containing neurons, local osmosensitivity is conferred by intrinsic stretch-inactivated cation channels and by taurine release from surrounding glia. Na+ detection is accomplished by acute regulation of the permeability of stretch-inactivated channels and by changes in Na+ channel gene expression. These features provide a first glimpse of the integrative processes at work in a central osmoregulatory reflex.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2002 Aug;25(8):432.,"Recent physiological evidence shows that in response to stimuli and preceding motor activity, large fields of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex depolarize. It is argued that this finding is a general one and that these dynamic depolarization fields represent the computational elements of the cerebral cortex. Each depolarization field engages many more neurons than do columns and hyper-columns. These fields can be explained by cooperative neuronal computing in layers I-III of the cortex. In these layers, the computing modes might be general for all parts of the cerebral cortex and be sufficiently flexible to handle all sorts of cortical computations, including perception, memory storage, memory retrieval, thought and the production of behavior.","One of the most enduring central hypotheses in neurobiology has been that neurotransmission is determined by the quantal release of neurotransmitter. An important assumption has been that quantal size (amount of transmitter released per vesicle) is constant. Recent work has established that, for dense-core granules, quantal size can be varied by stimulation frequency, changes in second messenger levels and modification of the proteins of the exocytotic machinery. These data argue against the long-held belief in the universality of the quantal hypothesis, and raise important but controversial questions as to whether the same mechanisms could also regulate release from synaptic vesicles and contribute to synaptic plasticity.","Widespread myelination by oligodendrocytes is essential for the normal functioning of the vertebrate CNS. Oligodendrocyte precursors initially arise in restricted regions of the neuroepithelium and migrate relatively long distances to their final destinations. The signals that guide this migration have remained poorly understood, but recent studies suggest that glial precursors use similar molecular cues to those that guide axons through the complex terrain of the developing CNS. For example, in the developing optic nerve, glial-precursor migration from the brain towards the retina is guided by netrin-1 and semaphorin 3a. These studies suggest a novel mechanism governing glial precursor migration and provide new insights into development and the potential to direct CNS injury repair.","As we learn more about the functional expression of nicotinic receptors in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, intriguing interactions are being uncovered at the cellular and circuit levels. Recent work from John Dani's laboratory provides important insights into how nicotinic receptors can modify hippocampal synaptic plasticity in both positive and negative ways, and this could help explain the role of nicotinic receptors in learning and memory.",Recent opinion surveys suggest that the majority of the public is willing to accept the use of animals in research if high standards of welfare and effective regulation are in place. The public appears unaware that such standards have existed for some time. The scientific community should now re-focus its communication efforts to include the ethics and animal welfare aspects of this issue.,"Neurotrophins were originally identified as target-derived factors that regulate the survival and differentiation of innervating neurons. However, neurotrophins can also be released by presynaptic cells to stimulate postsynaptic neurons. Recent studies indicate that differences exist between the signaling pathways activated by neurotrophin stimulation of nerve terminals (retrograde signaling) and neurotrophin stimulation of cell bodies. Retrograde signaling relies on the formation of signaling endosomes, vesicles containing activated Trk receptors and their ligands. Signaling endosomes travel from the nerve terminals to remote cell bodies, where they selectively activate a novel MAP kinase, Erk5, as well as PI3 kinase, and thereby stimulate neuronal survival. The differences in the signaling pathways activated by neurotrophins, which depends on the location of stimulation, provide a mechanism by which neurons can interpret the 'where' as well as the 'what' of growth factor stimulation.","Sickness behaviour represents the expression of the adaptive reorganization of the priorities of the host during an infectious episode. This process is triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by peripheral phagocytic cells in contact with invading micro-organisms. The peripheral immune message is relayed to the brain via a fast neural pathway and a slower humoral pathway, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophage-like cells and microglia in the brain. The cellular and molecular components of this previously unsuspected system are being progressively identified. These advances are opening new avenues for understanding brain disorders, including depression.","A conformational variant of the normal prion protein PrP(C) is believed to be identical to PrP(Sc), the agent that causes prion diseases. Recently, a novel protein, named Doppel (Dpl), was identified that shares significant biochemical and structural homology with PrP(C). In specific strains of PrP(C)-deficient mouse lines, Dpl is overexpressed and causes a neurological disease. Dpl neurotoxicity is counteracted and prevented by PrP(C), but the mechanism of antagonistic PrP(C)-Dpl interaction remains elusive. In contrast to its homologue PrP(C), initial studies suggest that Dpl is dispensable for prion disease progression and for the generation of PrP(Sc). Although we are only beginning to understand its function, the discovery of Dpl has already provided some answers to long-standing questions and is transforming our understanding of prion biology.","The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their 'ligands', the ephrins, have been implicated in a large number of developmental processes, such as boundary formation, cell migration, axon guidance and vasculogenesis. A characteristic of the EphB subclass is that both EphBs and transmembrane-anchored ephrin-Bs function as receptors and as ligands, a phenomenon commonly described as 'bi-directional signalling'. Here we review recent data indicating that EphA receptors and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ephrin-As can also mediate bi-directional signalling. Moreover, characterization of the expression of ephrin-As on axons of the retinotectal and vomeronasal projections suggests that the EphA subfamily is involved in both repulsive and attractive guidance mechanisms during establishment of neuronal connections.","Mossy cells are bi-directionally connected through a positive feedback loop to granule cells, the principal cells of the dentate gyrus. This recurrent circuit is strategically placed between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA3 region. In spite of their potentially pro-convulsive arrangement with granule cells, mossy cells have not been seriously considered to promote seizures, because mossy cells, allegedly one of the most vulnerable cell types in the entire mammalian brain, have long been 'known' to die en masse in epilepsy. However, new data suggest that rumors of the rapid demise of the mossy cells might have been greatly exaggerated.","The reaggregate approach involves the regeneration of histotypical three-dimensional spheres from dispersed cells of a given tissue in suspension culture. Reaggregated spheres are used as tumour, genetic, toxicological, biohybrid and neurosphere models, and often replace animal experimentation. A particularly instructive example is the use of reaggregation to regenerate complete laminar tissue from avian embryonic retina. By revealing constraints of layered tissue formation, such retinal spheres could be instrumental for regenerative medicine, including stem cell-based tissue engineering.","Stem Cells in the Mammalian Brain: the 4th Brain Research Interactive Symposium, at the 2001 Annual Conference of the Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA, USA from November 8-10 2001.","Peripheral Nerve Society Biennial Meeting, organized in conjunction with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Research and Culture, held at Telfs, Tyrol, Austria from 8-12 September 2001.","Rhodopsin phosphorylation has provided one of the first examples of the ubiquitous regulatory pattern of specific kinases downregulating the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors. However, only recently have studies in living animals allowed us to consider the role of rhodopsin phosphorylation in a broader spectrum of visual functions, ranging from the ability of rods to generate reproducible electrical responses to their ability to adapt to darkness after substantial light exposures.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder that has been intensively studied over the last several years. In vitro and in vivo studies have led to an understanding of some of the physico-chemical properties of amyloid, a well-characterized hallmark of AD. Clioquinol is a drug that acts on amyloid by perturbing amyloid's metallo-chemistry, and Clioquinol treatment has been shown to be beneficial in a mouse model of AD. This short review examines the recent studies relating to Clioquinol and AD, and anticipates the imminent results of a Phase II trial of Clioquinol in AD, due in March 2002.","Over the past few years, a huge amount of work has provided mouse mutants for many genes required for regionalization of the developing brain. This remarkable work now offers the opportunity of unmasking new and unexpected gene functions that underlie a complex network of molecular interactions.","The production of any motor behavior requires coordinated activity in motor neurons and premotor networks. In vertebrates, this coordination is often assumed to take place through chemical synapses. Here we review recent data suggesting that electrical gap-junction coupling plays an important role in coordinating and generating motor outputs in embryonic and early postnatal life. Considering the recent demonstration of a prevalent expression of gap-junction proteins and gap-junction structures in the adult mammalian spinal cord, we suggest that neuronal gap-junction coupling might also contribute to the production of motor behavior in adult mammals.","The number of potentially intimate relationships between brain tumors and the precursor cells that contribute to normal central nervous system (CNS) development and repair now appears to be somewhat larger than would have been anticipated only a few years ago. It also appears that understanding the vulnerabilities of CNS precursor cells, and of the specific cells that they generate, might help us to reveal the biological basis for the cognitive impairment that is increasingly recognized as an adverse effect of systemic cancer therapies. Using neural stem cells as therapeutic vehicles in the treatment of brain tumors could be modified to allow repair of the damage caused by brain tumors themselves and of the neurological impairment that is frequently associated with traditional cancer treatment approaches.","Information processing in visual systems is constrained by the spatial and temporal characteristics of the sensory input and by the biophysical properties of the neuronal circuits. Hence, to understand how visual systems encode behaviourally relevant information, we need to know about both the computational capabilities of the nervous system and the natural conditions under which animals normally operate. By combining behavioural, neurophysiological and computational approaches, it is now possible in the fly to assess adaptations that process visual-motion information under the constraints of its natural input. It is concluded that neuronal operating ranges and coding strategies appear to be closely matched to the inputs the animal encounters under behaviourally relevant conditions.","Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a member of the hedgehog family of signalling molecules. SHH was initially described as a protein secreted from two signalling centres, the notochord and the floor plate. Subsequently, it was identified as a morphogen that is directly responsible for dorso-ventral patterning of the CNS. More recently, additional sites of SHH expression have been identified and multiple actions of SHH during CNS development discovered, including the specification of oligodendrocytes, proliferation of neural precursors and control of axon growth. Despite these various activities, it appears that the SHH signalling pathway is well conserved and that the same mechanisms are utilized to achieve a variety of cellular responses. Therefore, a more precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the different responses to SHH signalling is the next step in the study of this molecule and its role in the regulation of neural development.","The colors perceived by humans in response to light stimuli are generally described in terms of four color categories (reds, greens, blues and yellows), the members of which are systematically arrayed around gray. This broadly accepted description of color sensation differs fundamentally from the light that induces it, which is neither 'circular' nor categorical. What, then, accounts for these discrepancies between the structure of color experience and the physical reality that underlies it? We suggest that these differences are based on two related requirements for successful color vision: (1) that spectra be ordered according to their physical similarities and differences; and (2) that this ordering be constrained by the four-color map problem.","Recent therapeutic investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been guided by two seemingly opposed hypotheses: the amyloid cascade theory, which favors the amyloid plaques as the cause of AD; and the cholinergic theory, which favors cholinergic neuron loss as the cause. New investigations indicate that the synthesis and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to the trophic actions of nerve growth factor. A pathological cascade in both AD- and Down's syndrome-related memory loss could be triggered by alterations in APP processing or ACh-mediated neuronal function, or both, which in turn trigger the overexpression of amyloid beta, synaptic malfunction and trophic factor loss in target regions. This eventually leads to synaptic and dendritic loss with age.","Individual members of gene families often have partially redundant functions during nervous system development, making conventional genetic analysis problematic. Here we review experiments showing that several genes can be silenced together by injection of double-stranded RNAs into wild-type Drosophila embryos. By dye-labeling single neuroblasts in injected embryos, the effects of multigene silencing on individual CNS axon pathways can now be examined.","The 34th International Union of Physiological Sciences Congress, Satellite Symposium on 'Blood-brain barrier mechanisms from molecule to patient' was held at Freycinet Lodge, Tasmania, Australia from 21-24 August 2001.",Studies of the brain during noxious experience converge on the anterior cingulate cortex as a key region in the processing of pain. A recent exciting study extends this understanding to include the anterior cingulate as a center for endogenous opioid activation specific to negative pain affect.,"Three protein components of the postsynaptic density--Shank, Homer and SPAR--have been found to regulate the structural and molecular organization of dendritic spines. These new studies reveal linkages between receptor complexes, the actin cytoskeleton and signaling molecules that help shape spines.","The retinoic acid (RA)-dependent mechanisms that orchestrate the development of the hindbrain have been the focus of intense studies over the last decade. A wide range of model systems and experimental approaches have been used to provide important insights into hindbrain patterning. A recent paper could help to unify seemingly disparate observations across species and experimental approaches. Specification of the entire caudal hindbrain is fully dependent on retinoic acid, and specification of individual rhombomeres (r) follows a strict rostrocaudal sequence at precise developmental time windows. Progressively higher RA signalling is necessary for assigning more posterior territories. Complete RA deficiency results in the caudal hindbrain assuming an r4-like identity, which is postulated to be the hindbrain ground state.","John Walsh's research on electric fish, carried out between 1772 and 1775, proved fundamental for demonstrating that electricity might be involved in animal physiology, and, moreover, in favouring a period of great progress in both the physiology and physics of electrical phenomena. However, Walsh is hardly known to modern neuroscientists and is largely neglected by science historians also. One of the reasons for this neglect is that he never published his 'crucial experiment', that is the production of a spark from a discharge of the electric eel.","Genetic influences on lordosis, a mammalian social behavior, are amenable for study because of the relative simplicity of both stimuli and response. The neural circuit for lordosis involves a supraspinal loop, which is controlled by an estrogen- and progesterone-dependent signal from the medial hypothalamus and results in heightened sexual motivation. In turn, this involves elevated states of arousal, defined by increased sensory alertness, motor activity and emotional reactivity. Mice in which the gene encoding the alpha form of the estrogen receptor (ERalpha) has been knocked out show that ERalpha is crucial for lordosis behavior. Comparing ERalpha-, ERbeta- and double knockouts reveals that different patterns of sexual behaviors in mice require different patterns of ER activity. Understanding how hormonal and genetic effects on deep motivational and arousal processes contribute to their effects on specific sexual and aggressive behaviors pose significant challenges for mouse functional genomics.","In bacterial meningitis, long-term neurological sequelae and death are caused jointly by several factors: (1) the systemic inflammatory response of the host, leading to leukocyte extravasation into the subarachnoid space, vasculitis, brain edema and secondary ischemia; (2) stimulation of resident microglia within the CNS by bacterial compounds; and (3) possible direct toxicity of bacterial compounds on neurons. Neuronal injury is mediated by the release of reactive oxygen intermediates, proteases, cytokines and excitatory amino acids, and is executed by the activation of transcription factors, caspases and other proteases. In experimental meningitis, dexamethasone as an adjunct to antibiotic treatment leads to an aggravation of neuronal damage in the hippocampal formation, suggesting that corticosteroids might not be the ideal adjunctive therapy. Several approaches that interfere selectively with the mechanisms of neuronal injury are effective in animal models, including the use of nonbacteriolytic protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotics, antioxidants and inhibitors of transcription factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and caspases.","Visual perception of our environment essentially depends on the correct assembly of seven principal cell types into the functional architecture of the neuroretina. During retinogenesis these cell types derive from a common population of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) residing in the inner layer of the optic cup. In contrast to other well studied regions of the developing CNS, retinal cell diversification is apparently not achieved by spatial prepatterning into distinct progenitor domains, but rather by the sequential production of cell types in a defined histogenetic order. Several lines of evidence suggest that this observation reflects substantial intrinsic changes in the retinogenic potential of RPCs. Recent advances, however, point at the existence of a common molecular framework underlying the retinogenic potential of RPCs throughout retinal neurogenesis.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2002 Mar;25(3):169.,"The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been the predominant model of molecular pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. The finding of tau mutations in other dementias has added weight to the hypothesis as it suggests that tau-pathology is a downstream but essential part of the dementing process. However, some observations remain difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis. In transgenic mice, for example, amyloid generation does not induce the predicted cascade and in man, plaques and tangles are separated temporally and spatially. One alternative possibility is that some common factor, loss of wnt signalling for example, might induce both plaques and tangles.","The Joint International and American Neurochemistry Society Meeting was held, in collaboration with SAN (Sociedad Argentina de Neuroquímica), in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 26-31 August 2001.","The IUPS Satellite Symposium on Synaptic Transmission in the Central Nervous System was held on Heron Island, Australia from 3-6 September 2001.","Recent work from Agarwala et al. has uncovered exquisite ventral patterning in the mesencephalon. Using electroporation in chicks, they show that ectopic expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in dorsal mesencephalon can recapitulate this patterning in its entirety. These results are discussed in the context of the purported role of Shh as a morphogen.","Recent research points to an involvement of deregulated cdk5 activity in the pathogenesis of mutant SOD1-mediated disease. In addition, inhibition of this activity might promote motor neuron survival. These observations have opened the door to further research into the role of cdk5 in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2002 Jan;25(1):5-6.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Jan;25(1):7.,"Sodium channel subtypes are frequently coexpressed within neurons. Recent studies demonstrate that targeting of specific channel subtypes to distinct membrane domains of axons is regulated by local signals from myelinating glia; they also show that channel subtypes are sequentially expressed at nodes of Ranvier, indicating an unexpected regulation in the composition of these domains.","Sleep can facilitate memory formation, but its role in cortical plasticity is poorly understood. A recent study found that sleep, following monocular deprivation (MD), facilitated cortical changes in ocular dominance. The magnitude of plasticity was similar to that observed after continued MD, and larger than that seen after sleep deprivation in darkness, suggesting that sleep per se enables mechanisms of cortical plasticity. Experience-dependent plasticity during sleep could be part of a more global process of memory consolidation.","More than 70 years ago, von Economo predicted a wake-promoting area in the posterior hypothalamus and a sleep-promoting region in the preoptic area. Recent studies have dramatically confirmed these predictions. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus contains GABAergic and galaninergic neurons that are active during sleep and are necessary for normal sleep. The posterior lateral hypothalamus contains orexin/hypocretin neurons that are crucial for maintaining normal wakefulness. A model is proposed in which wake- and sleep-promoting neurons inhibit each other, which results in stable wakefulness and sleep. Disruption of wake- or sleep-promoting pathways results in behavioral state instability.","Disruption of the tight junctions (TJs) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark of many CNS pathologies, including stroke, HIV encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and bacterial meningitis. Furthermore, systemic-derived inflammation has recently been shown to cause BBB tight junctional disruption and increased paracellular permeability. The BBB is capable of rapid modulation in response to physiological stimuli at the cytoskeletal level, which enables it to protect the brain parenchyma and maintain a homeostatic environment. By allowing the ""loosening"" of TJs and an increase in paracellular permeability, the BBB is able to ""bend without breaking""; thereby, maintaining structural integrity.","Recent pharmacological and genetic studies have dramatically expanded the list of neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, enzymes, growth factors, and signaling molecules that influence aggression. In spite of this expansion, serotonin (5-HT) remains the primary molecular determinant of inter-male aggression, whereas other molecules appear to act indirectly through 5-HT signaling. We review evidence of interactions among these molecules and aggressive behavior. Slight modulations in 5-HT levels, turnover, and metabolism, or in receptor subtype activation, density, and binding affinity affect aggression. Activation of specific 5-HT receptors evokes distinct, but highly interacting, second messenger systems and multiple effectors. Understanding the interactions between 5-HT receptor subtypes should lead to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of aggression.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2002 Jan;25(1):59.,"Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders are prevalent among the elderly and might be considered as the plague of the 21st century. It is thus imperative to find cures for these conditions. The use of nerve growth factor proteins as neuroprotective therapeutics is limited by their hindered mobility through the blood-brain barrier. Peptides provide an attractive alternative. However, do peptide derivatives retain the activity of the entire protein? Are they stable? Would peptides cross the blood-brain barrier and what are the potential side effects? Examples are put forth to strengthen our opinion that peptides are important candidates for future drug development.","Increasing knowledge of neuron death mediators has led to gene therapy techniques for neuroprotection. Overexpression of numerous genes enhances survival after necrotic or neurodegenerative damage. Nonetheless, although encouraging, little is accomplished if a neuron is spared from death, but not from dysfunction. This article reviews neuroprotection experiments that include some measure of function, and synthesizes basic principles relating to its maintenance. Variations in gene delivery systems, including virus-type and latency between damage onset and vector delivery, probably impact the therapeutic outcome. Additionally, functional sparing might depend on factors related to insult severity, neuron type involved or the step in the death cascade that is targeted.","Neuropeptides 2001, 2nd Joint Meeting of the European Neuropeptide Club and the American Summer Neuropeptide Conference (11th Annual Meeting). 6-11 May 2001 with Satellite Symposium, Israeli-French Symposium, Israel Ministry of Science, Culture and Sport, 6 May 2001, held at Maale Hachmicha and Tel Aviv University, Israel.","Embryonic stem (ES) cells transplanted into the early mouse embryo have the capacity to differentiate into all cell types of the nervous system. A simplified culture system has been developed in which single ES cells transform into neural progenitor cells that go on to form neurospheres. This system is ideally suited for mechanistic studies of the earliest stages of neurogenesis. In this model, signaling via fibroblast growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein family members is important for the first steps of neural progenitor differentiation.","Studies of the peripheral nervous system have led to the concept of target-derived neurotrophic support. Neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor are now known to act as retrograde trophic factors--retrophins--that are produced in the target cells and released to presynaptic neurons. However, using brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) tagged with green-fluorescent protein to monitor the subcellular dynamics of BDNF in neurites, Tsumoto and colleagues have provided persuasive visual evidence that BDNF can be released at the synapses of brain neurons in an activity-dependent manner to act on postsynaptic neurons. Accordingly, BDNF serves as an anterophin to regulate postsynaptic development and plasticity in the central nervous system.","Cerebellar granule cells are the most abundant neurons in the brain and are crucial to the circuitry that controls motor coordination. The proliferation of granule cell precursors (GCPs) is controlled by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh), but the factors that regulate GCP differentiation remain a mystery. A recent study suggests that the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin might tell GCPs when to stop dividing and begin differentiation.","The secretion of neurotransmitters requires formation of the SNARE complex, a protein complex comprised of vesicle and plasma-membrane proteins. Recent data indicate that the SNARE complex forms in stages, suggesting that its assembly might be one way by which synaptic efficacy is regulated.","To localize a sound source in space, the auditory system detects minute differences in the arrival time of a sound between the two ears. It has long been assumed that delay lines and coincidence detectors turn these time differences into a labelled line code for source position, but recent studies challenge this view.","A unifying feature of neurodegenerative diseases is the abnormal accumulation and processing of mutant or damaged intra- and extracellular proteins; this leads to selective neuronal vulnerability and dysfunction. The ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPP) is poised to play a central role in the processing of damaged and toxic proteins by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The UPP can be overwhelmed in several neurodegenerative diseases. This results in the accumulation of toxic proteins and the formation of inclusions, and ultimately to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Further analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the UPP influences the detoxification of damaged and toxic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases could provide novel concepts and targets for the treatment and understanding of the pathogenesis of these devastating disorders.","Gene expression in the mammalian brain is highly complex and requires an immensely powerful functional genomics tool to unravel it. Antisense has the potential to meet this requirement, but has always been plagued by biological and technological hurdles that have made the technology unreliable. With recent progress in developing potent, low-toxicity nucleic acid chemistries and novel drug delivery methods to cross the blood-brain barrier, the use of antisense is gathering momentum.","The development of new methods for manipulating the animal genome by transgenic and gene-targeting technologies provides a unique means of studying the most intimate aspects of countless human diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, the contribution of such engineered models to our current understanding of the pathophysiology, etiology and pathogenesis of PD will be discussed.","Statins have been used for many years for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and are considered to be very safe. Recently, a set of potential new applications was identified for statins. In the future, these drugs could be used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Past studies have suggested a link between AD and lipids and a series of reports has recently been published that significantly tightens this link and also provides some explanations at the cellular level. This review focuses on these recent developments and perspectives that appear to link cholesterol, beta-amyloid and AD.","Autoimmune responses directed against the central nervous system (CNS) have generally been considered pathogenic in nature. Although there are several well understood conditions in which this is the case, there is also a growing body of experimental evidence to show that both the cellular and humoral immune responses can promote tissue repair following CNS injury and disease. Our laboratory has used a mouse model of chronic demyelinating disease to characterize a class of polyreactive IgM autoantibodies that react with oligodendrocyte surface antigens and promote myelin repair. By screening a large number of human monoclonal antibodies, we have found that IgM antibodies that react with CNS tissue are relatively common. Autoreactive IgM antibodies might constitute an endogenous system for tissue repair, and therefore these antibodies could be of value as therapeutic reagents.","Huntington's disease (HD) is one of eight progressive neurodegenerative disorders in which the underlying mutation is a CAG expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract. There are currently no cures or even effective therapies for HD. Effective strategies have remained elusive because little is known about either the mechanisms of expansion or the mechanism of polyglutamine-mediated neuronal death. However, recent advances in understanding the basic mechanisms of expansion and toxicity have renewed hope that a therapeutic strategy might someday be possible. Strategies effective in the treatment of HD are likely to be relevant in the treatment of a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.","The application of modern molecular and cell biology technologies to studies of the neurobiology of aging provides a window on the molecular substrates of successful brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Aging is associated with increased oxidative stress, disturbances in energy metabolism and inflammation-like processes. Dietary restriction (DR) can extend lifespan and might increase the resistance of the nervous system to age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The neuroprotective effect of DR involves a preconditioning response in which the production of neurotrophic factors and protein chaperones is increased resulting in protection against oxyradical production, stabilization of cellular calcium homeostasis, and inhibition of apoptosis. DR might also enhance neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and self-repair mechanisms.","It is widely believed that the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intimately, if not causatively, associated with the deposition of approximately 4 kDa beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of affected individuals. A beta peptides are liberated from transmembrane proteins, termed beta-amyloid precursor proteins (APP), by the concerted action of beta- and gamma-secretase(s). Whereas the identity of beta-secretase is no longer in question, the identity of gamma-secretase, which is responsible for the intramembranous processing of APP, has never been more enigmatic. Considerable evidence has accrued to impugn the presenilins (PS) as the executioners of intramembranous processing of APP. Here, we summarize these observations and review recent evidence that argues against the prevailing hypothesis that PS function as gamma-secretases.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal disease that is characterized by the relentless death of motoneurons. Mutations to Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), though occurring in just 2-3% of individuals with ALS, remain the only proven cause of the disease. These mutations structurally weaken SOD, which indirectly decreases its affinity for Zn. Zn-deficient SOD induces apoptosis in motoneurons through a mechanism involving peroxynitrite. Importantly, Zn-deficient wild-type SOD is just as toxic as Zn-deficient ALS mutant SOD, suggesting that the loss of Zn from wild-type SOD could be involved in the other 98% of cases of ALS. Zn-deficient SOD could therefore be an important therapeutic target in all forms of ALS.",,"Can sensations originating from the internal environment modulate attitude and behaviour? Can the feedback about the operation of the viscera provide a calming and relaxing influence? Information from the chest and abdomen is delivered continuously by the vagus nerve, the largest visceral sensory nerve in the body. Because various 'stress-related' diseases can be associated with impaired functions in sensory vagal fibres, a better understanding of how sensory vagal information is processed in the CNS might offer new strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of several disorders, including 'drug-resistant' forms of eating disorder, anxiety, chronic depression and epilepsy. A neuronal circuitry that has been suggested by experimental data to mediate sensory vagal inputs to those brain areas that are involved in the generation of 'stress-related' disorders is outlined.","A central assumption in neurobiology holds that changes in the strength of individual synapses underlie changes in behavior. This concept is widely accepted in the case of learning and memory where LTP and LTD are the most compelling cellular models. It is therefore of great interest to understand, on a molecular level, how the brain regulates the strength of neuronal connections. We review a large body of evidence in support of the very straightforward regulation of synaptic strength by changing the number of postsynaptic receptors, and discuss the molecular machinery required for insertion and removal of AMPA receptors.","When nerve terminals in the brain are stimulated, a group of phosphoproteins called the dephosphins are coordinately dephosphorylated by calcineurin, the Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase. Amazingly, the seven presently known dephosphins are not structurally related, yet each has been independently shown to be essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE). Nowhere else in biology is there a similar example of the coordinated dephosphorylation of such a large group of proteins each sharing roles in the same biological response. This suggests that dephosphorylation and phosphorylation of the dephosphins is essential for SVE. Recent studies in synaptosomes have confirmed this view, with calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of the dephosphins essential for triggering SVE. The phosphorylation cycle of the dephosphins might regulate SVE by targeting the proteins to sites of action and by stimulating the assembly of several large essential endocytic protein complexes.","Imagine the decisions you might make while playing a simple game like 'matching pennies'. At each play, you and your opponent, say the mathematician John vonNeumann, each lay down a penny heads or tails up. If both pennies show the same side, vonNeumann wins, if not, you win. Before each play, you have the subjective experience of deciding what to do: of choosing whether to play heads or tails. Although decisions like these are not yet understood at a physiological level, progress has been made towards understanding simple decision making in at least one model system: the primate neural architecture that uses visual data and prior knowledge about patterns in the environment to select and execute saccades. Both the visual system and the brainstem circuits that control saccadic eye movements are particularly well understood, making it possible for physiologists to begin to study the connections between these sensory and motor processes at a level of complexity that would be impossible in other less well understood systems.","Although synthetic glucocorticoids are frequently used in hospital for the prevention of chronic lung disease in premature infants, major concern has arisen about the possible long-term consequences of these treatments. Animal research provides evidence for the idea that neonatal glucocorticoid treatment enhances susceptibility to autoimmune disease in adult life. Altered functioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and/or changes at higher brain levels might underlie alterations in disease susceptibility.","The recent demonstration that the fast axonal transport motors kinesin and dynein participate in axonal transport of neurofilaments--known to undergo slow transport--supports and extends recent studies indicating that some neurofilaments exhibit alternating bursts of fast axonal transport interspersed with periods of non-motility. In addition, these findings unify both certain aspects of axonal transport and neurofilament biology. We discuss these data herein in the context of both older and more recent studies of neurofilament dynamics.","The tiny nerve terminals of central synapses contain far fewer vesicles than preparations commonly used for analysis of neurosecretion. Photoconversion of vesicles rendered fluorescent with the dye FM1-43 directly identified vesicles capable of engaging in exo-endocytotic recycling following stimulated Ca(2+) entry. This recycling pool typically contained 30-45 vesicles, only a minority fraction (15-20% on average) of the total vesicle population. The smallness of the recycling pool would severely constrain rates of quantal neurotransmission if classical pathways were solely responsible for vesicle recycling. Fortunately, vesicles can undergo rapid retrieval and reuse in addition to conventional slow recycling, to the benefit of synaptic information flow and neuronal signaling.",,,"Circadian clocks run too fast or too slow relative to the 24-hr period of the solar day. For this reason, biological pacemakers rely on the cyclic nature of the environment to entrain their oscillations. Such environmental cues, when used as a reference for the time of day, are called Zeitgebers or time givers, and an understanding of how such cues impinge on the circadian pacemaker is crucial for our understanding of biological timekeeping.","Reliable neurotransmitter release requires an adequate pool of synaptic vesicles. These pools are maintained by the process of endocytosis. A recent paper revealed that dynamin, a GTPase essential for endocytosis, is regulated by Abnormal wing disc (Awd), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase which converts nucleoside diphosphates to nucleoside triphosphates. This finding suggests that access to GTP directly regulates endocytosis. In addition, awd is homologous to the tumor suppressor gene nm23, further suggesting that dynamin might be involved in tumorigenesis.",Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters are regulators of extracellular transmitter levels in brain and are the primary sites of action for several drugs of abuse and therapy. Studies are beginning to reveal how neurons use synaptic machinery to modulate these regulators.,"The recently defined role for local protein synthesis during long-lasting synaptic plasticity has focused attention on the mechanisms underlying dendritic mRNA localization. The mRNA encoded by the immediate-early gene Arc is not only transported into dendrites, but localizes specifically to activated postsynaptic sites. This specific localization has now been shown to depend on local signaling through the NMDA receptor.","Over the past few years, the classic idea that no new nerve cells are born in the adult mammalian brain has finally and conclusively been refuted by the scientific community. Yet, the first indications that neurogenesis occurs in the brain of adult mammals were obtained using light and electron microscopy over two decades ago. Why this went unrecognized is described in a personal account by the researcher who pioneered those studies: Michael Kaplan.","In most birds and mammals, young are raised in family groups. The phenotypes of nestmates and parents are thus reliable cues for recognition of conspecifics and kin. However, in some species, young develop alone, or in broods of mixed relatedness (e.g. because of multiple paternity or maternity), or among heterospecifics or unrelated conspecifics (brood parasites). Under these circumstances, the best referent (model) for discriminating close from distant kin and heterospecifics from conspecifics might be one's own self. This recognition process is known as self-referent phenotype matching. Here we review recent experimental evidence of self-referencing and suggest that behavioral neuroscience can provide new tools and insights into how it works (its proximate mechanistic and ontogenetic bases) and why it exists (its adaptive significance).","Considerable evidence, including recent direct observations, suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores in neurons, glia, and other cell types, consists of spatially-distinct compartments that can be individually loaded and unloaded. In addition, sub-plasmalemmal ('junctional') components of the ER (jER) are functionally coupled to the overlying plasmalemmal (PL) microdomains in PL-jER units named 'PLasmERosomes'. The PL microdomains and the jER contain clusters of specific transport proteins that regulate Na(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations in the tiny cytosolic space between the PL and jER. This organization helps the ER to produce the many types of complex local and global Ca(2+) signals that are responsible for the simultaneous control of numerous neuronal and glial functions.","High-frequency synchronous activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex and thalamus is a concomitant of discrete conscious events. In the primate thalamus, a newly identified population of neurons provides a basis for this synchronization. A matrix of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons extends throughout the thalamus and projects to superficial layers of cortex over wide areas, unconstrained by boundaries between areas. In some nuclei, a core of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons is superimposed upon the matrix. Core neurons project in a topographically ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. Matrix neurons, recruited by corticothalamic connections, can disperse activity across cortical areas and thalamic nuclei. Their superficial terminations can synchronize specific and nonspecific elements of the thalamocortical network in coherent activity that underlies cognitive events.","A major portion of the primary somatosensory cortex of rodents is characterized by the discrete and patterned distribution of thalamocortical axons and layer IV granule cells ('barrels'), which correspond to the spatial distribution of whiskers and sinus hairs on the snout. In recent years several mutant mouse models began unveiling the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these patterns emerge presynaptically and are reflected postsynaptically. Neural activity plays a crucial role in conferring presynaptic patterns to postsynaptic cells via neurotransmitter receptor-mediated intracellular signals. Here we review recent evidence that is finally opening the doors to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pattern formation in the neocortex.","The brain has the highest metabolic rate of all organs and depends predominantly on oxidative metabolism as a source of energy. Oxidative metabolism generates reactive oxygen species, which can damage all cellular components, including protein, lipids and nucleic acids. The processes of DNA repair normally remove spontaneous gene damage with few errors. However, cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion leads to elevated oxidative stress and damage to genes in brain tissue despite a functional mechanism of DNA repair. These critical events occur at the same time as the expression of immediate early genes, the products of which trans-activate late effector genes that are important for sustaining neuronal viability. These findings open the possibility of applying genetic tools to identify molecular mechanisms of gene repair and to derive new therapies for stroke and brain injury.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Feb;25(2):77-8.,"Glucose has long been considered the substrate for neuronal energy metabolism in the brain. Recently, an alternative explanation of energy metabolism in the active brain, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis, has received attention. It suggests that during neural activity energy needs in glia are met by anaerobic glycolysis, whereas neuronal metabolism is fueled by lactate released from glia. In this article, we critically examine the evidence supporting this hypothesis and explain, from the perspective of enzyme kinetics and substrate availability, why neurons probably use ambient glucose, and not glial-derived lactate, as the major substrate during activity.","Sharing scientific data containing complex information requires new concepts and new technology. NEUROGENERATOR is a database generator for the neuroimaging community. A database generator is a database that generates new databases. The scientists submit raw PET and fMRI data to NEUROGENERATOR, which then processes the data in a uniform way to create databases of homogeneous data suitable for data sharing, met-analysis and modelling the human brain at the systems level. These databases are then distributed to the scientists.","In a recent breakthrough, a methodology has been developed for studying persistent enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in primary cultures of hippocampus. Results from the use of this method have already pointed to a previously unsuspected differential role for synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in lasting synaptic potentiation.","The majority of Alzheimer's disease is inherited in a complex manner involving environmental factors and several genes. One of these genes is Apolipoprotein E where the polymorphic allele (APOE epsilon 4) has been robustly shown to modify risk and the course of Alzheimer's disease. The epsilon 4 allele however, only accounts for approximately 50% of late onset Alzheimer's disease. Here we review three quite different approaches that have led to convincing evidence that there is at least one other susceptibility gene for complex inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease on chromosome 10q. Two linkage studies give strong evidence of a locus at almost exactly the same location: one using the amyloid beta brain-deposited fragment of the amyloid precursor protein as a continuous phenotype, and the other using a categorical disease phenotype. A third candidate gene linkage and association analysis approach interestingly finds a maximum signal approximately 35-60cM distal to the previous studies.","Vertebrates have ribbon synapses in the retina and in other sensory structures that are specialized for rapid, tonic release of synaptic vesicles (1). The lamellar sheets of the ribbon situated at right angles to the plasma membrane are lined with synaptic vesicles that undergo exocytosis under the influence of Ca(2+). Synaptic ribbons act as a conveyer belt to accelerate the release of this ready supply of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic membranes. Although the protein composition of the terminals of ribbon synapses is generally similar to that of ordinary synapses in nervous tissue, much less is known about the composition of the ribbons themselves. RIM, a universal component of presynaptic active zones that interacts with rab3 on the synaptic vesicle, has been localized to the ribbons (2). In addition, the kinesin motor protein, KIF3A, is associated with the ribbons and other organelles in presynaptic nerve terminals (3). Recently, an approximately 120 kDa protein called RIBEYE has been identified in purified ribbons of bovine retina. The RIBEYE cDNA was cloned and its gene identified in the database.","Glutamate neurotransmission is an essential component of many forms of neuronal plasticity, however, the intracellular mechanisms that mediate plasticity are only beginning to be elucidated. The emerging image of the NMDA receptor complex reminds us that the similarity between mechanisms of plasticity in various model systems is greater than their apparent differences. For example, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signalling pathway is crucial for plasticity in a variety of neuronal systems and across a wide variety of species.","Recent anatomical and behavioral data show the expression of G-protein coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors in the periphery on nociceptive primary afferent nerve terminals, and provide evidence for a functional role of peripheral metabotropic glutamate receptors in inflammatory pain. These findings have important implications for new therapeutic strategies that target peripheral metabotropic glutamate receptors for pain relief. They also alert us to the necessity of assessing drug effects at different levels of the nervous system: peripheral and central.","Olfaction involves pattern recognition processes: in the olfactory bulb each odor is represented as a specific spatial activity pattern, serving as the basis for downstream spatiotemporal encoding and odor perception. The principle of pattern generation, the general properties of the patterns and new evidence regarding the functions of the patterns are discussed.",,"Pavlovian fear conditioning has emerged as a leading behavioral paradigm for studying the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the neural substrates of fear conditioning at the systems level, until recently little has been learned about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The success of systems-level work aimed at defining the neuroanatomical pathways underlying fear conditioning, combined with the knowledge accumulated by studies of long-term potentiation (LTP), has recently given way to new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie acquisition and consolidation of fear memories. Collectively, these findings suggest that fear memory consolidation in the amygdala shares essential biochemical features with LTP, and hold promise for understanding the relationship between memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain.","Tackling neurodegenerative diseases represents a formidable challenge for our ageing society. Recently, major achievements have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for such diseases, and, simultaneously, numerous proteins such as neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic or anti-oxidant have been identified as potential therapeutic agents. Although many neurotrophic factors have been tested on individuals suffering from various neurodegenerative disorders, to date none has shown efficacy. Inadequate protein delivery is believed to be part of the problem. Recent improvements in pump technology, as well as in cell and gene therapy, are providing innovative ways to allow localized, regulatable delivery of proteins in brain parenchyma, opening new avenues for clinical trials in the not so distant future.","The neurobiology of schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Symptoms of schizophrenia are classically thought to be associated with an imbalance of the dopaminergic system. However, the contribution of other neurotransmitters, in particular glutamate, has been increasingly appreciated. The role of individual components of neurotransmitter systems in aberrant behaviors can be experimentally tested in transgenic animals. Dopamine transporter knockout mice display persistently elevated dopaminergic tone and therefore might be appropriate substrates to evaluate the dopamine hypothesis. Similarly, NMDA receptor-deficient mice can be used to evaluate the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. In this review we discuss how such animal models might be relevant for understanding the neurochemical underpinnings of certain manifestations of schizophrenia.",Analysis of the Kv3 subfamily of K(+) channel subunits has lead to the discovery of a new class of neuronal voltage-gated K(+) channels characterized by positively shifted voltage dependencies and very fast deactivation rates. These properties are adaptations that allow these channels to produce currents that can specifically enable fast repolarization of action potentials without compromising spike initiation or height. The short spike duration and the rapid deactivation of the Kv3 currents after spike repolarization maximize the quick recovery of resting conditions after an action potential. Several neurons in the mammalian CNS have incorporated into their repertoire of voltage-dependent conductances a relatively large number of Kv3 channels to enable repetitive firing at high frequencies - an ability that crucially depends on the special properties of Kv3 channels and their impact on excitability.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Sep;24(9):515-6.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Sep;24(9):515-6.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Sep;24(9):513-5.,,A recent study has identified the B-Raf gene as essential for the survival of explanted sensory and motor neurons in culture in response to neurotrophic factors. This finding sheds new light on the control of neuronal development and poses new questions with regard to Raf-isozyme-specific functions.,"Central processing of olfactory information has been analyzed in the mushroom body of Drosophila by Ca(2+) imaging, extending such analysis of odor coding to the second relay of the olfactory system. Different odors, and different concentrations of a particular odor, yield distinct spatial patterns of activity. Mutations that affect odor receptors and odorant-binding proteins affect these spatial patterns.","A recent study has shown that mice containing a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding galanin exhibit decreased peripheral nerve regeneration after a lesion. This major advance indicates, for the first time, that the large increases in galanin expression that occur in axotomized peripheral neurons have functional consequences for regeneration. Hopefully, similar functional consequences will soon be found for other peptides induced in these neurons after axotomy, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide.","Notch receptors play crucial roles in many cellular differentiation programs. In addition to a more classical role for Notch in keeping cells in an undifferentiated state, a recent paper has provided clear evidence that Notch signaling is a powerful means of turning adult CNS precursor cells into astrocytes. This work, combined with other reports from the developing CNS, retina and the PNS, demonstrates a role for Notch in gliogenesis. These findings can also be linked to novel insights into the function of proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins in astrocytic differentiation.","The LIS1 gene was cloned following the study of children with lissencephaly and cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome 17p, however, the role of the LIS1 protein in normal cortical development is not precisely defined. LIS1 is a component of evolutionarily conserved intracellular multiprotein complexes and recent literature shows that these complexes are essential, not only for neuronal migration, but they might also be fundamental components of the machinery for cell proliferation and intracellular transport.",,,,,"The level of cellular and molecular complexity of the nervous system creates unique problems for the neuroscientist in the design and implementation of functional genomic studies. Microarray technologies can be powerful, with limitations, when applied to the analysis of human brain disorders. Recently, using cDNA microarrays, altered gene expression patterns between subjects with schizophrenia and controls were shown. Functional data mining led to two novel discoveries: a consistent decrease in the group of transcripts encoding proteins that regulate presynaptic function; and the most changed gene, which has never been previously associated with schizophrenia, regulator of G-protein signaling 4. From these and other findings, a hypothesis has been formulated to suggest that schizophrenia is a disease of the synapse. In the context of a neurodevelopmental model, it is proposed that impaired mechanics of synaptic transmission in specific neural circuits during childhood and adolescence ultimately results in altered synapse formation or pruning, or both, which manifest in the clinical onset of the disease.","An important aspect of Na+ channel regulation is their distribution on neuronal membranes within the nervous system. The complexity of this process is brought by the molecular diversity of Na+ channels and differential regulation of their distribution. In addition, Na+ channel localization is a highly dynamic process depending on the status of the cell in vitro, and (patho)physiological condition of the organism in vivo. Nonetheless, the pharmacological manipulation of Na+ channel distribution should be possible and will hopefully bring safer and more-potent medicines in the future.","In all mammalian species, breathing is controlled by a neuronal network within the lower brainstem. A component known as the ventral respiratory group produces rhythmic activity, which is transmitted to spinal motoneurons to produce a periodic contraction of respiratory muscles. A dispute about the mechanisms of 'normal' respiratory rhythm generation arose from the differences between experimental preparations that have been used to dissect the process. It is, therefore, essential to compare the various experimental approaches and to discuss the differences between experimental data. We conclude that the various preparations all have great value, but that they define different operational conditions of the network, including maturation of neurons and synaptic processes. We have taken note of these in formulating a 'maturational network-burster model' for rhythm generation that includes most features of the existing models of respiratory rhythm generation.","Stimulus-specific persistent neural activity is the neural process underlying active (working) memory. Since its discovery 30 years ago, mnemonic activity has been hypothesized to be sustained by synaptic reverberation in a recurrent circuit. Recently, experimental and modeling work has begun to test the reverberation hypothesis at the cellular level. Moreover, theory has been developed to describe memory storage of an analog stimulus (such as spatial location or eye position), in terms of continuous 'bump attractors' and 'line attractors'. This review summarizes new studies, and discusses insights and predictions from biophysically based models. The stability of a working memory network is recognized as a serious problem; stability can be achieved if reverberation is largely mediated by NMDA receptors at recurrent synapses.","Pain is classically viewed as being mediated solely by neurons, as are other sensory phenomena. The discovery that spinal cord glia (microglia and astrocytes) amplify pain requires a change in this view. These glia express characteristics in common with immune cells in that they respond to viruses and bacteria, releasing proinflammatory cytokines, which create pathological pain. These spinal cord glia also become activated by certain sensory signals arriving from the periphery. Similar to spinal infection, these signals cause release of proinflammatory cytokines, thus creating pathological pain. Taken together, these findings suggest a new, dramatically different approach to pain control, as all clinical therapies are focused exclusively on altering neuronal, rather than glial, function.","Voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are a large family of related heterooligomers that couple cell excitability to intracellular signalling. Recent studies on mice carrying Ca2+ channel mutations, or in which Ca2+ channel subunits have been deleted, have provided important information about the roles carried out by these molecules in cardiovascular function, pain, epilepsy, migraine and deafness, in addition to further defining how Ca2+ channels regulate the physiology of excitable cells.","A key problem in developmental neurobiology is how axons home in on their correct target tissue and establish the correct synaptic contacts. Recent work shows that in the developing Drosophila visual system a population of distinct lamina glial cells ensures correct target layer selection of retinal axons. In the absence of lamina neurons, photoreceptor axons terminate their growth in the correct zone, but when glial cell migration into the lamina is disrupted, as in nonstop mutants, growth cones advance into deeper layers of the brain.","There is new evidence that the brain of developing songbirds can synthesize estradiol de novo. In males, this neurally derived estrogen might masculinize a connection within the neural song system. These results challenge traditional concepts about mechanisms of brain sexual differentiation and reveal a significant function for neurosteroids.","Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFL) are potent survival factors and regulators for central and peripheral neurons. GFLs bind to specific glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptors (GFRalpha1-alpha4), but signal through a common c-Ret receptor. Both GPI-anchored and soluble GFRalpha1 recruit c-Ret to lipid rafts following GDNF stimulation, where c-Ret interacts with different proteins than outside the rafts. Soluble GFRalpha1 mobilizes c-Ret to rafts by a different mechanism compared with GPI-anchored GFRalpha1.",,,"Increasing evidence points to the importance of intrinsic molecular cues in specifying the regional identity of mammalian neocortex. Few such cues, however, have been found to be restricted to individual functionally defined cortical areas before the arrival of afferent information. In contrast, thalamocortical axons are specifically targeted to individual cortical areas, raising the possibility that they can instruct some aspects of cortical areal identity. Cortical structure and function can be altered by modifying the source or pattern of activity in thalamocortical afferents. In particular, studies of cross-modal plasticity have shown that in many respects, one sensory cortical area can substitute for another after a switch of input modality during development. Afferent inputs might therefore direct the formation of their own processing circuitry, a possibility that has important implications for brain development, plasticity and evolution.","Neurological disorders represent one of the most common disturbances accompanying HIV infection. In the past few years, highly antiretroviral active therapy has significantly reduced the incidence of HIV-related diseases. However, neurological dysfunction in AIDS patients still remains an unresolved problem. Oxidative stress, which occurs in brain tissues of patients undergoing HIV infection and is implicated in cell death of both astroglia and neurones, has recently been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS. Thus, a better understanding of the processes that trigger and modulate free radical formation in brain tissues of AIDS patients might help in a successful therapeutic approach to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection.","The body plan of the tadpole larva of ascidians, or sea-squirts, is widely presumed to be close to that of the hypothetical ancestor of all chordate animal groups, including vertebrates. This is nowhere more obvious than in the organization and development of the dorsal tubular nervous system. Several recent developments advocate this model neural system for studies on neurobiology and neurogenesis. These include advances in our understanding of development in ascidian embryos and of differentiation among the cellular progeny of its neural plate; the application of transgenic and mutant approaches to studies on ascidian larval neurones; and the prospect of advances in genomic analyses. In addition to providing ways to study a working chordate brain in miniature, all these offer insights into the ancestral condition of the developing vertebrate brain.","Progress in molecular genetics has enabled the dissection of several autosomal dominantly inherited forms of cerebrovascular disorders. Mutations in diverse genes might induce pathological changes in intracranial vessels, resulting in cerebral haemorrhages and ischaemic strokes. Such pathologies, however, might also result from systemic vascular disease caused by mutations or polymorphisms in genes that regulate cardiovascular physiology, blood coagulation, lipid metabolism and metabolic functions. Interestingly, several mutations that directly affect CNS vasculature involve genes that control inter- or intracellular signalling functions. Although highly variable phenotypes make it difficult to pinpoint the genotypes, genetic characterization of cerebrovascular disorders is valuable for understanding the pathogenesis and management of sporadic disease.","Estrogen and progesterone, long considered for their roles as primary hormones in reproductive and maternal behavior, are now being studied as neuroprotective and neuroregenerative agents in stroke and traumatic brain injuries. Collectively, the hormones reduce the consequences of the injury cascade by enhancing anti-oxidant mechanisms, reducing excitotoxicity (altering glutamate receptor activity, reducing immune inflammation, providing neurotrophic support, stimulating axonal remyelinization), and enhancing synaptogenesis and dendritic arborization. Estrogen seems more effective as a prophylactic treatment in females at risk for cardiac and ischemic brain injury, whereas progesterone appears to be more helpful in the post-injury treatment of both male and female subjects with acute traumatic brain damage. However, a recent clinical trial with estradiol replacement therapy in elderly women that have a history of cerebrovascular disease, showed that this hormone was unable to protect against reoccurrence of ischemia or to reduce the incidence of mortality compared to a placebo.","Synaptic efficacy can increase (synaptic facilitation) or decrease (synaptic depression) markedly within milliseconds after the onset of specific temporal patterns of activity. Recent evidence suggests that short-term synaptic depression contributes to low-pass temporal filtering, and can account for a well-known paradox - many low-pass neurons respond vigorously to transients and the onsets of high temporal-frequency stimuli. The use of depression for low-pass filtering, however, is itself a paradox; depression induced by ongoing high-temporal frequency stimuli could preclude desired responses to low-temporal frequency information. This problem can be circumvented, however, by activation of short-term synaptic facilitation that maintains responses to low-temporal frequency information. Such short-term plasticity might also contribute to spatio-temporal processing.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2001 Aug;24(8):488.,"Although sequencing of the human genome has been taking place in rapidly accelerating fashion for years, the presentation of the entire sequence (to a first approximation, anyway) has now permitted a global view of its structure. The completion of the sequence has therefore invited all manner of aesthetic, philosophical, societal - as well as biological - discussions of its implications. This global view of the genome will undoubtedly forever change the face of biology. But how? Here are a few perspectives from the point of view of neuroscience.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Oct;24(10):570-2.,"During development, when synapses start to be established, a primitive form of network-driven activity provides most of the synaptic activity. This pattern enables a high degree of synchrony in immature neurons in spite of the small number of functional synapses and could participate in activity-dependent growth and synapse formation. Relying on the giant depolarizing potentials that provide most of the synaptic activity in the developing hippocampus, this article reviews the common properties and generating mechanisms of these patterns, and particularly the role of the early depolarizing action of GABA(A) and glycine receptors and the sequential expression of GABA and glutamate synapses. Patterns similar to giant depolarizing potentials have been observed in a wide range of structures and species suggesting that there is a temporal template throughout evolution that constitutes an essential step in the formation of functional networks.","Increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we will focus on progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare parkinsonian disorder with tau pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the genetic and biochemical data that has emerged, offering new perspectives into the pathogenesis of this devastating disease, especially the contributory roles of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.","Mammalian 2P domain K(+) channels are responsible for background or 'leak' K(+) currents. These channels are regulated by various physical and chemical stimuli, including membrane stretch, temperature, acidosis, lipids and inhalational anaesthetics. Furthermore, channel activity is tightly controlled by membrane receptor stimulation and second messenger phosphorylation pathways. Several members of this novel family of K(+) channels are highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in which they are proposed to play an important physiological role. The pharmacological modulation of this novel class of ion channels could be of interest for both general anaesthesia and ischaemic neuroprotection.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Jun;25(6):293; author reply 294.,"Non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine, ketamine and MK801, produce psychosis in humans. These drugs also produce injury to cingulate-retrosplenial cortex in adult rodents that can be prevented by GABA-receptor agonists and antipsychotics such as haloperidol and clozapine. MK801 injections into anterior thalamus reproduce limbic cortex injury, and GABA-receptor agonist injections into anterior thalamus prevent injury produced by systemic MK801. Inhibition of NMDA receptors on GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus neurons might activate thalamocortical 'injury' circuits in animals. Pathological activation of thalamocortical circuits might also mediate the psychosis produced by NMDA-receptor antagonists in humans, and might contribute to psychosis in schizophrenia.","Most contemporary theories of memory are based on the assumption that memory can be divided into multiple psychological systems that are subserved by different neural substrates and that contribute to performance in a relatively independent manner. Although the study of individual memory systems has proved to be enormously useful, recent data increasingly point towards complex interactions between memory systems during performance of any given memory task. Three basic classes of interactions between different memory systems (competition, synergism and independence) are presented that appear to be congruent with the findings of many behavioral studies. Consideration of interactions among multiple memory systems will enhance our current understanding of memory by encouraging the view that memory systems are dynamic interactive units, rather than independent modules that act in isolation.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2002 Jan;25(1):20-1.,To cross or not to cross the midline? This is the question that pathfinding axons in the developing CNS must answer. In the past few years the molecular mechanisms involved in this decision process have been determined for neurones. A recent paper now shows that glia are also affected by these same mechanisms and that the presence of glia can tip the balance in favour of repulsion or attraction of neurones to the midline.,"Presentation of auditory stimuli to sleeping subjects produced distinct fMRI activation patterns. Whereas pure tones activated auditory processing regions, subjects' names additionally activated language centers as well as the left amygdala and prefrontal cortex. These studies open the way for crucial studies of sleep-dependent cognitive processing.","Studies in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease suggest the potential for vaccine development for this disease. Specifically, inoculation with Abeta peptide reduces Abeta plaque formation. However, this vaccination strategy has raised safety concerns. Recent studies have reduced these concerns by demonstrating that long-term Abeta vaccination in transgenic mice does not produce detrimental behavioral effects and in fact appears to protect against age-related functional decline in spatial memory tasks.","The processing of visual information combines bottom-up sensory aspects with top-down influences, most notably attentional processes. Attentional influences have now been demonstrated throughout visual cortex, and their influence on the processing of visual information is profound. Neuronal responses to attended locations or stimulus features are enhanced, whereas those from unattended locations or features are suppressed. This influence of attention increases as one ascends the hierarchy of visual areas in primate cortex, ultimately resulting in a neural representation of the visual world that is dominated by the behavioral relevance of the information, rather than designed to provide an accurate and complete description of it. This realization has led to a rethinking of the role of areas that have previously been considered to be ""purely sensory"".","As a rat navigates through space, neurons called head-direction (HD) cells provide a signal of the rat's momentary directional heading. Although partly guided by landmarks, the cells also show a remarkable ability to track directional heading based on angular head movement. Theoretical models suggest that the HD cells are linked together to form an attractor network, and that cells which signal angular velocity update the directional setting of the attractor. Recently, cell types similar to those required theoretically have been discovered in the lateral mammillary and dorsal tegmental nuclei. Lesion and anatomical data suggest these nuclei might constitute the postulated attractor-path integration mechanism, and that they provide the HD cell signal to cortical areas where it has been observed.","The everyday auditory environment consists of multiple simultaneously active sources with overlapping temporal and spectral acoustic properties. Despite the seemingly chaotic composite signal impinging on our ears, the resulting perception is of an orderly ""auditory scene"" that is organized according to sources and auditory events, allowing us to select messages easily, recognize familiar sound patterns, and distinguish deviant or novel ones. Recent data suggest that these perceptual achievements are mainly based on processes of a cognitive nature (""sensory intelligence"") in the auditory cortex. Even higher cognitive processes than previously thought, such as those that organize the auditory input, extract the common invariant patterns shared by a number of acoustically varying sounds, or anticipate the auditory events of the immediate future, occur at the level of sensory cortex (even when attention is not directed towards the sensory input).","The molecular nature of the metabotropic GABA(B) receptor was for some time a mystery, however it was recently discovered that two related G-protein-coupled receptors have to heterodimerize to form the functional GABA(B) receptor at the cell surface. This review discusses the most recent findings in the rapidly expanding field of GABA(B) receptor research, and includes a summary of all splice variants of both receptor subunits identified to date. It also evaluates emerging evidence that certain splice variants might play a role in determining pharmacologically distinguishable receptors, and reviews receptor localization at the sub-cellular level and involvement in neuronal development.","The Ca2+ store and sink in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is important for Ca2+ signal integration and for conveyance of information in spatial and temporal domains. Textbooks regard the ER as one continuous network, but biochemical and biophysical studies revealed apparently discrete ER Ca2+ stores. Recent direct studies of ER lumenal Ca2+ movements show that this organelle system is one continuous Ca2+ store, which can function as a Ca2+ tunnel. The concept of a fully connected ER network is entirely compatible with evidence indicating that the distribution of Ca2+ -release channels in the ER membrane is discontinuous with clustering in certain localities.","The possibility that spreading depression (SD) of cortical activity, a phenomenon observed in all vertebrates, causes the aura of migraine remains an open question in spite of nearly half a century of investigation. SD is also thought to be associated with the progressive neuronal injury observed during cerebral ischaemia. Thus, the ability to detect and investigate SD in humans might prove clinically significant. Animal studies of cortical spreading depression (CSD) have benefited greatly from the advent of relatively non-invasive imaging techniques. The use of these new imaging techniques for clinical studies will accelerate progress in this area of neurobiology.","The recent success of large-scale industrialized genomic sequencing opens new doors in studies of biological systems. In the current post-genomic era we must ask how to translate this DNA sequence information into an understanding of living cells, tissues and organisms. One of the major goals is to characterize protein function, biochemical pathways and networks. Achieving this aim is greatly advanced by application of new proteomic tools combined with database mining. Neuroscience in particular is poised to benefit from these approaches in light of its high complexity and cross-talk between different neurotransmitter receptors within the same synapse or across the synaptic cleft. Little is known about the global in vivo protein interactions within synapses, and the knowledge of all proteins present in such structures will help in determining sub-complexes and the modular arrangement of proteins within them. This article reviews the impact of and outlines the application of proteomic analysis in the field of neuroscience, illustrating this with the example of NMDA receptor complexes.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2001 Jul;24(7):385.,"Unlike most mammals, most cones in house mouse retina express two opsins, one sensitive to UV-light, and another sensitive to middle-wavelengths. Is the mouse unique, having a single cone type that normally expresses two opsins? Or is the mouse a typical mammal having two cone types, but a species wide mutation results in co-expression of two opsins?","Selective nigral degeneration with inclusion formation provoked by systemic administration of the herbicide rotenone, through inhibition of complex I, raises the question of pesticide exposure and environmental factors in general, as a cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Toxin-induced complex I inhibition probably represents one of many potential causes of PD, but it alerts us to the dangers of such substances in the environment and the need to identify genetically susceptible populations. When vulnerable individuals become known, perhaps they should stay out of the garden.","This review synthesizes data from behavioral studies examining the role of sleep in memory storage with what is known about the molecular mechanisms of memory consolidation. There are striking similarities in the effects on memory storage of post-training pharmacological manipulations and post-training manipulations of sleep. For example, inhibition of protein synthesis is most effective if it occurs at a time post-training when rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is required for memory consolidation. The neurochemical changes that occur across sleep/wake states, especially the cholinergic changes that occur in the hippocampus during REM sleep, might provide a mechanism by which sleep modulates specific cellular signaling pathways involved in hippocampus-dependent memory storage.","The ""orphan"" G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cloned GPCRs that bind unknown ligands. Since 1995, nineteen orphan GPCRs have been used as targets to identify and isolate their natural ligands via the application of the ""orphan receptor strategy"". These ligands are peptides, lipids or biogenic amines, and act as transmitter molecules. One nucleotide-sugar derivative and six peptides or peptide families identified through this strategy are novel and have already enriched our understanding of various brain functions.","Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of CNS axons, are highly vulnerable to excitotoxic signals mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA and kainate classes. Receptors in these cells are commonly activated by glutamate that is released from axons and glial cells. In addition, oligodendrocytes contribute to the control of extracellular glutamate levels by means of their own transporters. However, acute and chronic alterations in glutamate homeostasis can result in overactivation of AMPA and kainate receptors and subsequent excitotoxic oligodendroglial death. Furthermore, demyelinating lesions caused by excitotoxins can be similar to those observed in multiple sclerosis. This, together with the effect of AMPA and kainate receptor antagonists in ameliorating the neurological score of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis), indicates that oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity could be involved in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disorders.","Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a small self-aggregating peptide produced at low levels by normal brain metabolism. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), self-aggregation of Abeta becomes rampant, manifested most strikingly as the amyloid fibrils of senile plaques. Because fibrils can kill neurons in culture, it has been argued that fibrils initiate the neurodegenerative cascades of AD. An emerging and different view, however, is that fibrils are not the only toxic form of Abeta, and perhaps not the neurotoxin that is most relevant to AD: small oligomers and protofibrils also have potent neurological activity. Immuno-neutralization of soluble Abeta-derived toxins might be the key to optimizing AD vaccines that are now on the horizon.","RNA interference (RNAi), one of the hottest topics of molecular biology research today, has unique features that are eerily reminiscent of the phenomenon of ""RNA-mediated memory transfer,"" a controversial line of work that was investigated with great enthusiasm in the 1960s. If not a coincidence, then this suggests taking a new look at RNA-mediated modulation of neural function and raises the possibility that RNAi might be one of the physiologic mechanisms that regulate long-term gene expression in the brain.","Accumulating evidence indicates that nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the function of monoamine transporters. Because the production of NO by neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) is closely related to the activation of NMDA receptors, the level of NO around nNOS-containing synapses reflects the activity of glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. Glutamate participates mainly in synaptic interactions, but with the help of NO, the strength of excitatory input might be nonsynaptically signaled to the surrounding monoaminergic neurons, which can adapt to the changes without receiving glutamatergic input and without synthesizing glutamate receptors. Thus, the effect of NO on transporters represents a new form of interneuronal communication, a nonsynaptic interaction without receptors.","Rodents used in biomedical research are typically reared in small cages that lack key features of their natural habitats. These conditions impose constraints on behaviour and brain development, resulting in altered brain functions. In this article, evidence for three different ways in which barren housing conditions interfere with brain development and behaviour is reviewed. Early environmental deprivation, thwarting of behavioral response rules, and disruption of habitat-dependent adaptation processes are shown to result in aberrant or maladaptive brain functions. Current standard housing conditions could therefore compromise the utility of rodents for research, especially in behavioural neuroscience. However, a better understanding of the animals' needs and of the environmental factors involved in the control of behaviour could offer a biological basis for refinement.","Nearly 30 years ago, a debate over two disparate models of synaptic vesicle retrieval arose. Subsequent investigations to determine which model was correct proved inconclusive and served only to further the debate. However, recent evidence has begun to suggest that both models are valid and relevant in understanding the complex nature of vesicle recycling.","Lipoprotein receptors were originally considered simply as cellular transporters for cholesterol and other lipids. This view is rapidly changing. Signaling functions have recently been recognized in several members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family. These Apolipoprotein E receptors are highly expressed in the developing and in the mature nervous system, in which they regulate crucial developmental processes and might also participate in synaptic neurotransmission.","Chemosensory neurons in the mammalian nose detect an array of odors and pheromones that carry essential information about the animal's environment. How the nose organizes this immense amount of information is a major question in sensory biology. New evidence suggests that there are several subpopulations of sensory neurons in the nose that project to different areas in the forebrain. Strikingly, evidence is now emerging that several of these neuronal subpopulations employ distinct second messenger cascades to transduce chemical stimuli. This new understanding of the heterogeneity of chemosensory transduction mechanisms offers the opportunity to use genetically altered animals to specifically target these subpopulations. Such approaches should enable researchers to examine the role that each of these subsystems could play in chemosensory-dependent behaviors.",,,"Huntington's disease is characterized by a loss of brain striatal neurons that occurs as a consequence of an expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin protein. The resulting extended polyglutamine stretch confers a deleterious gain-of-function to the protein. Analysis of the mutant protein has attracted most of the research activity in the field, however re-examination of earlier data and new results on the beneficial functions of normal huntingtin indicate that loss of the normal protein function might actually equally contribute to the pathology. Thus, complete elucidation of the physiological role(s) of huntingtin and its mode of action are essential and could lead to new therapeutic approaches.","The fast inactivation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels is a key mechanism that contributes to the precise control of Ca(2+) entry into excitable cells. Recent advances have revealed that multiple structural elements contribute to the intrinsic inactivation properties of the alpha(1) subunit, including its cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions. Another major determinant of Ca(2+) channel inactivation is the association with one of four types of ancillary beta subunits that differentially modulate the intrinsic inactivation properties of the alpha(1) subunit. This could occur partly via interactions with the N-terminal region of the alpha(1) subunit and through lipid modification of the beta subunit. However, the latest findings suggest a mechanism in which fast Ca(2+) channel inactivation could occur through physical occlusion of the pore of the channel in a manner reminiscent of Na(+) and K(+) channel inactivation.","Sound stimuli are detected in the cochlea by vibration of hair bundles on sensory hair cells, which activates mechanotransducer ion channels and generates an electrical signal. Remarkably, the process can also work in reverse with additional force being produced by the ion channels as they open and close, evoking active movements of the hair bundle. These movements could supplement the energy of the sound stimuli but to be effective they would need to be very fast. New measurements in the turtle ear have shown that such active bundle movements occur with delays of less than a millisecond, and are triggered by the entry of Ca(2+) into the cell via the mechanotransducer channel. Furthermore, their speed depends on the frequency to which the hair cell is most sensitive, suggesting that such movements could be important in cochlear amplification and frequency discrimination.","Retroviruses represent an important group of RNA viruses that cause a spectrum of nervous system diseases. Furthermore, newly recognized retroviral infections of the nervous system and some retroviral vectors or proteins used for gene delivery raise potential safety concerns. This article highlights different retroviruses and their causative mechanisms of nervous system disease, or neurovirulence. Specific sequences within retroviral genes might determine the development of neurovirulence. Conversely, neurovirulent retroviruses also activate host immune responses, resulting in a neuropathogenic cascade that is mediated by pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic molecules, ultimately culminating in neuronal death. Thus, retroviral infections of the nervous system illustrate a molecular interplay between distinct infectious agents and pathogenic host responses, which results in neurovirulence.","GABA-mediated transmission is characterized by high variability of synaptic responses. Major contributors to this variability are: presynaptic factors, including release probability and number of release sites; factors that determine synaptic GABA transients in the cleft, including diffusion and the actions of GABA transporters; and postsynaptic factors, including GABA(A) receptors subtypes, their location and number, their modulation by endogenous and exogenous factors, and their interactions with postsynaptic-anchoring proteins.","Neuromodulation provides considerable flexibility to the output of neural networks. In spite of the extensive literature documenting the presence of modulatory peptide co-transmitters in many neurons, considerably less is known about the specific roles of co-transmission in circuit function. This review describes some of the potential consequences of peptide co-transmission in functional circuits, using specific examples from recent work on the actions of identified peptidergic projection neurons acting on the multifunctional neural network within the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. This system reveals that co-transmission provides projection neurons with a rich assortment of strategies for eliciting multiple outputs from a multifunctional network.","The function of sleep remains a long-standing mystery in neurobiology. The presence of a sleep-like state has recently been demonstrated in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, meeting the essential behavioral criteria for sleep and also showing pharmacological and molecular correlates of mammalian sleep. This development opens up the possibility of applying genetic analysis to the identification of key molecular components of sleep. A mutant of monoamine metabolism has already been found to affect the homeostatic regulation of sleep-like behavior in the fly. The record of Drosophila in laying the foundations for subsequent studies in mammals argues in favor of the force of this new approach.",Volumetric measurements of the brain regions in eight-year-old children indicate that the poor cognitive and behavioral outcomes noted in ex-preterm neonates are associated with reduced volumes of specific regions in the brain. Recent literature suggests that this reduction might result from enhanced apoptosis or excitotoxic damage to highly susceptible immature neurons.,,,"All thalamic relay cells exhibit two distinct response modes--tonic and burst--that reflect the status of a voltage-dependent, intrinsic membrane conductance. Both response modes efficiently relay information to the cortex in behaving animals, but have markedly different consequences for information processing. The lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex, provides a reasonable model for all of thalamus. Compared with burst mode, geniculate relay cells that are firing in tonic mode exhibit better linear summation, but have poorer detectability for visual stimuli. The switch between the response modes can be controlled by nonretinal, modulatory afferents to these cells, such as the feedback pathway from cortex. This allows the thalamus to provide a dynamic relay that affects the nature and format of information that reaches the cortex.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jun;24(6):316-8.,"Pathfinding by developing axons towards their proper targets is an essential step in establishing appropriate neuronal connections. Recent work involving cell culture assays and molecular biology strategies, including knockout animals, strongly indicates that a complex network of guidance signals regulates the formation of hippocampal connections during development. Outgrowing axons are routed towards the hippocampal formation by specific expression of long-range cues, which include secreted class 3 semaphorins, netrin 1 and Slit proteins. Local membrane- or substrate-anchored molecules, such as ligands of the ephrin A subclass, provide layer-specific positional information. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie axonal guidance during hippocampal development might be of importance in making therapeutic use of sprouting fibers, which are produced following the loss of afferents in CNS lesion.","Notions of what constitutes a neurotransmitter have changed markedly with the advent in the past decade of synaptic molecules, which satisfy key neurotransmitter criteria but differ radically from classical transmitters. Thus, NO and carbon monoxide are neither stored in synaptic vesicles nor released by exocytosis. These gases do not act via traditional receptors on postsynaptic membranes. In addition, zinc, stored together with glutamate in synaptic vesicles, appears to act as an 'antagonist' co-transmitter at the NMDA receptor, and although localized exclusively to glia, D-serine fulfills most neurotransmitter criteria as an endogenous ligand for the 'glycine' site of NMDA receptors.","Stress triggers important adaptive responses that enable an organism to cope with a changing environment. However, when prolonged or repeated, stress can be extremely harmful. The release of catecholamines is a key initial event in responses to stressors and is followed by an increase in the expression of genes that encode catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes. This process is mediated by transcriptional mechanisms in the adrenal medulla and the locus coeruleus. The persistence of transcriptional activation depends on the duration and repetition of the stress. Recent work has begun to identify the various transcription factors that are associated with brief or intermediate duration of a single or repeated stress. These studies suggest that dynamic interplay is involved in converting the transient increases in the rate of transcription into prolonged (potentially adaptive or maladaptive) changes in gene expression.","The word prion has become synonymous with unusual diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, there is also a normal prion protein that does not cause disease. Until recently this highly conserved and widely expressed glycoprotein has been overshadowed by its rogue isoform. Now it is emerging that not only is this protein important for understanding prion disease but it is also important for a healthy brain. The normal cellular isoform of the prion protein is expressed at high levels at synapses suggesting an important role in neuronal function. There is increasing evidence that the normal prion protein binds copper and the resulting complex possesses anti-oxidant activity, and that this, in turn, might have vital implications for synaptic homeostasis.","The NGF family of neurotrophins has a crucial role in regulating neuron numbers during vertebrate development. Six years ago the prediction was made that invertebrates with simple nervous systems, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, would lack neurotrophins. Surprisingly, it now appears that not only C. elegans but also Drosophila melanogaster, lack homologs of the neurotrophins or their trk receptors. Furthermore, functional studies indicate that control of neuronal numbers in Drosophila is primarily dependent on steroids. By contrast, a recognizable trk homolog exists in molluscs, a phylum that includes species with the most complex nervous systems in the invertebrate kingdom. This suggests that neurotrophic signaling mechanisms might be one of the prerequisites for evolution of complex nervous systems. Expansion of the genome projects to other invertebrates, such as molluscs and coelenterates, should provide new insights on the molecular correlates of building complex brains.",,,,,,"A recent series of papers in Nature shows that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family members play a role in transduction of Wnt signals. These findings, in addition to other work from the past two years, have important implications for the role of Wnts in neural development.",,"'Independent component analysis' is a technique of data transformation that finds independent sources of activity in recorded mixtures of sources. It can be used to recover fluctuations of membrane potential from individual neurons in multiple-detector optical recordings. There are some examples in which more than 100 neurons can be separated simultaneously. Independent component analysis automatically separates overlapping action potentials, recovers action potentials of different sizes from the same neuron, removes artifacts and finds the position of each neuron on the detector array. One limitation is that the number of sources--neurons and artifacts--must be equal to or less than the number of simultaneous recordings. Independent component analysis also has many other applications in neuroscience including, removal of artifacts from EEG data, identification of spatially independent brain regions in fMRI recordings and determination of population codes in multi-unit recordings.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jun;24(6):318-9.,"Adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) make up around 5-8% of the glial cell population in the CNS. Their function in the undamaged CNS is largely unknown, but their processes are in contact with nodes of Ranvier and synapses, suggesting a regulatory role at these structures. The cells divide slowly, and constitute approximately 70% of cells labelled following a pulse injection of bromodeoxyuridine. In the injured CNS the cells form a reactive glial population that undergoes hypertrophy and mitosis, probably driven by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In response to demyelination they divide and are thought to differentiate to provide new oligodendrocytes to replace those that have been lost. However, remyelination fails during the later stages of multiple sclerosis, and it is not clear whether this is as a result of a depletion of adult OPCs, inhibition within the glial scar, or damage to the axons that prevents myelination. Adult OPCs are also activated and proliferate following other forms of CNS damage, such as mechanical injury, excitotoxicity and viral infection. The cells produce several of the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans that might inhibit axon regeneration.","The optic tectum differentiates from the alar plate of the mesencephalon. Here, the molecular mechanisms for differentiation of the tectum are reviewed. Mis-expression of Pax2, Pax5 or En can change the fate of the presumptive diencephalon to become the tectum. En, Fgf8, Pax2 and Pax5, exist in a positive feedback loop for their expression so that mis-expression of any of these genes acts on the feedback loop resulting in induction of the optic tectum in the diencephalon. Otx2 and Gbx2 can repress the expression of each other and contribute to the formation of the posterior border of the tectum. Mis-expression of Otx2 in the metencephalon changed the fate of its alar plate to the tectum. The anterior border of the tectum might be determined as a result of repressive interaction of Pax6 with En1 and Pax2. Along the dorsoventral axis of the mesencephalon, Shh contributes to the ventralization of the tissue, that is, the area affected by Shh differentiates into the tegmentum. It is proposed that the brain vesicle that expresses Otx2, Pax2 and En1 might differentiate into the tectum.","Cell-cycle-related proteins, such as cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinases, are re-expressed in neurons committed to death in response to a variety of insults, including excitotoxins, hypoxia and ischemia, loss of trophic support, or beta-amyloid peptide. In some of these conditions events that are typical of the mid-G1 phase, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 activation, are required for the induction of neuronal death. In other cases, the cycle must proceed further and recruit steps that are typical of the G1/S transition for death to occur. Finally, there are conditions in which cell-cycle proteins might be re-expressed, but do not contribute to neuronal death. We hypothesize that cell-cycle signaling becomes a mandatory component of neuronal demise when other mechanisms are not enough for neurons to reach the threshold for death. Under this scheme, the death threshold is set by the extent of DNA damage. Whenever the extent of DNA damage is below this threshold, a cell-cycle signaling becomes crucial for the induction of neuronal death through p53-dependent or -independent pathways.","In addition to synaptically mediated signals that are based on changes in membrane potential, neurons also generate and receive many types of signals that involve biochemical pathways, some of which are independent of voltage. Although networks of biochemical pathways have often been thought of as being only neuromodulatory, recent computational and experimental studies have highlighted how these pathways can also integrate and transfer information themselves. Interactions between biochemical pathways involving positive and negative feedback loops allow biochemical signals to exhibit emergent properties, most notably bistability and oscillations. New and evolving techniques, including real-time imaging of second messengers, hold the promise of illuminating information processing that cannot be detected using microelectrodes, and revealing how 'biochemical integration' might contribute to the computational abilities of the nervous system.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Sep;24(9):504-6.

Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jul;24(7):374-5; author reply 378-80.,,"The neurotrophin hypothesis proposes that neurotrophins participate in activity-induced modification of synaptic transmission. Increasingly, evidence indicates that the synthesis, secretion and actions of neurotrophins on synaptic transmission are regulated by electrical activity and that neurotrophins themselves can acutely modify synaptic efficacy. Neurotrophins appear to exert either a permissive or instructive role on activity-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression, which depends on the particular synaptic connections and developmental stages. The characteristics of synaptic changes that are induced by neurotrophins suggest that this family of proteins is crucial for providing a molecular background in which activity-dependent plasticity can occur at selective synaptic sites within the neural network.","Expression of the genes encoding Reelin and Dab1 during cortical development in turtle, lizard, chick and mammals correlates with architectonic patterns. In all species, Reelin is secreted by marginal zone cells, whereas Dab1, which mediates the response to Reelin, is synthesized by cortical plate neurons. This pattern was presumably present in stem amniotes. In mammals, the cortical plate is radially organized and develops from inside to outside, these features depend on amplification of reelin synthesis in the marginal zone. In lizards, the cortical plate develops from outside to inside, similar to other non-mammals, but is radially organized, with an additional layer of Reelin added in the subcortex. Thus, the Reelin pathway played a key role in cortical architectonic evolution in mammalian and squamate lineages.","Recent studies on Schwann cells at the neuromuscular junction and non-synaptic regions of premyelinated axons indicate that extracellular ATP can act as an activity-dependent signaling molecule in communication between neurons and glia. Several mechanisms have been observed for the regulated release of ATP from synaptic and non-synaptic regions, and a diverse family of receptors for extracellular ATP has been characterized. The findings suggest functional consequences of neuron-glial communication beyond homeostasis of the extracellular environment surrounding neurons, including regulating synaptic strength, gene expression, mitotic rate, and differentiation of glia according to impulse activity in neural circuits.","The cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) has diverse actions in the brain. In normal brain the IL-1 system is expressed at low levels and is upregulated rapidly in response to local or peripheral insults. IL-1 mediates host defence responses to local and systemic disease and injury (e.g. fever, slow-wave sleep, appetite suppression and neuroendocrine responses) and to neuroinflammation and cell death in neurodegenerative conditions, such as stroke and head injury. It has also been implicated in chronic degenerative diseases, in particular, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The mechanisms regulating the expression and action of IL-1 are poorly understood, but involve multiple effects on neuronal, glial and endothelial cell function. Thus, the IL-1 system provides an attractive and intensely competitive target for therapeutic intervention.",Visual areas of the brain must be connected to motor areas for the sensory guidance of movement. The first step in the pathway from the primary visual cortex is by way of the dorsal stream of visual areas in the parietal lobe. The fact that monkeys can still guide their limbs visually after cortico-cortical fibres have been severed suggests that there are subcortical routes that link visual and motor areas of the brain. The pathway that runs from the pons and cerebellum is the largest of these. Pontine cells that receive inputs from visual cortical areas or the superior colliculus respond vigorously to appropriate visual stimuli and project widely on the cerebellar cortex. A challenge for future research is to elucidate the role of these cerebellar target areas in visuo-motor control.,"Serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(3) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which are generally thought to be involved in the presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release. However, analysis of published data reveals that most of the evidence for the alleged presynaptic role of 5-HT(3) receptors in modulating CNS neurotransmitter release is not compelling. Nevertheless, 5-HT(3) receptors are present in nerve terminals from some brain regions. The increased basic knowledge of the cellular physiology of central 5-HT(3) receptor ligand-gated ion channels provides opportunities for a detailed characterization of the specific presynaptic effects of 5-HT(3) receptors. Such reconsideration is required for the full appreciation of the functional role of 5-HT(3) receptors in the CNS.","Genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases are normally expressed throughout neural development and are essential for the elaboration and maintenance of neuronal subpopulations. Disease-causing mutations can compromise defined subsets of these neural specification events in subtle ways that initially lead to impairments in the cellular homeostasis of evolving regional neuronal subpopulations, and adult-onset cell death from normally non-lethal environmental stressors. Neurodegenerative diseases may, therefore, represent an emerging class of developmental disorders characterized by novel biological responses to subthreshold neurodevelopmental abnormalities that impair targeted neuronal biosynthetic pathways without causing obvious developmental deficits. This developmental model of pathogenesis predicts that it will soon be possible to identify these dysfunctional pathways prior to the occurrence of irreversible cellular injury, and to successfully intervene using innovative neuroprotective and neural regenerative strategies.","The first clear account of synaptic structures in the cerebral cortex was provided by George Gray in 1959. Here we look at the background to this study, which established some clear structural distinctions between synaptic types, and enquire about the extent to which these distinctions can be related to contemporary knowledge of synaptic organization.",,,,"Studies using kainate, an excitatory amino acid extracted from a seaweed, have provided major contributions to the understanding of epileptogenesis. Here we review pioneering and more recent studies aimed at determining how kainate generates seizures and, in particular, how inhibition is altered during seizures. We focus on target and subunit-specific effects of kainate on hippocampal pyramidal neurons and interneurons that lead to an excitation of both types of neurons and thus to the parallel increase of glutamatergic and GABAergic spontaneous currents. We propose that kainate excites all its targets, the net consequence depending on the level of activity of the network.","An analysis of response latencies shows that when an image is presented to the visual system, neuronal activity is rapidly routed to a large number of visual areas. However, the activity of cortical neurons is not determined by this feedforward sweep alone. Horizontal connections within areas, and higher areas providing feedback, result in dynamic changes in tuning. The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.","The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is a neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is cleaved from its precursor protein (APP) by processing at its N and C termini by enzymes known as beta- and gamma-secretases,respectively. The identity of these enzymes has been elusive but the search for the N-terminal secretase might have ended recently with the almost simultaneous publication by five major laboratories claiming a transmembrane aspartic proteinase to be the long sought after beta-secretase. Even at this early stage of its characterization, this aspartic proteinase fulfils many of the key criteria necessary for beta-secretase. The race is now on to develop inhibitors that could prove effective in halting the progression of Alzheimer's disease.","Neural geometry is the major factor that determines connectivity and, possibly, functional output from a nervous system. Recently some of the proteins and pathways involved in specific modes of branch formation or maintenance, or both, have been described. To a variable extent, dendrites and axon collaterals can be viewed as dynamic structures subject to fine modulation that can result either in further growth or retraction. Each form of branching results from specific molecular mechanisms. Cell-internal, substrate-derived factors and functional activity, however, can often differ in their effect according to cell type and physiological context at the site of branch formation. Neural branching is not a linear process but an integrative one that takes place in a microenvironment where we have only a limited experimental access. To attain a coherent mechanism for this phenomenon, quantitative in situ data on the proteins involved and their interactions will be required.","During the course of evolution invertebrates and vertebrates have maintained common signaling molecules, such as neuropeptides. For example, complete hormonal-enzymatic systems for the biosynthesis of opioid peptides have been found in both the CNS and immune systems of these animals. These signaling molecules have been found in the blood circulation and act as immunomodulators. In vertebrates, release of the signaling molecules occurs during stress (cognitive or pathogens), which triggers the hypothalamo-hypophysial-adrenal axis. Similarly, these neuropeptides are used as messengers to initiate and stimulate the innate immune response in invertebrates. Thus, the crosstalk between nervous and immune systems has an ancient evolutionary origin and the messengers used have been conserved during the course of evolution reflecting their vital importance.","Diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive deficits and an increased risk of dementia, particularly in the elderly. These deficits are paralleled by neurophysiological and structural changes in the brain. In animal models of diabetes, impairments of spatial learning occur in association with distinct changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. At the molecular level these impairments might involve changes in glutamate-receptor subtypes, in second-messenger systems and in protein kinases. The multifactorial pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy is not yet completely understood, but clearly shares features with brain ageing and the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. It involves both metabolic and vascular changes, related to chronic hyperglycaemia, but probably also defects in insulin action in the brain. Treatment with insulin might therefore not only correct hyperglycaemia, but could also directly affect the brain.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2001 Jan;24(1):67.,"From a structural perspective, there are ten basic parts of the vertebrate CNS that are almost universally agreed upon. These parts have been grouped in at least five different ways corresponding to five different theories about its basic plan or architecture. Two classical models that remain popular today are derived from (1) comparative anatomy and the body's segmental organization, and (2) comparative embryology and the neural tube's transverse and longitudinal organization. A new approach is concerned with deciphering the genetic program that assembles the nervous system during embryogenesis; how it will correspond to the other models remains to be determined. The simplest current model to explain the organization of the mammalian nervous system involves a segmental trunk that mediates reflex sensory-motor functions, and suprasegmental cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.","The strange and unpleasant sensations (paraesthesiae) or asynchronous motor-unit activation (fasciculation) that result from a period of limb ischaemia are examples of ectopic discharge in peripheral nerves. Ectopic activity also results from demyelination and is associated with serious neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis. A build-up of extracellular K(+) in the internode and persistent Na(+) currents are now implicated in generating the different forms of activity arising in normal and demyelinated axons.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 2000 Apr;23(4):175-80.,"Chronic L-dopa therapy is associated with the development of motor complications in the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although the precise mechanism responsible for these events is not known, increasing laboratory and clinical evidence points to a sequence of events that is initiated by abnormal pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors by the intermittent administration of agents with short half-lives such as L-dopa. Initiating therapy with a long-acting dopamine agonist has been shown to delay the onset and reduce the severity of motor complications in MPTP monkeys and PD patients. Administering L-dopa with a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to block its peripheral metabolism increases its plasma half-life and might have a similar effect. Thus, a rational strategy for treating PD would be to initiate therapy with a long-acting dopamine-receptor agonist and supplement at the appropriate time with L-dopa combined with a COMT inhibitor.","Intermittent or pulsatile dopamine-receptor stimulation is postulated to induce plastic changes in motor systems that are responsible for the development of the motor fluctuations and dyskinesia that complicate long-term L-dopa therapy of Parkinson's disease. As a corollary to this hypothesis, continuous dopamine-receptor stimulation can avoid or reverse these complications. Such continuous stimulation is unlikely to mimic completely the normal function of the dopaminergic system, but should avoid the supra-physiological swings in extracellular dopamine that accompany intermittent L-dopa dosing. The concern is that this continuous stimulation might induce tolerance rather than sensitization to some effects of L-dopa. Open clinical trials support the value of continuous dopaminergic stimulation in Parkinson's disease with established motor complications, but rigorous studies, although experimentally difficult, are needed.","Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor complications show a greater reduction in putamen [18F]dopa uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) compared with sustained responders to L-dopa, although individual ranges overlap considerably. This implies that, although loss of putamen dopamine storage predisposes motor complications in PD, it cannot be the only factor determining timing of onset. Additional PET studies suggest that loss of striatal dopamine storage capacity along with pulsatile exposure to exogenous L-dopa results in pathologically raised synaptic dopamine levels and deranged basal ganglia opioid transmission.This, rather than altered dopamine receptor binding, then causes inappropriate overactivity of basal ganglia-frontal projections, resulting in breakthrough involuntary movements.","The MPTP monkey is a well-characterized animal model of parkinsonism and provides an exceptional tool for the study of dyskinesias induced by dopamine-like agents. Several such agents have been tested during the past 15 years, and it has been found that the duration of action of these compounds is the most reliable variable with which to predict their dyskinesiogenic profile. It is proposed that L-dopa-induced dyskinesias represent a form of pathological learning caused by chronic pulsatile (nonphysiological) stimulation of dopamine receptors, which activates a cascade of molecular and biochemical events. These events include defective regulation of Fos proteins that belong to the deltaFosB family, increased expression of neuropeptides, and defective GABA- and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission in the output structures of the basal ganglia.","Characteristic changes involving interactions between dopamine and glutamate in striatal medium spiny neurons now appear to contribute to symptom production in Parkinson's disease (PD). The balance between kinase and phosphatase signaling modifies the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors and thus their synaptic strength. Sensitization of spiny-neuron NMDA and AMPA receptors alters cortical glutamatergic input to the striatum and modifies striatal GABAergic output, and thus motor function. Conceivably, the pharmacological targeting of spiny-neuron mechanisms modified in PD will provide a safer and more effective therapy.","In the past, functional changes in the circuitry of the basal ganglia that occur in Parkinson's disease were primarily analyzed with electrophysiological and 2-deoxyglucose measurements. The increased activity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) observed has been attributed to a reduction in inhibition mediated by the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), secondary to the loss of dopaminergic-neuron influence on D2-receptor-bearing striato-pallidal neurons. More recently, in situ hybridization studies of cytochrome oxidase subunit I have confirmed the overactivity of the STN in the parkinsonian state. In addition, this technique has provided evidence that the change in STN activity is owing not only to decreased inhibition from the GPe but to hyperactivity of excitatory inputs from the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and the pedunculopontine nucleus in the brainstem.","The basal ganglia are thought to modulate the release or inhibition of movements by way of direct and indirect pathways that act as a push-pull system of cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Here we suggest a three-pathway model of the basal ganglia that takes into consideration the fundamental division of the striatum into striosomes and extrastriosomal matrix. We suggest that, in addition to the balance between direct and indirect pathways on which normal release of individual movements depends, the balance of activity between these matrix-based pathways and the striosomal pathway regulates the frequency of release of given behavioral sequences and, thus, modulates behavioral focus. Differential plasticity in these compartmentally organized circuits might contribute to the development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias under parkinsonian conditions and dopamine-receptor-agonist induced stereotypies under normal conditions.",Gene regulation studies demonstrate that dopamine differentially regulates the direct and indirect projection neurons of the striatum through their respective expression of the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. Induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in striatal neurons is used to study dopamine-receptor-mediated neuronal plasticity. In the dopamine-depleted striatum there is a switch in receptor-mediated signal transduction mechanisms to produce a supersensitive form of D1- mediated neuronal plasticity. This switch is suggested to underlie dopamine-agonist-induced dyskinetic movements that develop during the treatment of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms originate from the loss of the dopaminergic control of neuronal activity in the striatum. Permanent loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum results in an abnormal activity of striatal neurons. The therapeutic treatment with exogenous dopamine, therefore, temporarily restores a balanced synaptic excitation of striatal neurons, counteracting pre- and postsynaptically the excessive glutamate release caused by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers. However, chronic treatment is associated with adverse effects that might reflect nonphysiological dopamine replacement. Basic studies on experimental animal models of PD are of crucial importance for the development of therapeutic agents able to provide relief to individuals with PD, without the adverse effects associated with currently available drugs.","The dopaminergic system exerts dynamic modulation of glutamatergic afferent drive that is dependent on the temporal pattern of the dopaminergic input and the subtypes of striatal neurons affected. The differences in feedforward inhibition between striatal neurons comprising the direct and indirect output pathway confer distinct response-pattern differences in their respective targets,supporting brief bursts of activity in Type-I neurons but attenuating repetitive activity in Type-II cells. This temporal patterning is further modulated by NO-mediated signaling, and by tonic and phasic dopamine-mediated stimulation, which exerts preferential actions on indirect and direct output neurons, respectively. As a result,the striatal network is forced into state-dependent patterns of activity that differentially regulate muscle tone and voluntary motor activity via distinct output projections from the striatum.","Dopamine agonist administration induces changes in firing rate and pattern in basal ganglia nuclei that provide an insight into the role of dopamine in basal ganglia function. These changes support a more complex, integrated basal ganglia network than envisioned in early models. Functionally important effects on basal ganglia output involve alterations in burstiness, synchronization and oscillatory activity,as well as rate. Multisecond oscillations in basal ganglia firing rates are markedly affected by systemic administration of dopamine-receptor agonists. This suggests that coordinated changes in neuronal activity at time scales longer than commonly investigated play a role in the cognitive and motor processes that are modulated by dopamine.","The responses obtained with drugs that act at dopamine receptors depend on the spectrum of receptors stimulated, the pattern of stimulation and the neuronal signal-transduction pathways that are activated. In the absence of drugs that reliably discriminate between the various cloned receptors, elucidating the role of these receptors has largely relied on molecular genetic approaches that include expression of genes for receptors in cell lines and manipulation of this expression in animal models. Connecting molecular events that occur consequent to receptor stimulation with the resulting physiological effects entails bridging a complex network of interactions. This article reviews the current understanding of the molecular, cellular and systemic consequences of activation of the different dopamine receptors.","The dopaminergic nigropallidal and nigrosubthalamic projections control the activity of the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus neurons in both normal and pathological conditions. Intrastriatal dopaminergic neurons increase substantially in animal models of Parkinson's disease. They contain GABA, display the ultrastructural features of interneurons and form axo-axonic synapses with putative cortical-like glutamatergic boutons. The local dendritic release of dopamine by neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental also influences basal ganglia functions. Thus, the long-term belief that the effects of dopamine in the basal ganglia were solely mediated through the nigrostriatal system must be changed to take into account extrastriatal dopaminergic projections and intrastriatal dopaminergic neurons.","Recent neuroanatomical data obtained with single-axon or single-cell labeling procedures in both rodents and primates have revealed the presence of various types of projection neurons with profusely collateralized axons within each of the major components of the basal ganglia. Such findings call for a reappraisal of current concepts of the anatomical and functional organization of the basal ganglia,which play such a crucial role in the control of motor behavior. The basal ganglia now stand as a widely distributed neuronal network, whose elements are endowed with a highly patterned set of axon collaterals. The elucidation of this finely tuned network is needed to understand the complex spatiotemporal sequence of neural events that ensures the flow of cortical information through the basal ganglia.","Insight into the organization of the basal ganglia in the normal, parkinsonian and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia states is critical for the development of newer and more effective therapies for Parkinson's disease. We believe that the basal ganglia can no longer be thought of as a unidirectional linear system that transfers information based solely on a firing-rate code. Rather, we propose that the basal ganglia is a highly organized network, with operational characteristics that simulate a non-linear dynamic system.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with an average onset age of 60 years. In the United States, approximately one million persons suffer from PD, and there are 60,000 newly diagnosed cases every year. The estimated cost of PD to society is $27 billion per year. Based on United States Census Bureau projections, it is estimated that the frequency of PD will increase fourfold by the year 2040, making it an even larger burden on patients, their families and society.","Visual cortical cells are commonly characterized by their receptive-field structure. Originally, a visual receptive field was defined in a purely spatial way as that retinal area from which a change in spiking response of the regarded cell could be elicited by visual stimulation. The first attempts to understand receptive-field structure were based entirely on the anatomical connectivity of the primary visual pathway. More recently, however, it has been discovered that the spatial and temporal context in which a stimulus is presented to a cell can strongly influence its receptive field, and this in turn is dependent on the state of arousal and attention. Accordingly, new concepts recognize that cortical receptive fields are highly dynamic entities embracing more than the sum of the full spatial and temporal response properties of a cell.","In spite of the rapid advances in our understanding of vanilloid-receptor pharmacology in the PNS, the function of vanilloid receptors in the brain has remained elusive. Recently, the endocannabinoid anandamide has been proposed to function as an endogenous agonist at the vanilloid receptor VR1. This is an exciting hypothesis because the localization of VR1 overlaps with that of anandamide and its preferred cannabinoid receptor CB(1) in various brain areas. The interaction of anandamide and/or related lipid metabolites with these two completely separate receptor systems in the brain clearly places VR1 in a much broader role than pain perception. At a practical level, the overlapping ligand recognition properties of VR1 and CB(1) might be exploited by medicinal chemistry. For example, arvanil, a 'chimeric' ligand that combines structural features of capsaicin and anandamide, promises to be an interesting lead for new drugs that interact at both vanilloid and cannabinoid receptors.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jan;24(1):8.,"Though many neuroscientific methods have been brought to bear in the search for functional specializations within prefrontal cortex, little consensus has emerged. To assess the contribution of functional neuroimaging, this article reviews patterns of frontal-lobe activation associated with a broad range of different cognitive demands, including aspects of perception, response selection, executive control, working memory, episodic memory and problem solving. The results show a striking regularity: for many demands, there is a similar recruitment of mid-dorsolateral, mid-ventrolateral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Much of the remainder of frontal cortex, including most of the medial and orbital surfaces, is largely insensitive to these demands. Undoubtedly, these results provide strong evidence for regional specialization of function within prefrontal cortex. This specialization, however, takes an unexpected form: a specific frontal-lobe network that is consistently recruited for solution of diverse cognitive problems.","Two classes of receptors transduce neurotransmitter signals: ionotropic receptors and heptahelical metabotropic receptors. Whereas the ionotropic receptors are structurally associated with a membrane channel, a mediating mechanism is necessary to functionally link metabotropic receptors with their respective effectors. According to the accepted paradigm, the first step in the metabotropic transduction process requires the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. An increasing number of observations, however, point to a novel mechanism through which neurotransmitters can initiate biochemical signals and modulate neuronal excitability. According to this mechanism metabotropic receptors induce responses by activating transduction systems that do not involve G-proteins.","The serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphé nucleus innervate much of the forebrain and are thought to be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Dysfunction of these cells might be involved in the neural mechanisms underlying depression and suicide. The traffic in pathways emanating from the dorsal raphé nucleus is controlled by 5-HT(1) autoreceptors. Until recently it was thought that the autoreceptors in the dorsal raphé nucleus were solely of the 5-HT(1A) subtype. In this article, we discuss evidence that the situation is more complex and that multiple 5-HT(1) subtypes govern different aspects of 5-HT function in the dorsal raphé nucleus presenting new therapeutic opportunities.","The important effect of cell death on projecting neurons during development is well established. However, this mainstream research might have diverted recognition of the cell death that occurs at earlier stages of neural development, affecting proliferating neural precursor cells and young neuroblasts. In this article, we briefly present observations supporting the occurrence of programmed cell death during early neural development in a regulated fashion that to some extent parallels the death of projecting neurons lacking neurotrophic support. These findings raise new questions, in particular the magnitude and the role of this early neural cell death.","This is a great age to participate in biological inquiry. Behavioral neuroscience offers a rich perspective for molecular biologists. However, behavioral analysis is not simply an assay. Whereas molecular biology has become a unique tool in the armamentarium of behavioral neuroscience, the powerful methodology of molecular biology is no substitute for careful behavioral exploration.",,,,,,"It is now well accepted that endogenous morphine is present in animals, both in invertebrates and vertebrates. It is a key signaling molecule that plays an important role in downregulating physiological responses, such as those in the immune system, including immune elements in the CNS. It has been demonstrated that a specific mu-opiate-receptor subtype, mu3, mediates these downregulatory effects through release of NO. This article examines morphine as an endogenous signaling molecule, in terms of its role in neural and immune regulation.","Recent studies indicate an important role of cytoskeleton-associated and lipid-anchored proteins in the formation of inhibitory postsynaptic membrane specializations. Membrane apposition of the tubulin-binding protein gephyrin is essential for the recruitment of inhibitory glycine receptors and GABAA receptors to developing postsynaptic sites. Newly disclosed interactions between gephyrin, exchange factors for G proteins of the Rho and Rac families, the translational regulator RAFT1, and actin-binding proteins like profilin might integrate activity-dependent and trophic-factor-mediated signals at developing postsynaptic sites. A model of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor clustering, is proposed, in which this process is initiated by receptor-driven activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.","The secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, which function as an inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store, contain both the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor/Ca2+ channel and the high-capacity low-affinity Ca2+ storage proteins, chromogranins A and B. Chromogranins A and B, which exist in approximately 2 mm range in the secretory granules, can bind 50-100 mol of Ca2+/mol with dissociation constants of 2-4 mm. These proteins interact directly with the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor/ Ca2+ channel at the intragranular pH 5.5, not only changing the conformation of the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor/Ca2+ channel but also modulating the channel activity. Given the homo- and heterotetrameric existence of both the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor/Ca2+ channel and chromogranins A and B, these tetrameric proteins appear to interact, thus controlling the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.","In many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, symptoms are present that appear to reflect an essential absence of normal movement, cognition and emotional states. These negative symptoms might reflect fundamental impairments in basic brain mechanisms that underlie goal-directed behaviour. Knowledge of the pathology and pathophysiology of these diseases, combined with evidence from basic science, offers opportunities for understanding the neurobiological basis of goal-directed behaviour, particularly the interaction between limbic structures and striato-thalamo-cortical circuits. The study of patients with negative symptoms also provides opportunities for testing cognitive models of goal-directed behaviour, and eventually to map such models onto the neurobiology of both normal and abnormal behaviour.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jan;24(1):8-9.,"In 1998, the discovery of two novel genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, mutated in a rare inherited form of epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions, for the first time enabled insight into the molecular etiology of a human idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome. These disease genes encode subunits of neuronal M-type K+ channels, key regulators of brain excitability. Analogies between benign familial neonatal convulsions and other channelopathies of skeletal and cardiac muscle, including periodic paralysis, myotonia and the long QT syndrome, provide clues about the nature of epilepsy-susceptibility genes and about the fundamental basis of epilepsy as an episodic disorder. It now appears that the KCNQ2/KCNQ3 K+ channels that are mutated in benign familial neonatal convulsions represent an important new target for anti-epileptic drugs. In the future, the identification of ion channel defects as predisposing factors in the common epilepsies could herald a new era of genotype-specific therapies.","Although the gene responsible for Huntington's disease was discovered in 1993, the pathogenic mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin causes neuronal dysfunction and death remain unclear. However, increasing evidence suggests that mutant huntingtin disrupts the normal transcriptional program of susceptible neurons. Thus, transcriptional dysregulation might be an important pathogenic mechanism in Huntington's disease.",,,,"Many human pathological conditions with genetic defects in DNA damage responses are also characterized by neurological deficits. These neurological deficits can manifest themselves during many stages of development, suggesting an important role for DNA repair or processing during the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Although the molecular neuropathology associated with such deficits is largely unknown, many of the responsible gene defects have been identified. The current rapid progress in elucidation of molecular details following gene identification should provide further insight into the importance of DNA processing in nervous system function.",,,"Homologizing behaviour was once considered unreliable, but the application of modern comparative methods has been shown to provide strong evidence of behavioural homologies. Skilled forelimb movements were thought to originate in the primate lineage but in fact are common among tetrapod taxa and probably share a common origin in early tetrapods. Furthermore, skilled movements are likely to have been derived from, and elaborated through, food-handling behaviour. In addition, it is now thought that the role played by the lateral and medial descending pathways of the spinal cord in the execution of skilled forelimb movements could be synergistic, rather than the exclusive responsibility of an individual pathway.","Neurological diseases, including global ischemia, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are characterized by selective patterns of neurodegeneration. Most studies of potential glutamate-receptor-mediated contributions to disease have focused on the highly Ca2+-permeable and widely distributed NMDA-receptor channel. However, an alternative hypothesis is that the presence of AMPA- or kainate-receptor channels that are directly permeable to Ca2+ ions (Ca-A/K-receptor channels) is of greater significance to the neuronal loss seen in these conditions. Besides a restricted distribution and high Ca2+ permeability, two other factors make Ca-A/K receptors appealing candidate contributors to selective injury: their high permeability to Zn2+ ions and the possibility that their numbers increase in disease-associated conditions. Further characterization of the functions of these channels should result in new approaches to treatment of these conditions.","The molecules originally described as the hypocretins and subsequently as the orexins were initially implicated in the control of food intake. Recent observations implicate this newly-described neurotransmitter system in the sleep disorder narcolepsy and, potentially, in the regulation of normal sleep processes. This article reviews the research that led to the isolation of the hypocretin/orexin peptides, their receptors and the activity of these molecules as we currently understand them. A model is proposed in which the cells that make these peptides might be involved in arousal state control.","Neurons that constitute the cerebral cortex must migrate hundreds of cell-body distances from their place of birth, and through several anatomical boundaries, to reach their final position within the correct cortical layer. Human neurological conditions associated with abnormal neuronal migration, together with spontaneous and engineered mouse mutants, define at least four distinct steps in cortical neuronal migration. Many of the genes that control neuronal migration have strong genetic or biochemical links to the cytoskeleton, suggesting that the field of neuronal migration might be closing in on the underlying cytoskeletal events.","Mammalian homeogenes of the Emx family, Emx1 and Emx2, are expressed in the developing cerebral cortex and are involved in the patterning of the rostral brain. Although very little is known about the role of Emx1, details of the function of EMX2 are emerging from the observation of cortical phenotypes in normal and mutant mice. Emx2 is expressed in proliferating neuroblasts and in the so-called postmitotic Cajal-Retzius cells, known to control migration of cortical neurons. The graded distribution of EMX2 homeoprotein suggests a potential role for Emx2 in the subdivision of the cortex into territories and possibly areas.","Neural transplantation holds promise for focal CNS repair. Owing to the shortage of human donor material, which is derived from aborted embryos, and ethical concerns over its use, animal donor tissue is now considered an appropriate alternative. In the USA, individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, focal epilepsy or stroke have already received neural grafts from pig embryos. However, in animal models, neural tissue transplanted between species is usually promptly rejected, even when implanted in the brain. Some of the immunological mechanisms that underlie neural xenograft rejection have recently been elucidated, but others remain to be determined and controlled before individuals with neurological disorders can benefit from xenotransplantation.","Social rather than scientific barriers are impeding neuroscience theory. There are plenty of experimental data and mathematical methods to develop a rigorous, mathematical theory in neuroscience. However, structural mathematical efforts are being suffocated by the requirement to produce numbers immediately. Also theoretical development is tied too closely to one experimental group. The social barriers can be addressed by: (1) judging theory by structural accuracy rather than numerical output; (2) recognizing mathematical theory (not just computational modeling) as a method for producing insight into neurobiological phenomena; (3) funding fundamental theoretical neuroscience and (4) recognizing theoretical neuroscientists as neuroscientists.",,,,,,"Autoreactive B cells and antibodies can be detected in a variety of neurological diseases. Their causative role has been established in some disorders and they are obviously involved in the pathogenesis of others. Some mechanisms engendering B-cell autoimmunity in animal models have been shown to operate in humans. Factors that determine B-cell immune-response patterns and the effector pathways have been identified. B-cell responses to CNS-restricted autoantigens are governed by distinctive immune reactions. Evidence has accumulated that the CNS is a permissive and, under inflammatory conditions, even a B-cell-supporting micro-environment. Data from human and animal experiments have enhanced our understanding of B-cell physiology in health and neurological disease, which has relevant diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","Neurogenic placodes are specialized regions of the embryonic ectoderm that are central to the development of the cranial sensory systems of vertebrates. These structures generate many of the sensory neurones of the head and also, in some instances, the associated sensory receptor cells. The neurogenic placodes have often been thought to share common pathways of development and to have evolved together. However, recent work has shown that this is not the case. The term 'neurogenic placodes' no longer seems to describe a cohesive group. Rather, the neurogenic placodes fall into a number of categories, and it is within each of these that the members share a common development and evolution.","Release probability (P) appears to be a major factor that influences the pattern of transmitter release. At cortical pyramidal axon inputs onto different classes of target cells, very different release patterns are observed, patterns that correlate with release probability. Simplistically, 'low P' synapses display facilitation and augmentation, whereas 'high P' synapses supplied by the same axon exhibit paired-pulse and frequency-dependent depression. Different combinations of factors probably contribute to release probability at different terminals, during development and under different experimental conditions. The recent advances made by molecular biological studies of the release machinery do, however, provide candidate proteins and protein-protein interactions whose differential distributions might be important factors in determining the patterns of transmitter release.","Mitochondria have been linked to both necrotic and apoptotic cell death, which are thought to have a major role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence shows that nuclear gene defects affecting mitochondrial function have a role in the pathogenesis of Friedreich's ataxia, Wilson's disease and hereditary spastic paraplegia. There is also accumulating evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction might have a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. If this is so, a number of therapeutic targets are implicated that might result in novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.","Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an important mechanism that determines the size and shape of the vertebrate nervous system. Recent gene-targeting studies have indicated that homologs of the cell-death pathway in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have analogous functions in apoptosis in the developing mammalian brain. However, epistatic genetic analysis has revealed that the apoptosis of progenitor cells during early embryonic development and apoptosis of postmitotic neurons at later stage of brain development have distinct roles and mechanisms. These results provide new insight on the significance and mechanism of neural cell death in mammalian brain development.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2000 Aug;23(8):344.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Dec;23(12):611-2. Trends Neurosci. 2000 Oct;23(10):467-8.,,,"The arbitrary linkage of sensory cues to actions and goals represents one of the most-flexible capabilities in the behavioral repertoire of mammals. This ability has been termed 'conditional motor learning', 'conditional discrimination' or, more recently, 'arbitrary visuomotor mapping'. Unlike other forms of visuomotor guidance, in arbitrary mapping the location of the sensory cue lacks any systematic spatial relationship with the action or its goal. Recent work has identified much of the neural network that underlies this behavior. It consists of parts of the frontal cortex, hippocampal system and basal ganglia, each of which has neurons whose activity undergoes systematic evolution during learning.","Several studies support the hypothesis that after stroke, specific features of brain function revert to those seen at an early stage of development, with the subsequent process of recovery recapitulating ontogeny in many ways. Many clinical characteristics of stroke recovery resemble normal development, particularly in the motor system. Consistent with this, brain-mapping studies after an ischemic insult suggest re-emergence of childhood organizational patterns: recovery being associated with a return to adult patterns. Experimental animal studies demonstrate increased levels of developmental proteins, particularly in the area surrounding an infarct, suggesting an active process of reconditioning in response to cerebral ischemia. Understanding the patterns of similarity between normal development and stroke recovery might be of value in its treatment.","Astrocytes constitute the most abundant cell type in the nervous system. Under physiological conditions, they respond to the stimuli to which neurons are also responsive. The use of astrocytoma cell lines with well-defined morphological and functional markers has been helpful for addressing the mechanisms of signal transduction that operate in the nervous system. On the basis of the effects produced by agonists of different types of receptor (muscarinic ACh receptors, thrombin receptors, phospholipases A2 receptors and tumor necrosis factor alpha receptors), several different transcriptional programs that involve the MAP kinase-cytosolic phospholipase A2 system and the transcription factor NF-kappaB have been described.","Seasonal plasticity of structure and function is a fundamental feature of nervous systems in a wide variety of animals that occupy seasonal environments. Excellent examples of seasonal brain changes are found in the avian song control system, which has become a leading model of morphological and functional plasticity in the adult CNS. The volumes of entire brain regions that control song increase dramatically in anticipation of the breeding season. These volumetric changes are induced primarily by vernal increases in circulating sex steroids and are accompanied by increases in neuronal size, number and spacing. In several species, these structural changes in the song control circuitry are associated with seasonal changes in song production and learning. Songbirds provide important insights into the mechanisms and behavioral consequences of plasticity in the adult brain.","Psychophysical studies of the short-term memory for attributes or dimensions of the visual stimulus that are known to be important in early visual processing (spatial frequency, orientation, contrast, motion and color) identify a low-level perceptual memory mechanism. This proposed mechanism is located early in the visual processing stream, prior to the structural description system responsible for shape priming but beyond primary visual cortex (V1); it is composed of a series of parallel, special-purpose perceptual mechanisms with independent but limited processing resources. Each mechanism is devoted to the analysis of a single dimension and is coupled to a memory store.","Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, the cause of which is unknown. Excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are all likely to contribute to the striatal cell death that occurs in this disorder. There are accumulating data indicating that under specific circumstances, dopamine, which occurs in high concentrations in the basal ganglia, might be neurotoxic. In this article, the current models used to study Huntington's disease are reviewed and the recent findings that implicate dopamine in the pathophysiology of this progressive disorder are discussed. Although many questions remain unanswered, the dopaminergic system could contribute to striatal vulnerability in Huntington's disease and provide a novel avenue for the development of new therapies.","Gene targeting has proved to be one of the most powerful techniques with which one can investigate molecular mechanisms that underlie complex phenomena such as learning and memory. Despite its popularity, however, concerns have been raised about this technique and alternative approaches have been sought. One such approach is protein targeting, which is based on the application of immunoadhesins, genetically engineered fusion proteins that exhibit functionally relevant target specificity. These immunoadhesins modulate the activity of not only a single receptor but of all receptors with homologous binding sites, which thereby eliminates the possibility of compensation by sister receptors. Furthermore, immunoadhesins can be used not only to impair but also to improve receptor function in the brain. Initial studies using immunoadhesins suggest that protein targeting might be a useful approach for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of brain function and behavior.",,,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifaceted organelle that regulates protein synthesis and trafficking, cellular responses to stress, and intracellular Ca2+ levels. In neurons, it is distributed between the cellular compartments that regulate plasticity and survival, which include axons, dendrites, growth cones and synaptic terminals. Intriguing communication networks between ER, mitochondria and plasma membrane are being revealed that provide mechanisms for the precise regulation of temporal and spatial aspects of Ca2+ signaling. Alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis in ER contribute to neuronal apoptosis and excitotoxicity, and are being linked to the pathogenesis of several different neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and stroke.",The realization that different behavioural and perceptual states of the brain are associated with different brain rhythms has sparked growing interest in the oscillatory behaviours of neurons. Recent research has uncovered a close association between electrical oscillations and resonance in neurons. Resonance is an easily measurable property that describes the ability of neurons to respond selectively to inputs at preferred frequencies. A variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and oscillation in neurons. Understanding the basic principles involved in the production of resonance allows for a simplified classification of these mechanisms. The characterization of resonance and frequency preference captures those essential properties of neurons that can serve as a substrate for coordinating network activity around a particular frequency in the brain.,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) occurs physiologically as the ascorbate anion: a water-soluble antioxidant that is found throughout the body. However, despite the high, homeostatically regulated levels of brain ascorbate, its specific functions in the CNS are only beginning to be elucidated. Certainly, it acts as part of the intracellular antioxidant network, and as such is normally neuroprotective. There is also evidence that it acts as a neuromodulator. A possibly unique role it might have is as an antioxidant in the brain extracellular microenvironment, where its concentration is modulated by glutamate-ascorbate heteroexchange at glutamate uptake sites. Ongoing studies of ascorbate and glutamate transporters should lead to rapid progress in understanding ascorbate regulation and function.","The monosynaptic stretch reflex is a fundamental feature of sensory-motor organization in most animal groups. In isolation, it serves largely as a negative feedback devoted to postural controls; however, when it is involved in diverse movements, it can be modified by central command circuits. In order to understand the implications of such modifications, a model system has been chosen that has been studied at many different levels: the crayfish walking system. Recent studies have revealed several levels of control and modulation (for example, at the levels of the sensory afferent and the output synapse from the sensory afferent, and via changes in the membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron) that operate complex and highly adaptive sensory-motor processing. During a given motor task, such mechanisms reshape the sensory message completely, such that the stretch reflex becomes a part of the central motor command.","The subunit switching of ligand-gated receptors is a potentially important mechanism through which synaptic plasticity can be achieved in the nervous system. Although established in an activity-dependent manner for neurotransmission that is mediated by excitatory amino acids, there is much less direct evidence for a role of subunit switching in long-term plasticity of GABAA receptors in the adult. We argue that the hypothalamic oxytocin neurones, which exhibit marked plasticity through each reproductive cycle, provide an excellent model of both presynaptic and postsynaptic long-term plasticity of GABA-mediated transmission in the mature nervous system. The postsynaptic plasticity involves GABAA-receptor-subunit switching in an activity-independent manner. It also has profound effects on the electrical behaviour of the oxytocin neurones and, thus, the neural control of pregnancy and lactation.","The use of viral vectors to transfect genes into specific brain-cell populations is a novel approach that can be used to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of brain function. Ideal vectors should be targetable and capable of regulated transgene expression. From the viral vectors developed so far, this article focuses on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based vectors. HSV-1 vectors can be engineered for gene transfer to the brain, which makes them suitable for neuroscience research applications. In particular, genetic manipulations of the virus can almost eliminate toxicity and allow expression of multiple transgenes simultaneously. In some instances, transfection of selected neuronal populations is also possible. Specific alterations in behaviour and in disease models have been described after the viral-vector-mediated expression of specific genes within highly localized brain regions.",,,"In the past few years it has become apparent that mitochondria have an essential role in the life and death of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The central mitochondrial bioenergetic parameter is the protonmotive force, Deltap. Much research has focused on the monitoring of the major component of Deltap, the mitochondrial membrane potential Deltapsim, in intact neurones exposed to excitotoxic stimuli, in the hope of establishing the causal relationships between cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several fluorescent techniques have been used, and this article discusses their merits and pitfalls.","A steadily increasing number of cDNAs for proteins that are structurally related to the TRP ion channels have been cloned in recent years. All these proteins display a topology of six transmembrane segments that is shared with some voltage-gated channels and the cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels. The TRP channels can be divided, on the basis of their homology, into three TRP channel (TRPC) subfamilies: short (S), long (L) and osm (O). From the evidence available to date, this subdivision can also be made according to channel function. Thus, the STRPC family, which includes Drosophila TRP and TRPL and the mammalian homologues, TRPC1-7, is a family of Ca2+-permeable cation channels that are activated subsequent to receptor-mediated stimulation of different isoforms of phospholipase C. Members of the OTRPC family are Ca2+-permeable channels involved in pain transduction (vanilloid and vanilloid-like receptors), epithelial Ca2+ transport and, at least in Caenorhabditis elegans, in chemo-, mechano- and osmoregulation. The LTRPC family is less well characterized.","Diverse vertebrate animals can sense the earth's magnetic field, but little is known about the physiological mechanisms that underlie this sensory ability. Three major hypotheses of magnetic-field detection have been proposed. Electrosensitive marine fish might sense the geomagnetic field through electromagnetic induction, although definitive evidence that such fish actually do so has not yet been obtained. Studies with other vertebrates have provided evidence consistent with two different mechanisms: biogenic magnetite and chemical reactions that are modulated by magnetic fields. Despite recent progress, however, primary magnetoreceptors have not yet been identified unambiguously in any animal.","Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery at the end of 1799 and communicated his invention to the Royal Society of London in 1800. The studies that led him to develop this revolutionary device began in 1792, after Volta read the work of Luigi Galvani on the existence of an intrinsic electricity in living organisms. During these studies, Volta obtained a series of results of great physiological relevance, which led him to anticipate some important ideas that marked the inception of modern neuroscience. These results have been obscured by a cultural tradition that has seen Volta exclusively as a physicist, lacking interest for biological problems and opposed in an irreversible way to the physiologist, Luigi Galvani.","Since early anatomical descriptions, the existence of dendritic spines has stimulated intense curiosity and speculation about their regulation and function. Research over the past three decades has described an impressive mutability in dendritic-spine number and morphology under a variety of physiological circumstances. Current evidence favors a proposed model in which two pools of actin filaments, one stable and the other dynamic, support both persistent spine structure and rapid spine motility. Potential functions of spine motility and dynamic actin include regulated protein scaffolding, retrograde signaling and synapse stabilization.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Oct;23(10):466-7.,,"The probabilistic gating of voltage-dependent ion channels is a source of electrical 'channel noise' in neurons. This noise has long been implicated in limiting the reliability (repeatability) of neuronal responses to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. More recently, it has been shown to increase the range of spiking behaviors exhibited in some neural populations. Channel numbers are tied to metabolic efficiency and the stability of resting potential, and channel noise might be exploited by future cochlear implants in order to improve the temporal representation of sound.","The principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the excitatory pyramidal cells, which project to distant targets, and the inhibitory nonpyramidal cells, which are the cortical interneurones. This article reviews evidence suggesting that these two neuronal types are generated in distinct proliferative zones. Pyramidal cells are derived from the neuroepithelium in the cortical ventricular zone, and use the processes of radial glia in order to migrate and take their positions in the cortex in an 'inside-out' sequence. Relatively few nonpyramidal cells are generated in the cortical neuroepithelium: the majority is derived from the ganglionic eminence of the ventral telencephalon. These nonpyramidal neurones use tangential migratory paths to reach the cortex, probably travelling along axonal bundles of the developing corticofugal fibre system.","Striatal spiny neurones serve as a major anatomical locus for the relay of cortical information flow through the basal ganglia. these projection neurones also represent the main synaptic target of cholinergic interneurones, whose physiological role in striatal activity still remains largely enigmatic. The striatal cholinergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, but the cellular mechanisms underlying cholinergic-neurone function are still unknown. On the basis of in vitro electrophysiological evidence, obtained from a rat corticostriatal-slice preparation, we propose that endogenous ACh exerts a complex modulation of striatal synaptic transmission, which produces both short-term and long-term effects. ACh-mediated mechanisms might be of crucial importance in processing the cortical inputs to the striatum.","Recent technological development has opened fascinating opportunities in research on cognitive functions of the human brain. For example, cortical representations of sensory functions and their reorganization, which have been studied thoroughly in animals, are far better understood in humans now than they were only a decade ago. Hemodynamic and electromagnetic studies have demonstrated that a modality-specific brain area that is totally deprived of its normal sensory input becomes responsive to stimulation of other modalities. The functional significance of this cross-modal activation was recently indicated by, for example, studies showing that the occipital cortex of the blind is activated by sound changes, when the task is to detect these changes. Moreover, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation applied to the occipital cortex of blind individuals results in distortions and omissions of letters in Braille text being read by the subject. Contrary to prevailing views, cross-modal neural reorganization might, as shown by recent results, take place even in the mature human brain.","Short-term synaptic plasticity has a key role in information processing in the CNS, whereas memories can be formed through long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Despite the importance of these phenomena, it remains difficult to determine whether a synaptic modulation is expressed at a presynaptic or postsynaptic site. This article describes a new approach that, in its simplest form, can identify the site of expression by direct graphical means. A more-sophisticated form of the technique can quantify functional synaptic properties and determine which of these properties is altered following a modulation of synaptic strength.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Sep;23(9):407-9.,"Several forms of inherited muscular dystrophy are associated with brain abnormalities and cognitive impairment. One of the most common and severe of these diseases is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Dystrophin, the product of the DMD gene, is found in neurones, where it is associated with the postsynaptic membrane. Cognitive impairment in individuals with DMD is thought to be due to an abnormality in the neuronal membrane that is caused by lack of dystrophin. Recent experimental evidence has provided valuable clues in our understanding of the complex molecular neurobiology of muscular dystrophy.",,,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration via Ins(1,4,5)P3- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores in neurons. Both types of store are coupled functionally to Ca2+-permeable channels found in the plasma membrane. The mGluR-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration can activate Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels and Ca2+-dependent nonselective cationic channels. These mGluR-mediated effects often result from mobilization of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive, rather than Ins(1,4, 5)P3-sensitive, Ca2+ stores, suggesting that close functional interactions exist between mGluRs, intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+-sensitive ion channels in the membrane.","Prolonged changes in synaptic strength, such as those that occur in LTP and LTD, are thought to contribute to learning and memory processes. These complex phenomena occur in diverse brain structures and use multiple, temporally staged and spatially resolved mechanisms, such as changes in neurotransmitter release, modulation of transmitter receptors, alterations in synaptic structure, and regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the combined activation of SRC family tyrosine kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C and, in particular, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II results in phosphorylation of glutamate-receptor-gated ion channels and the enhancement of subsequent postsynaptic current. Crosstalk between these complex biochemical pathways can account for most characteristics of early-phase LTP in this region.","The old concept that the direct intercellular cytoplasmic connections between neurones participate in the coordination of neuronal activity has gained new relevance, owing to recent theoretical and experimental evidence, particularly with regard to neuronal synchronization and epileptogenesis. Computer simulations demonstrating that neurones synchronize and alter their firing patterns depending on gap-junctional communication, have provided insights into the interactions between electrotonic coupling and cellular and synaptic characteristics. Experimental manipulations of gap-junctional communication support its role in the generation and maintenance of synchronized neuronal firing and seizures. Hence, in addition to chemical transmission, direct electrotonic coupling might contribute to normal and abnormal physiological brain rhythms.","It has been suggested that depolarization per se can control neurotransmitter release, in addition to its role in promoting Ca2+ influx. The 'Ca2+ hypothesis' has provided an essential framework for understanding how Ca2+ entry and accumulation in nerve terminals controls transmitter release. Yet, increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels alone cannot account for the initiation and termination of release; some additional mechanism is needed. Several experiments from various laboratories indicate that membrane potential has a decisive role in controlling this release. For example, depolarization causes release when Ca2+ entry is blocked and intracellular Ca2+ levels are held at an elevated level. The key molecules that link membrane potential with release control have not yet been identified: likely candidates are presynaptic autoreceptors and perhaps the Ca2+ channel itself.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 May;23(5):198.,"A range of molecules control nerve-cell survival in the brain. Many of these molecules might be neuroprotective through activation of the transcription factor cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB). Activation of CREB, by phosphorylation of Ser133, occurs in brain-damage-resistant hippocampal dentate granule cells and is triggered by neuroprotective environmental stimulation. In addition, the Akt neuroprotective signaling pathway activates CREB, and CREB synthesis and phosphorylation promote the survival of many cells, including neurons, in vitro. Thus, CREB might be responsible for programmed nerve-cell survival. Studies investigating its role in the brain are now required to confirm these in vitro results, and the downstream survival genes, whose expression is activated by CREB in neurons, need to be identified.",,,,"The pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus are proportionately larger in higher mammals, particularly in primates, and account for a quarter of the total mass. Traditionally, these nuclei have been divided into oral (somatosensory), superior and inferior (both visual) and medial (visual, multi-sensory) divisions. With reciprocal connections to vast areas of cerebral cortex, and input from the colliculus and retina, they occupy an analogous position in the extra-striate visual system to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the primary visual pathway, but deal with higher-order visual and visuomotor transduction. With a renewed recent interest in this thalamic nuclear collection, and growth in our knowledge of the cortex with which it communicates, perhaps the time is right to look to new dimensions in the pulvinar code.","It has been known since the middle of the 19th century that different neuronal types are distributed across the retinal surface in non-random arrays: indeed, these arrays, called 'mosaics', have long been considered to be a fundamental feature of retinal organization. However, until recently, little was known about how such mosaics are established during development. In the hope of stimulating further research, this article reviews the current status of three very different approaches to this intriguing general problem. The first postulates arrays of molecular markers, which are produced by specific cell types shortly after their final mitotic divisions and could be influential in the differentiation of other cell types. The second invokes a tangential dispersion of differentiating cells to generate spatial order, either while these cells are still migrating or soon after they reach their laminar destinations. The third involves the elimination of wrongly positioned cells through the process of naturally occurring cell death.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2000 Feb;23(2):59.,"Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands constitute a novel modulatory system that is involved in specific brain functions, such as nociception, control of movement, memory and neuroendocrine regulation. Recently, it has also been suggested that this system is involved in brain development. Studies have used a variety of techniques to elucidate the effects of cannabinoids during development, as well as to characterize the presence of elements of the endogenous cannabinoid system (receptors and ligands) in the developing brain. Collectively, they suggest that endocannabinoids participate in brain development through the activation of second-messenger-coupled cannabinoid receptors.","Recent data on the expression of several homeobox genes in the embryonic telencephalon of mammals, birds and reptiles support the homology of a part of the avian pallium, named the Wulst, and at least the more-medial and superior parts of mammalian neocortex. This conclusion is also supported by previous embryological, topological and hodological data. Furthermore, new evidence on the connections and electrophysiological properties of specific subfields within the avian Wulst, and on the thalamic territories that project to these fields, supports the more-specific conclusion that a primary visual area and a primary somatosensory-somatomotor area are present in the avian Wulst; these areas are likely to be homologous to their counterparts in mammals. In spite of this, developmental, morphological and comparative evidence indicate that some structural and physiological traits that appear to be similar in the Wulst and neocortex (such as the lamination or binocularity) evolved independently in birds and mammals.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Aug;23(8):345-6.,"Nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) have been implicated in a variety of brain functions, including neuronal development, learning and memory formation, and reward. Although there are substantial data indicating that nAChR subunits are found in many brain regions, the precise cellular roles of these subunits in neuronal functions have remained elusive. Until recently, nAChRs were thought primarily to serve a modulatory role in the brain by regulating neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals. However, new evidence has revealed that nAChRs also function in a postsynaptic role by mediating fast ACh-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and in the sensory cortex, and are found at somatodendritic as well as nerve terminal sites in the reward system. It is possible that presynaptic and postsynaptic nAChRs mediate changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission in these brain regions. These changes could underlie the proposed functions of nAChRs in cognitive functions of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, in neuronal development in the sensory cortex, and in reward.","'Housekeepers' of living organisms maintain salt and water balance, monitor blood sugar and schedule their work to the season and the time of day. In order to perform their chores, they rely on information about the status quo. The traditional concept of a sensor that communicates with a central comparator authorizing an effector, which was inspired by engineers, has become blurred in the search for morphological correlates of such regulatory cascades. In many cases, neurones, which are both sensory and neurosecretory, and endocrine cells equipped with smart detectors, reliably regulate autonomous functions by using local rather than central computing. Like the well-trained staff of a smoothly run household, such 'sensing effectors' translate information into action.","The two components of voluntary tracking eye-movements in primates, pursuit and saccades, are generally viewed as relatively independent oculomotor subsystems that move the eyes in different ways using independent visual information. Although saccades have long been known to be guided by visual processes related to perception and cognition, only recently have psychophysical and physiological studies provided compelling evidence that pursuit is also guided by such higher-order visual processes, rather than by the raw retinal stimulus. Pursuit and saccades also do not appear to be entirely independent anatomical systems, but involve overlapping neural mechanisms that might be important for coordinating these two types of eye movement during the tracking of a selected visual object. Given that the recovery of objects from real-world images is inherently ambiguous, guiding both pursuit and saccades with perception could represent an explicit strategy for ensuring that these two motor actions are driven by a single visual interpretation.",,,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Jun;23(6):245-6.,"The mechanisms underlying the formation of topographic maps in the retinotectal system have long been debated. Recently, members of the Eph and ephrin receptor-ligand family have been found to provide a molecular substrate for one type of mechanism, that of chemospecific gradient matching, as proposed by Sperry. However, experiments over several decades have demonstrated that there is more to map formation than gradient matching. This article briefly reviews the old and new findings, argues that these two types of data must be properly integrated in order to understand map formation fully, and suggests some experimental and theoretical ways to begin this process.","Mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons are thought to serve as a final common neural pathway for mediating reinforcement processes. However, several recent findings have challenged the view that mesolimbic dopamine has a crucial role in the maintenance of reinforcement processes, or the subjective rewarding actions of natural rewards and drugs of abuse. Instead, there is growing evidence that dopamine is involved in the formation of associations between salient contextual stimuli and internal rewarding or aversive events. This evidence suggests that dopaminergic-neuron activation aids the organism in learning to recognize stimuli associated with such events. Thus, mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons have an important function in the acquisition of behavior reinforced by natural reward and drug stimuli. Furthermore, long-lasting neuroadaptive changes in mesolimbic dopamine-mediated transmission that develop during chronic drug use might contribute to compulsive drug-seeking behavior and relapse.","Recently, the study of sensory cortex has focused on the context-dependent evolution of receptive fields and cortical maps over millisecond to second time-scales. This article reviews advances in our understanding of these processes in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Subthreshold input to individual rat SI neurons is extensive, spanning several vibrissae from the center of the receptive field, and arrives within 25 ms of vibrissa deflection. These large subthreshold receptive fields provide a broad substrate for rapid excitatory and inhibitory multi-vibrissa interactions. The 'whisking' behavior, an approximately 8 Hz ellipsoid movement of the vibrissae, introduces a context-dependent change in the pattern of vibrissa movement during tactile exploration. Stimulation of vibrissae over this frequency range modulates the pattern of activity in thalamic and cortical neurons, and, at the level of the cortical map, focuses the extent of the vibrissa representation relative to lower frequency stimulation (1 Hz). These findings suggest that one function of whisking is to reset cortical organization to improve tactile discrimination. Recent discoveries in primary visual cortex (VI) demonstrate parallel non-linearities in center-surround interactions in rat SI and VI, and provide a model for the rapid integration of multi-vibrissa input. The studies discussed in this article suggest that, despite its original conception as a uniquely segregated cortex, rat SI has a wide array of dynamic interactions, and that the study of this region will provide insight into the general mechanisms of cortical dynamics engaged by sensory systems.","The past decade has witnessed the remarkable ascendance of chemokines as pivotal regulatory molecules in cellular communication and trafficking. Evidence increasingly implicates chemokines and chemokine receptors as plurifunctional molecules that have a significant impact on the CNS. Initially, these molecules were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of many important neuroinflammatory diseases that range from multiple sclerosis and stroke to HIV encephalopathy. However, more-recent studies have fuelled the realization that, in addition to their role in pathological states, chemokines and their receptors have an important role in cellular communication in the developing and the normal adult CNS. For example, stromal-cell-derived factor 1, which is synthesized constitutively in the developing brain, has an obligate role in neurone migration during the formation of the granule-cell layer of the cerebellum. Many chemokines are capable of directly regulating signal-transduction pathways that are involved in a variety of cellular functions, which range from synaptic transmission to growth. Clearly, the potential use of chemokines and their receptors as targets for therapeutic intervention in CNS disease might now have to be considered in the context of the broader physiological functions of these molecules.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2000 Jan;23(1):39.,"In the nervous system, Ca2+ signalling is determined primarily by voltage-gated Ca2+-selective channels in the plasma membrane, but there is increasing evidence for involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores in such signalling. It is generally assumed that neurotransmitter-elicited release of Ca2+ from internal stores is primarily mediated by Ins(1,4,5)P3, as originally discovered in pancreatic acinar cells. The more-recently discovered Ca2+-releasing messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), which activates ryanodine receptors, has so far only been implicated in a few cases, and the possible importance of another Ca2+-releasing molecule, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), has been ignored. Recent investigations of the action of the brain-gut peptide cholecystokinin on pancreatic acinar cells have indicated that NAADP and cADPR receptors are essential for Ca2+ release. Tools are available for testing the possible involvement of NAADP and cADPR in neurotransmitter-elicited intracellular Ca2+ release, and such studies could reveal complex mechanisms that control this release in the nervous system.",,,,Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1999 Dec;22(12):following 568.,"Many HIV-1-positive individuals suffer from a variety of neurological problems known collectively as the HIV-1-related cognitive-motor complex. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie HIV-1-induced neuropathology are unclear. They might include a combination of indirect effects, which result from the release of neurotoxins from activated astrocytes and microglia, and the direct effects of HIV-1-related proteins, such as gp120, on neurons. As the interaction of gp120 with immune cells has been shown to require the participation of chemokine receptors, this article explores the possibility that such receptors participate in the events underlying HIV-1-induced neuropathology. It is now clear that many types of cell in the brain possess chemokine receptors, including microglia, glia and neurons, and the interaction of gp120 with neuronal chemokine receptors initiates apoptotic death of neurons in vitro. Such effects might be modified by the actions of chemokines that act at these same receptors. However, the importance of this direct interaction with neurons in vivo and its relevance in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related dementia still needs to be established. Furthermore, the existence of chemokine receptors on neurons suggests that chemokines might regulate neuronal functions physiologically.","It is well established that protein phosphorylation has an important role in synaptic plasticity. This is achieved, in part, via the presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. In recent years, the increase in information available about proteins that are involved in synaptic exocytosis and endocytosis has been exploited in order to study the effects of protein phosphorylation on synaptic-vesicle cycling at the molecular level. The best-characterized protein in this respect is synapsin, whose function in the release of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool is regulated by phosphorylation. More recently, it has emerged that proteins that function at other stages of the synaptic-vesicle cycle, which include priming of vesicles for docking-fusion and endocytic recycling, are also controlled by phosphorylation. Furthermore, recent work suggests that this regulation of membrane traffic by phosphorylation also occurs postsynaptically, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity.","Glutamatergic synapses vary, exhibiting EPSCs of widely different magnitudes and timecourses. The main contributors to this variability are: presynaptic factors, including release probability, quantal content and vesicle composition; factors that modulate the concentration and longevity of glutamate in the cleft, including diffusion and the actions of glutamate transporters; and postsynaptic factors, including the types and locations of ionotropic glutamate receptors, their numbers, and the nature and locations of associated intracellular signalling systems.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Apr;23(4):152-3.,"Mis-sense mutations of presenilin 1 increase the release of amyloidogenic peptide from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are a major cause of familial Alzheimer's Disease. Loss-of-function mutations of presenilins in the mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila result in severe developmental defects caused by disturbed Notch signalling. Recent studies suggest that the diverse biological roles of presenilin 1 can be explained at the molecular level by its role in the proteolytic cleavage of the integral membrane domains of Notch and APP. This cleavage is a central switch in Notch signalling, while, for APP, its physiological role remains elusive. Evidence that presenilin 1 itself has catalytic properties could explain many of the biological and biochemical alterations caused by presenilin-1 deficiency or clinical mutations in presenilin 1. However, as presenilins reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and the cleavage of Notch and APP is believed to occur close to the cell membrane, the scientific field now faces a 'spatial paradox'.",,"Songbirds exhibit some of the most extreme sex differences in the brain of all vertebrates. Understanding the function of these sex differences has relied on making interspecies comparisons. In some species, females sing rarely or not at all, and the brain nuclei that control song are many times larger in volume in males than in females. In other species, males and females sing approximately equally, and the sizes of the brain nuclei that control song are approximately equal between the sexes. This article reviews sex differences in the song-control system of songbirds, and introduces statistical comparative methods developed by evolutionary biologists. These methods control for phylogenetic effects while comparing the co-evolution of traits. The extreme sex differences in song seem to have co-evolved with the extreme sex differences in singing behavior in songbird species.","Hieronymus Bosch and other early Renaissance artists depicted 'stone operations' in which stones were supposedly surgically removed from the head as a treatment for mental illness. These works have usually been interpreted either as portraying a contemporary practice of medical charlatans or as an allegory of human folly, rather than a real event. As trepanation for head injury and mental disease was actually carried out in Europe at this time, another interpretation of these works is that they are derived from a common medical practice of the day.","In two articles by Wolf Singer, published in TINS in 1994 and 1997, brief analyses were presented of the problems faced by the European neuroscience community in its attempt to provide a cohesive response to meet the challenge of the proclamation of the 'Decade of the Brain'. One of the most-important decisions was to promote a forum for European neuroscience that, among other activities, would hold bi-annual meetings, alternating with meetings of partner European neuroscience societies in the intervening year. The first fruit of this was the enormously successful meeting held in Berlin in June 1998. The next meeting, the FENS millennium meeting, will be held in Brighton, UK (24-28 June 2000).","Corticosteroid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex protect the brain against adverse events and are essential for cognitive performance. However, in recent literature, the central action of corticosteroids has mostly been portrayed as damaging and disruptive to memory formation. We argue that this paradox can be explained by appreciating the specific role of both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the various stages of information processing. In addition, the context in which corticosteroid-receptor activation takes place is crucial in determining steroid-mediated effects. These effects generally favour adaptive behaviour that is most relevant to the situation. Corticosteroid effects on cognition can, however, turn from adaptive into maladaptive, when actions via the two corticosteroid-receptor types are imbalanced for a prolonged period of time.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Sep;23(9):410-1.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 Feb;23(2):57-8.

This article reviews experiments showing that these signals regulate the survival and differentiation of other cells in early nerves. The evidence indicates that glial-derived signals are necessary for neuronal survival at crucial periods of development, that they regulate the molecular and functional specialization of axons and that they control the maturation of the perineurial sheath that protects nerves from inflammation and unwanted macro-molecules produced in the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, an autocrine survival circuit enables Schwann cells in postnatal nerves to survive in the absence of axons, a vital requirement for successful nerve regeneration following injury. The molecular identity of these signals and their receptors is currently being determined.","Activation of the complement system has been reported in a variety of inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative processes of the CNS. Recent evidence indicates that complement proteins and receptors are synthesized on or by glial cells and, surprisingly, neurons. Among these proteins are the receptors for the chemotactic and anaphylactic peptides, C5a and C3a, which are the most-potent mediators of complement inflammatory functions. The functions of glial-cell C3a and C5a receptors (C3aR and C5aR) appear to be similar to immune-cell C3aRs and C5aRs. However, little is known about the roles these receptors might have on neurons. Indeed, when compared with glial cells, neurons display a distinct pattern of C3aR and C5aR expression, in either the normal or the inflamed CNS. These findings suggest unique functions for these receptors on neurons.","Brain injury following transient or permanent focal cerebral ischaemia (stroke) develops from a complex series of pathophysiological events that evolve in time and space. In this article, the relevance of excitotoxicity, peri-infarct depolarizations, inflammation and apoptosis to delayed mechanisms of damage within the peri-infarct zone or ischaemic penumbra are discussed. While focusing on potentially new avenues of treatment, the issue of why many clinical stroke trials have so far proved disappointing is addressed. This article provides a framework that can be used to generate testable hypotheses and treatment strategies that are linked to the appearance of specific pathophysiological events within the ischaemic brain.",,,,,,,,"The JAK -STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling pathway that is stimulated by cytokines has been much investigated in haematopoietic cells, but recent data indicate that this pathway is also present and active during neuronal and glial differentiation. Furthermore, it is now clear that growth factors other than the classical cytokines can act through this pathway and that physiological inhibitors of this signalling cascade exist. Thus, the JAKs, the STATs and their specific inhibitors could be molecules with important roles in the CNS.","It would be of enormous benefit if human neural tissue could be generated in vitro as this would allow screening for neuroactive compounds, and provide a source of tissue for testing cellular and gene therapies for CNS disorders. It is now well established that pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ES cells) from the mouse can be propagated in culture and differentiated into a range of tissues, including neuronal and glial cells. In other studies, more-restricted neural stem cells have been isolated from both the developing and adult rodent brain. Current reports now describe similar pluripotent and neural stem cells cultured from human embryos. While the exact nature of these cells continues to be explored, they can be grown for extended periods of time while retaining the capacity for neuronal and glial differentiation. In some cases, they have been shown to integrate into the developing or damaged adult brain. This article reviews their biology, with a focus on the possible links between ES-cell and neural stem-cell technologies, and the strategies used to isolate and expand defined cell populations.","There are pluripotent stem cells in the adult brain that might not be very different from those found in bone marrow. Recent and profound advances in the field of neuropoiesis, which often rely on insights from studies of hematopoiesis and in some instances use cross-paradigms with this field, have already revealed that bone marrow has much in common with so-called 'brain marrow'. Proliferative primogenitors and developmentally regulated molecules are hallmarks of both neuropoiesis and hematopoiesis. This article will focus on recent advances in neuropoiesis within a central core of the mature brain that is referred to as brain marrow, discussing its pluripotency and proliferative capacity, in vitro and molecular assays used in its study, and markers of neuropoietic stem/progenitor cells. As hematopoiesis research has led to the discovery of numerous morphogenetic factors, it is anticipated that studies of neuropoiesis should also uncover many new factors and genes that affect the growth and differentiation of neural cells. Recent breakthroughs in the stem-cell field prompt an inclusion of rationale for the persistence of normal stem/progenitor cells even in the aged brain. By analogy with hematopoiesis research, a thorough investigation of brain marrow should provide basic insights into developmental and persistent neurogenesis while anticipating cell-transplant and gene therapies for debilitating neurological diseases.","The neocortex and thalamus are a unified oscillatory machine. Different types of brain rhythms, which characterize various behavioral states, are combined within complex wave-sequences. During the stage of sleep that is associated with low-frequency and high-amplitude brain rhythms, the excitatory component of a cortically generated slow oscillation is effective in triggering thalamically generated rhythms and in increasing their spatiotemporal coherence over widespread territories. Thus, the study of coherent oscillations, as they appear naturally during states of vigilance in animals and humans, requires intact-brain preparations in which the neocortex and thalamus engage in a permanent dialog. Sleep oscillations are associated with rhythmic spike-bursts or spike-trains in thalamic and cortical neurons, which lead to persistent excitability changes consisting of increased depolarizing responses and decreased inhibitory responses. These short-term plasticity processes could be used to consolidate memory traces acquired during wakefulness, but can also lead to paroxysmal (hypersynchronous) episodes, similar to those observed in some epileptic seizures.",,,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Dec;22(12):543.,"Vertebrate motoneurons show considerable diversity in their soma locations, axonal trajectories and innervation targets. Results from studies of a variety of vertebrate species as well as fruit-flies are elucidating the mechanisms by which this diversity is generated. Motoneuron subpopulations appear to be defined by combinations of transcription factor genes expressed in distinct spatiotemporal patterns in both motoneuron progenitors and postmitotic motoneurons. Notochord-derived signals can induce motoneuron formation, paraxial-mesoderm-derived signals can pattern motoneuron subpopulations along the rostrocaudal body axis, and local signals within the neural tube can regulate the number and time at which motoneurons form. Additional, later signals can promote formation of proper central circuitry and motoneuron survival. The identification of the genes and signals responsible for regulating these processes should help to provide a more-detailed understanding of motoneuron patterning.","CART peptides are novel, putative brain-gut neurotransmitters and co-transmitters that probably have a role in drug abuse, the control of feeding behavior, sensory processing, stress and development. They are abundant, processed and apparently released. Exogenously applied peptides cause inhibition of feeding and have neurotrophic properties. Although the precise sequences, relative abundance and efficacy of all CART peptides are currently being determined, small molecules that are active at putative CART receptors could have substantial therapeutic promise.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2000 May;23(5):195-7.,,"The limitation of immune responsiveness in the mammalian CNS has been attributed to the intricate nature of neuronal networks, which would appear to be more susceptible than other tissues to the threat of permanent disorganization when exposed to massive inflammation. This line of logic led to the conclusion that all forms of CNS inflammation would do more harm than good and, hence, the less immune intervention the better. However, mounting evidence indicates that some forms of immune-system intervention can help to protect or restore CNS integrity. We have shown that the innate immune system, represented by activated macrophages, can facilitate the processes of regeneration in the severed spinal cord. More recently, we found that autoimmune T cells that are specific for a component of myelin can protect CNS neurons from the catastrophic secondary degeneration, which extends traumatic lesions to adjacent CNS areas that did not suffer direct damage. The challenge, therefore, is to learn how to modify immune interactions in the traumatized CNS in order to promote its post-injury maintenance and repair.","A wide heterogeneity in dendritic-spine morphology is observed and ultrastructural changes can be induced following experimental stimulation of neurons. Morphological adaptation of a given spine might, thus, reflect its history or the current state of synaptic activity. These changes could conceivably result from rearrangements of the cytoskeleton that is subjacent to excitatory synapses. This article dicusses the direct and indirect interactions, between glutamate receptors and the cytoskeletal proteins, which include PDZ-containing proteins, actin and tubulin, as well as associated proteins. In fact, the synaptic-activity-controlled balancing of monomeric, dimeric and polymeric forms of actin and tubulin might underlie the changes in spine shape. These continuous adaptations could be relevant for physiological events, such as learning and the formation of memory.",,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Dec;22(12):540-1. Trends Neurosci. 1999 Dec;22(12):541-3.,,"The adult CNS provides a poor environment for axonal growth and regeneration. The question of to what extent the loss of axonal growth occurring as the brain matures is dependent on factors intrinsic or extrinsic to the growing neuron is still unanswered. Examination of axonal growth from neural transplants provides insight into the roles of growth factors, inhibitory molecules, growth-promoting substrates and the differences between CNS and PNS environments in the regulation of neurite extension. The data that imply a role for BCL2 and related molecules in such processes are reviewed in this article, which analyzes the factors intrinsic to the neuron that control its capacity for axonal growth.","The three divisions of the ear (outer, middle and inner) each have an important role in hearing, while the inner ear is also crucial for the sense of balance. How these three major components arise and coalesce to form the peripheral elements of the senses of hearing and balance is now being studied using molecular-genetic approaches. This article summarizes data from studies of knockout and mutant animals in which one or more divisions of the ear are abnormal. The data confirm that development of all three divisions of the ear depends on the genes involved in hindbrain segmentation and segment identity. Genes that are regionally expressed in the inner ear can, when absent or mutated, yield selective ablation of specific inner-ear structures or cell types.","A major aim of neurobiology today is to improve understanding of the signaling pathways that couple rapid events, such as the action potential and neurotransmitter release, to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and increased neuronal survival. These adaptations involve interactions of neurons with other cells and with the extracellular matrix. They use, in part, the same molecular machinery that controls adhesion, motility or survival in non-neuronal cells. This machinery includes two homologous non-receptor tyrosine kinases, FAK and PYK2/CAKbeta, and the associated SRC-family tyrosine kinases. Specific brain isoforms of FAK with distinct properties are regulated by neurotransmitters, whereas PYK2/CAKbeta is highly sensitive to depolarization. The multiplicity of the pathways that can be activated by these tyrosine kinases indicates their importance in signal transduction in the adult brain.","Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by abnormal involuntary movements (chorea), intellectual impairment and selective neuronal loss. The expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat (the sequence CAG that codes for glutamine) to a length that exceeds 40 repeat units in exon 1 of the gene, HD, correlates with the onset and progression of the disease. The protein encoded by HD, huntingtin, is normally localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the mutant protein is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that its translocation to this site is important for the pathogenesis of HD. Although several proteins that interact with huntingtin have been identified in vitro, the significance of these interactions with the mutant protein in the pathogenesis of HD has yet to be determined. Recent progress in the development of cellular and animal models for the disease have provided invaluable insights and resources for studying the disease mechanisms underlying HD, and will be useful for screening and evaluating possible therapeutic strategies.","A comparative analysis of the area of the cortex that is adjacent to the primary visual area (V1), indicates that the lateral extrastriate cortex of primitive mammals was likely to contain only a single visuotopically organized field, the second visual area (V2). Few, if any, other visual areas existed. The opposing hypothesis, that primitive mammals had a 'string' of small visual areas in the cortex lateral to V1 (as in some rodents), is not supported by studies of the organization of extrastriate cortex in other mammals, nor by the variability in this organization among extant rodents. A critical re-analysis of published evidence on the presence of multiple areas adjacent to V1 in some rodents has led to alternative interpretations of the organization of the areas in these regions.",,,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Oct;22(10):436-7; author reply 438. Trends Neurosci. 1999 Oct;22(10):437-8.,"In the hippocampal formation GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have a major role in the synchronization of neuronal activity and are involved in the generation of large-scale network oscillations. Thus, interneurons function as a 'clock' that dictates when principal cells fire during suprathreshold excitatory drive. Interneurons receive strong excitatory innervation from glutamatergic neurons and it has been much debated whether these synapses show mechanisms of long-term plasticity similar to those found at principal-cell synapses. Recent findings support the lack of conventional forms of LTP and LTD in most interneurons, partly owing to the distinct anatomical and neurochemical features of interneuronal excitatory synapses. The uncommon properties of excitatory synapses on interneurons might be required for their functioning as accurate and reliable neuronal oscillators.","During learning and development, neural circuitry is refined, in part, through changes in the number and strength of synapses. Most studies of long-term changes in synaptic strength have concentrated on Hebbian mechanisms, where these changes occur in a synapse-specific manner. While Hebbian mechanisms are important for modifying neuronal circuitry selectively, they might not be sufficient because they tend to destabilize the activity of neuronal networks. Recently, several forms of homeostatic plasticity that stabilize the properties of neural circuits have been identified. These include mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability, stabilize total synaptic strength, and influence the rate and extent of synapse formation. These forms of homeostatic plasticity are likely to go 'hand-in-glove' with Hebbian mechanisms to allow experience to modify the properties of neuronal networks selectively.","According to the classical view of the nervous system, the numerically superior glial cells have inferior roles in that they provide an ideal environment for neuronal-cell function. However, there is a wave of new information suggesting that glia are intimately involved in the active control of neuronal activity and synaptic neurotransmission. Recent evidence shows that glia respond to neuronal activity with an elevation of their internal Ca2+ concentration, which triggers the release of chemical transmitters from glia themselves and, in turn, causes feedback regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic strength. In view of these new insights, this article suggests that perisynaptic Schwann cells and synaptically associated astrocytes should be viewed as integral modulatory elements of tripartite synapses.","Williams syndrome (WMS) is a rare sporadic disorder that yields a distinctive profile of medical, cognitive, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics. The cognitive hallmark of WMS is a dissociation between language and face processing (relative strengths) and spatial cognition (profound impairment). Individuals with WMS also tend to be overly social, behavior that is opposite to that seen in autism. A genetic hallmark of WMS is a deletion on chromosome band 7q11.23. Williams syndrome is also associated with specific neuromorphological and neurophysiological profiles: proportional sparing of frontal, limbic and neocerebellar structures is seen using MRI; and abnormal functional organization of the neural systems that underlie both language and face processing is revealed through studies using event-related potentials. The non-uniformity in the cognitive, neuromorphological and neurophysiological domains of WMS make it a compelling model for elucidating the relationships between cognition, the brain and, ultimately, the genes.",,,Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1999 Jul;22(7):302.,"New methods for identifying chromosomal regions containing genes that affect murine responses to alcohol and drugs have been used to identify many provisional quantitative trait loci (QTLs) since 1991. By 1998, 24 QTLs had been definitively mapped (P<5x10(-5)) to specific murine chromosomes, which indicates the presence of a relevant gene or genes at each location. The syntenic (homologous) region of the human genome for these genes is often known. For many mapped QTLs, candidate genes with relevant neurobiological function lie within the mapped region. Data that implicate candidate genes for specific responses include studies of knockout animals. Current strategies for gene identification include the use of congenic strains containing QTL regions introduced from another strain. There is increasing emphasis on gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in such studies.","The EGR family of transcription regulatory factors, which is implicated in orchestrating the changes in gene expression that underlie neuronal plasticity, has attracted the attention of both molecular and systems neuroscientists. In this article, the advances made in both these fields of research are reviewed. Recent systems-based studies underscore the remarkable sensitivity and specificity of the induction of the expression of genes encoding EGR-family members in naturally occurring plasticity paradigms. However, they also challenge conventional views of the role of this family in plasticity. Recent molecular studies have identified the gonadotropin subunit, luteinizing hormone beta, as an EGR1-regulated gene in vivo and uncovered an essential role for EGR3 in muscle-spindle development. In addition, the discovery of novel proteins that are capable of suppressing EGR-mediated transcription cast doubt over the prevalent assumption that changes in EGR mRNA or protein levels provide an accurate measure of EGR-driven transcriptional activity.","It is widely accepted that the modulation of the presynaptic Ca2+ influx is one of the main mechanisms by which neurotransmitter release can be controlled. The well-identified cholinergic synapse in the buccal ganglion of Aplysia has been used to study the modulations that affect presynaptic Ca2+ transients and to relate this to quantal evoked neurotransmitter release. Three types of Ca2+ channel (L, N and P) are present in the presynaptic neurone at this synapse. Influxes of Ca2+ through N- and P-type channels trigger the release of ACh with only N-type Ca2+ channels being regulated by presynaptic neuromodulator receptors. In addition, presynaptic Ca2+ stores, via complex mechanisms of Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release, control the Ca2+ concentration that triggers this evoked ACh release.","Fifty years ago C.A.G. Wiersma established that the giant axons of the crayfish nerve cord drive tail-flip escape responses. The circuitry that includes these giant neurons has now become one of the best-understood neural circuits in the animal kingdom. Although it controls a specialized behavior of a relatively simple animal, this circuitry has provided insights that are of general neurobiological interest concerning matters as diverse as the identity of the neural substrates involved in making behavioral decisions, the cellular bases of learning, subcellular neuronal computation, voltage-gated electrical synaptic transmission and modification of neuromodulator actions that result from social experience. This work illustrates the value of studying a circuit of moderate, but tractable, complexity and known behavioral function.","Unexpected stimuli that are behaviourally significant have the capacity to elicit a short-latency, short-duration burst of firing in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones. An influential interpretation of the experimental data that characterize this response proposes that dopaminergic neurones have a crucial role in reinforcement learning because they signal error in the prediction of future reward. In this article we propose a different functional role for this 'short-latency dopamine response' in the mechanisms that underlie associative learning. We suggest that the initial burst of dopaminergic-neurone firing could represent an essential component in the process of switching attentional and behavioural selections to unexpected, behaviourally important stimuli. This switching response could be a crucial prerequisite for associative learning and might be part of a general short-latency response that is mediated by catecholamines and prepares the organism for an appropriate reaction to biologically significant events. Any act which in a given situation produces satisfaction becomes associated with that situation so that when the situation recurs the act is more likely than before to recur also. E.L. Thorndike (1911) 1.",,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Nov;22(11):495-6. Trends Neurosci. 1999 Nov;22(11):496-7.,"Three types of neuronal organization can be called 'brain maps': sets of feature-sensitive cells, ordered projections between neuronal layers and ordered maps of abstract features. The latter are most intriguing as they reflect the central properties of an organism's experiences and environment. It is proposed that such feature maps are learned in a process that involves parallel input to neurons in a brain area and adaptation of neurons in the neighborhood of the cells that respond most strongly to this input. This article presents a new mathematical formulation for such adaptation and relates it to physiological functions.","The auditory system determines the location of stimuli based on the evaluation of specific cues. The analysis begins in the tonotopic pathway, where these cues are processed in parallel, frequency-specific channels. This frequency-specific information is processed further in the midbrain and in the forebrain by specialized, space-processing pathways that integrate information across frequency channels, creating high-order neurons tuned to specific locations in space. Remarkably, the results of this integrative step are represented very differently in the midbrain and forebrain: in the midbrain, space is represented in maps, whereas, in the forebrain, space is represented in clusters of similarly tuned neurons. We propose that these different representations reflect the different roles that these two brain areas have in guiding behavior.","The murine homologs of the orthodenticle (otd) gene of Drosophila, Otx1 and Otx2, have an important role in brain morphogenesis. Analysis of Otx1 and Otx2 null mice reveals that Otx1 is required primarily for corticogenesis and sense-organ development,while Otx2 is necessary for specification and maintenance of anterior neural plate as well as for proper gastrulation. Cross-phylum recoveries of Otx1 abnormalities by Drosophila otd, and vice versa, indicate that genetic functions required in mammalian-brain development evolved in a primitive ancestor of flies and mice. Knock-in mouse models in which Otx2 was replaced with Otx1, and vice versa, provide evidence that the existence of Otx1-/- and Otx2-/- divergent phenotypes largely reflects differences in expression patterns rather than in the biochemical activity of OTX1 and OTX2. In evolutionary terms, some of these findings lead us to hypothesize a fascinating and crucial role for Otx genes that contributes to the genetic program required for the specification of the development of the vertebrate head.","Research in the fields of cellular communication and signal transduction in the brain has moved very rapidly in recent years. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the latest discoveries in the arena of messenger molecules. Current evidence indicates that, in visual system, NO is produced in both postsynaptic and presynaptic structures and acts as a neurotransmitter, albeit of a rather unorthodox type. Under certain conditions it can switch roles to become either neuronal 'friend' or 'foe'. Nitric oxide is a gas that diffuses through all physiological barriers to act on neighbouring cells across an extensive volume on a specific time scale. It, therefore,has the opportunity to control the processing of vision from the lowest level of retinal transduction to the control of neuronal excitability in the visual cortex.","The mechanisms that underlie a wine lover's ability to identify a favorite vintage and a dog's ability to track the scent of a lost child are still deep mysteries. Our understanding of these olfactory phenomena is confounded by the difficulty encountered when attempting to identify the parameters that define odor stimuli, by the broad tuning and variability of neurons in the olfactory pathway,and by the distributed nature of olfactory encoding. These issues pertain to both biological systems and to newly developed 'artificial noses' that seek to mimic these natural processes. Information theory, which quantifies explicitly the extent to which the state of one system (for example, the universe of all odors) relates to the state of another (for example, the responses of an odor-sensing device),can serve as a basis for analysing both natural and engineered odor sensors. This analytical approach can be used to explore the problems of defining stimulus dimensions, assessing strategies of neuronal processing, and examining the properties of biological systems that emerge from interactions among their complex components. It can also serve to optimize the design of artificial olfactory devices for a variety of applications, which include process control, medical diagnostics and the detection of explosives.",,,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Jul;22(7):300; author reply 301-2. Trends Neurosci. 1999 Jul;22(7):300-2.,Erratum in Trends Neurosci 2000 Jan;23(1):43.,"It is now well established that neuropeptide receptors, which are present throughout the CNS and in peripheral tissues, frequently exist in a variety of different forms (called subtypes), each of which is encoded by a distinct gene. With the recent identification of new neuropeptide genes, it has become clear that families of neuropeptides also occur, which raises the possibility that specific peptide ligands activate particular receptor subtypes preferentially. This article reviews some of the recent advances in the neuropeptide field and provides evidence in support of three ideas: (1) that different receptor subtypes for a given ligand can be distinguished physiologically; (2) that neuropeptide genes probably arose before the corresponding receptor genes; and (3) that, despite the current wealth of information on neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors, several new members are likely to be discovered before the beginning of the next millennium.","The auditory cortex has a crucial role in higher cognitive functions, including the perception of speech, music and auditory space. Cortical plasticity, as in other sensory systems, is used in the fine tuning of the auditory system for these higher functions. Auditory cortical plasticity can also be demonstrated after lesions of the cochlea and it appears to participate in generating tinnitus. Early musical training leads to an expansion in the representation of complex harmonic sounds in the auditory cortex. Similarly, the early phonetic environment has a strong influence on speech development and, presumably, on the cortical organization of speech. In auditory spatial perception, the spectral cues generated by the head and outer ears vary between individuals and have to be calibrated by learning, which most probably takes place at the cortical level. The neural mechanisms of plasticity are likely to be the same across all cortical regions. It should be useful, therefore, to relate some of the findings and hypotheses about auditory cortical plasticity to previous studies of other sensory systems.","Cholinergic neurons originating in the basal forebrain innervate all cortical areas and participate in the gating of cortical information processing. Aberrations in the excitability of cortical cholinergic inputs fundamentally alter the processing of sensory stimuli and higher processes, thereby advancing the development of major neuropsychiatric disorders. Cortical cholinergic deafferentation has been considered to be a major neuropathological variable that contributes to the development of age- and dementia-associated impairments in cognition. Conversely, it has been suggested that increases in the excitability of cortical cholinergic inputs mediate the abnormal cognitive processes that escalate into psychotic symptoms and contribute to addictive-drug-seeking behavior, anxiety and phobia. Abnormal regulation of the excitability of cortical cholinergic afferents represents a 'final common pathway' that mediates the manifestation of major neuropsychiatric disorders.","Neuropeptides are essential for the regulation of appetite and body weight within the hypothalamus. The understanding of the neuropeptide regulation of energy homeostasis has been greatly advanced by the recent discovery of leptin, the protein product of the obese gene (ob). Significant new insights into the relationship between peripheral adiposity signals and their impact on the hypothalamic neuropeptide signaling circuitry have provided some crucial missing links in the negative-feedback regulation of appetite and body weight. The neuropeptide Y orexigenic network is a final common pathway for this signaling cascade and, along with feeding-inhibitory neuropeptides such as melanocortin, corticotropin-releasing factor and glucagon-like peptide 1, it is a major target through which leptin exerts a regulatory tonic restraint on body adiposity.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Sep;24(9):504-6.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of these disorders are only partially understood. On a cellular level, focal mononuclear-cell infiltration with demyelination and eventual axonal loss is a crucial pathogenetic event that leads to inflammation and subsequent dysfunction. Here, the evidence that integrins, a family of cell adhesion molecules, expressed on neural and immune cells might play a central role in immune cell recruitment to the CNS and PNS, and probably in tissue repair is reviewed. Distinct integrin expression patterns are observed in multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Therapeutic targeting of integrins has been very successful in the corresponding animal models and holds promise as a novel treatment strategy to combat human immune-mediated disorders of the nervous system.","The high concentration of the tyrosine-rich polypeptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and the increase in the number of its receptor subtypes that have been characterized in the brain, raise the question of a functional role for NPY in the CNS. In addition to its peripheral actions on cardiovascular regulation, much attention has, therefore, been devoted to the CNS effects of NPY because of its stimulatory properties on food intake, its role in anxiolysis and its putative involvement in memory retention. Emerging evidence points to an important role for NPY in the regulation of neuronal activity both under physiological conditions and during pathological hyperactivity such as that which occurs during seizures. This article reviews recent studies that have shown the changes induced by seizures in the level and distribution of NPY, its receptor subtypes and their respective mRNAs in rat forebrain. Biochemical and electrophysiological findings in experimental models and tissue from human epilepsy sufferers suggest that NPY-mediated neurotransmission is altered by seizures. The pharmacological evidence and functional studies in NPY knockout mice highlight a crucial role for endogenous NPY, acting on different NPY receptors, in the control of seizures.","Nematodes include both free-living species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and major parasites of humans, livestock and plants. The apparent simplicity and uniformity of their nervous system belies a rich diversity of putative signalling molecules, particularly neuropeptides. This new appreciation stems largely from the genome-sequencing project with C. elegans, which is due to be completed by the end of 1998. The project has provided additional insights into other aspects of nematode neurobiology, as have studies on the mechanism of action of anthelmintics. Here, progress on the identification, localization, synthesis and physiological actions of transmitters identified in nematodes is explored.","Evidence is accumulating that suggests that Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM) and the protein kinase Cs (PKCs) obstruct each other's actions because of the embedding of PKC phosphorylation sites in CaM or Ca2+-CaM-binding domains of a growing number of crucial substrates in neurons (and other cells). These substrates include the CaM storage proteins (neurogranin, neuromodulin), the membrane-associated MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate) protein, the NMDA receptor RI subunit and the autoinhibitory domain of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. In this review, the emerging data are woven into a hypothetical picture of the conflicting, timing-dependent convergence of two major signalers on neuronal functions.","Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in an ATP-binding-cassette transporter located in the peroxisomal membrane, which result in a fatal demyelinating disease in boys and a milder phenotype in men and some heterozygous women. There is no molecular signature to indicate a particular clinical course. The underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease have yet to be targeted clinically. Is the increase in very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) the disease trigger? Why is there no phenotype in ALD null mice that show this increase? Do VLCFA destabilize human myelin, once formed, and lead to the inflammation seen in this genetic disease? Bone-marrow transplantation might save a child by providing normal brain macrophages and allowing myelin regeneration early in disease. The processes that underlie ALD challenge neuroscientists to elucidate peroxisomal transporter functions in the nervous system and to pursue the gene-transfer strategies leading to remyelination until a preventive therapy emerges.",,"Synaptic changes that underlie associative learning and memory begin with temporally related activity of two or more independent synaptic inputs to common postsynaptic targets. In turn, temporally related molecular events regulate cytosolic Ca2+ during progressively longer-lasting time domains. Associative learning behaviors of living animals have been correlated with changes of neuronal voltage-dependent K+ currents, protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation and synthesis of the Ca2+ and GTP-binding protein, calexcitin (CE),and increased expression of the Ca2+-releasing ryanodine receptor (type II). These molecular events, some of which have been found to be dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease, provide means of altering dendritic excitability and thus synaptic efficacy during induction, consolidation and storage of associative memory. Apparently, such stages of behavioral learning correspond to sequential differences of Ca2+ signaling that could occur in spatially segregated dendritic compartments distributed across brain structures, such as the hippocampus.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1999 Feb;22(2):80.,"Covalent binding of ubiquitin to proteins marks them for degradation by the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway. This pathway plays a major role in the breakdown of abnormal proteins that result from oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and mutations. Failure to eliminate ubiquitinated proteins disrupts cellular homeostasis, causing degeneration. Inclusions containing ubiquitinated proteins are commonly detected in many neurological disorders. These aggregates are mostly cytosolic; nevertheless, ubiquitinated inclusions are found in endosomes/lysosomes in Alzheimer's disease and prion encephalopathies, and in nuclei in disorders associated with CAG/polyglutamine repeats, such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. Ubiquitinated aggregates must result from a malfunction or overload of the ubiquitin/ATP-dependent pathway or from structural changes in the protein substrates, halting their degradation. Prevention of protein aggregation in these diseases might offer new therapeutic leads.","Golgi ranked the peripheral reticulum--which adheres intimately to nerve cell surfaces--alongside the intracellular reticulum, or Golgi apparatus,which immortalized his name. At first dismissed as an artefact of capricious staining techniques, this peripheral reticulum, or perineuronal net, is now recognized as a genuine entity in neurocytology. It represents a complex of extracellular matrix molecules interposed between the meshwork of glial processes, from which they are indistinguishable, and nerve-cell surfaces. In no other branch of neuroscience has the waxing and waning of interest in any morphological entity been so pronounced as in the case of the perineuronal net. This review traces the history of this enigmatic structure from its conception to the present time, brings to light the keen observational powers of morphologists at the turn of the century and reveals how their sagacious forethought anticipated current thinking on the role of perineuronal nets.","Memory impairments, which occur regularly across species as a result of aging, disease and psychological insults (for example, stress), constitute a useful area for investigation into the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. Memory researchers have identified the hippocampus as a crucial brain structure involved in key aspects of memory formation. The most widely accepted putative mechanisms of memory storage in this structure are LTP and LTD. The hippocampus is enriched with receptors for corticosterone (a glucocorticoid hormone released in response to stress) and it plays a role in glucocorticoid negative feedback and, therefore, some hippocampal functioning might be particularly susceptible to stress. In support of this view, stress-induced modifications in learning, synaptic plasticity and endangerment of neurons have been seen in the hippocampus. Stress and glucocorticoids appear to exert a metaplastic effect through the modulation of Ca2+ levels. We propose a synaptic model that provides a conceptual scaffold to structure our understanding of the manifold actions of stress on the hippocampus. Accordingly, we suggest that stress-induced metaplasticity could disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis and thus endanger hippocampal neurons.",,"It has been postulated frequently that the fundamental organization of the basal ganglia (BG) in vertebrates arose with the appearance of amniotes during evolution. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that such a condition was already present in early anamniotic tetrapods and, therefore, characterizes the acquisition of the tetrapod phenotype rather than the anamniotic-amniotic transition. Re-examination of the BG organization in tetrapods in the light of recent findings in amphibians strongly supports the notion that elementary BG structures were present in the brain of ancestral tetrapods and that they were organized according to a general plan shared today by all extant tetrapods.","Recently, two large multigene families of putative G-protein-linked receptors that are expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurones in the vomeronasal organ have been identified. These receptors probably mediate pheromone detection. The most surprising aspects of these findings are that there are so many receptors of two very different classes and that the receptors are unrelated to their counterparts in the main olfactory epithelium. This suggests that many active ligands are likely to exert effects through the vomeronasal organ. Parallel experiments addressing the nature of these ligands indicate a role for some proteins, as well as small molecules, as functional mammalian pheromones. In combination, these results begin to suggest a molecular basis for mammalian pheromone signalling.","In mammalian systems, SH2-containing cytoplasmic signalling molecules are known to play an important role in determining cell responsiveness to the environment. In particular, following activation of a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK), proteins like Shc and Grb2 bind to phosphotyrosine residues of stimulated receptors, thereby activating downstream components of specific signalling pathways. The ShcA gene was identified in 1992 and was found to encode three proteins with properties of adaptor molecules coupling RPTKs to Ras. Early data obtained in non-neuronal cells have revealed that Shc and Grb2 proteins are highly expressed and activated in all cells. However, recent analyses of ShcA mRNA and protein in the developing brain revealed progressive downregulation of their expression during differentiation from neuroblasts to neurons. Conversely, the two newly identified Shc homologues (ShcB/Sli and ShcC/Rai) are highly expressed in the mature brain.Thus, variations in the intracellular levels of adaptor proteins might represent one of the mechanisms by which a differentiating cell changes its ability to respond to a given factor, allowing a cell to choose between proliferation and differentiation.","Most human seizures occur early in life,consistent with established excitability-promoting features of the developing brain. Surprisingly, the majority of developmental seizures are not spontaneous but are provoked by injurious or stressful stimuli. What mechanisms mediate'triggering' of seizures and limit such reactive seizures to early postnatal life? Recent evidence implicates the excitatory neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Stress activates expression of the CRH gene in several limbic regions, and CRH-expressing neurons are strategically localized in the immature rat hippocampus, in which this neuropeptide increases the excitability of pyramidal cells in vitro. Indeed, in vivo, activation of CRH receptors--maximally expressed in hippocampus and amygdala during the developmental period which is characterized by peak susceptibility to 'provoked' convulsions--induces severe, age-dependent seizures. Thus, converging data indicate that activation of expression of CRH constitutes an important mechanism for generating developmentally regulated, triggered seizures, with considerable clinical relevance.","What is neuroinformatics? What is the Human Brain Project? Why should you care? Supported by a consortium of US funding agencies, the Human Brain Project aims to bring to the analysis of brain function the same advantages of Internet-accessible databases and database tools that have been crucial to the development of molecular biology and the Human Genome Project. The much greater complexity of neural data, however, makes this a far more challenging task. As a pilot project in this new initiative, we review some of the progress that has been made and indicate some of the problems, challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.","Important advances in experimental methods have made it possible to measure the electrical events in dendrites directly and to record optically from dendritic spines. These new techniques allow us to focus on the input region of the neuron and highlight the excitable properties of the dendritic membrane. Interestingly, some of the recent experimental findings were anticipated by earlier theoretical research, for example, the observation that some spines possess excitable channels that might generate local all-or-none events. Computer models were used previously to explore the conditions for initiating an action potential at the dendritic tree, in particular, at the spine head, and for active propagation between excitable spines and excitable dendritic arbors. The consequences for synaptic amplification, for the extent of active spread in the tree and for non-linear discriminations between different patterns of synaptic inputs were also considered. Here we review the biophysical insights gained from the theory and demonstrate how these elucidate the recent experimental results.",,"Axonal insulation is of key importance for the proper propagation of action potentials. In Drosophila and other invertebrates, it has recently been demonstrated that septate junctions play an essential role in axonal insulation or blood-brain-barrier formation. Neurexin IV, a molecular component of Drosophila septate junctions, has been shown to be essential for axonal insulation in the PNS in embryos and larvae. Interestingly, a vertebrate homolog of Neurexin IV, caspr--also named paranodin--has been shown to localize to septate-like junctional structures. These vertebrate junctions are localized to the paranodal region of the nodes of Ranvier, between axons and Schwann cells. Caspr/paranodin might play an important role in barrier formation, and link neuronal membrane components with the axonal cytoskeletal network.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Mar;22(3):108-9.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Mar;22(3):108-9.,"Abundant tau-positive neurofibrillary lesions constitute a defining neuropathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Filamentous tau pathology is also central to a number of other dementing disorders, such as Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and familial frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). The discovery of mutations in the tau gene in FTDP-17 has firmly established the relevance of tau pathology for the neurodegenerative process. Experimental studies have provided a system for the assembly of full-length tau into Alzheimer-like filaments, providing an assay for the testing of compounds that inhabit the formation of tau filaments.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Feb;22(2):61.,,"The hereditary ataxias are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive ataxia that results from degeneration of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections. Recent molecular research has led not only to the discovery of a number of causative mutations, but also shed light on the likely mechanisms by which these mutations cause the respective phenotypes. In Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common type of autosomal recessive ataxia, the loss of a mitochondrial protein, frataxin, results in overload of mitochondrial iron and oxidative stress. The autosomal dominant ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAI), SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7, are caused by inheritance of an unstable, expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat. These disorders are assumed to be due to a novel deleterious function of the extended polyglutamine sequences within the proteins encoded by the respective genes. Recent observations in transgenic mice and in human post-mortem tissue suggest that the extended proteins are transported into the nucleus of neurons where they form intranuclear inclusions that disrupt normal nuclear function. In another group of dominant disorders, episodic ataxia type I and type 2 (EA-I, EA-2) and SCA6, the mutations affect genes that code for ion channels.","The adult olivocerebellar axons and their terminal arbours, the climbing fibres, are capable of remarkable structural plasticity, regulated through their interaction with Purkinje cells. When these cells are deleted,terminal climbing fibre branches retract. In contrast,there is a vigorous outgrowth of entire terminal arbours when extra postsynaptic neurones are available. The new connections lead to a functional, highly specific pattern of innervation at the single Purkinje cell level and are topographically organized according to the principles of the original projection map.A reversible climbing fibre retraction occurs following depression of electrical activity of the cerebellar cortex. These remarkable plastic properties, together with the fact that these neurones express several growth-associated genes constitutively, suggest that the climbing fibre synapses might be adjusted dynamically to participate in physiological plasticity.","In the past decade there have been advances in understanding the cellular mechanisms of the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum. This review first summarizes current views on mechanisms involved in LTD induction, from activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, of ionotropic (AMPA) and metabotropic (mGluRI) glutamate receptors, to stimulation of protein kinase C and nitric oxide formation. Second, we will focus on recent findings that point towards the involvement of Ca2+ release from internal stores in LTD induction, localize the sources and targets of nitric oxide and indicate a postsynaptic site for LTD expression. Finally, a role for LTD in motor learning is now well supported by recent experiments on transgenic mice.","The inferior olive, which provides the climbing fibers to Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, has been implicated in various functions, such as learning and timing of movements, and comparing intended with achieved movements. For example, climbing-fiber activity could transmit error signals during eye-blink conditioning or adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, or it could carry motor command signals beating on the rhythm of the oscillating and synchronous firing of ensembles of olivary neurons, or both. In this review, we approach the controversial issue of olivocerebellar function from the perspective of the unique organization of the microcircuitry of the olivary neuropil. The characteristic glomeruli are formed by a core of long dendritic or axonal spines, each of which is innervated by both an inhibitory terminal derived from the hindbrain and an excitatory terminal derived from either an ascending or descending input. The dendritic spines, which originate from dendrites with varicosities carrying dendritic lamellar bodies, are coupled by gap junctions. By drawing a comparison with a computational model by Segev and Rall,which might be applicable to the typical olivary spine with its unique morphological features and combined excitatory and inhibitory input, we propose that the microcircuitry of the inferior olive is capable of functioning both in motor learning and motor timing, but does not directly compare intended with achieved movements.","The analysis of patterned gene expression has been an important tool for dissecting the molecular and developmental bases of functional compartmentalization in the mammalian cerebellum. In particular, sagittally-oriented cellular aggregates arranged along the mediolateral axis are the patterning element most commonly invoked to illustrate cerebellar compartmentalization, and these are revealed both by patterns of afferent projection and by a number of classical biochemical markers that are distributed in a pattern of'zebra stripes'. Compartmentation along both the mediolateral and rostrocaudal axes might be linked mechanistically to segmentation in the fruit fly, since early cerebellar development is especially dependent upon the expression of mammalian homologs of Drosophila segmentation genes. In addition, as has been demonstrated in the retinotectal system, some of these genes are likely to control positional information required for the sagittal organization of cerebellar afferent projections. However, in contrast to these global or macro zones, the cerebellum is also compartmentalized at the subcellular or micro level. This can be visualized by differential patterns of mRNA distribution within the sole cerebellar efferent system, the Purkinje cell, defining within such cells a number of distinct subcellular domains or 'postal zones'. The global versus subcellular levels of cerebellar compartmentalization are related since they both appear to be linked to patterns of afferent innervation.A major goal of cerebellar research will be to unravel the true nature of such a relationship, and its relevance to function and behavior.","The molecular underpinnings of cerebellar development are being established through the identification of naturally occurring mutated genes and the knockout of other genes. Sets of genes expressed in the regions of the mes- and metencephalon have been shown to play a crucial role in specifying the cerebellar anlage. Other genes have been shown to be crucial to early granule-cell development, migration of Purkinje and granule cells, and neuron-glia interactions. However, the process of development will ultimately be understood in terms of cellular interactions and the roles that each cell type plays in the assembly of cerebellar structure. One of the most important interactions is between granule and Purkinje cells. This relationship has been shown to be crucial for the control of cell number, migration of neuroblasts and cell differentiation.","Vertebrate cerebella occupy a position in the rostral roof of the 4th ventricle and share a common pattern in the structure of their cortex. They differ greatly in their external form, the disposition of the neurones of the cerebellar cortex and in the prominence of their afferent, intrinsic and efferent connections.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Dec;21(12):509.,"In nerve cells,the short-lived signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) is generated by Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated NO synthases. Nitric oxide activates soluble guanylate cyclase in target cells, leading to the formation of cGMP. Biochemical investigations have shown the presence of a Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated NO-cGMP signalling mechanism in the nervous system of insects. Using NADPH-diaphorase staining as a marker for the enzyme NO synthase and an antiserum against cGMP,the cellular organization of NO donor and target cells has so far been resolved in the locust and fruit fly. This paper provides an overview of the cellular organization of NO signalling in the insect nervous system as well as highlighting its functions in olfactory information processing, formation of olfactory memory, vision, and neuronal development. The resolution of discrete donor and NO-responsive target cells in the developing nervous system of Drosophila will facilitate the genetic and pharmacological analysis of NO-cGMP signal transduction.","Beginning with the first step of visual processing and proceeding outward from that point, the neurons involved in different aspects of vision are distinct. Stated simply, neurons doing different things look different. They often display distinct morphological features and they usually express different molecules. In addition, neurons that perform a common function usually aggregate together to form recognizable layers or compartments that can be studied in isolation because they are neurochemically distinct. Here is found, then, a junction of two major domains in neuroscience research, as discovery of molecular diversity among neurons is exploited to study organization and function of the primate visual system.","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane is a major pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling in neurones, but little is known about the molecular machinery that orchestrates the process. The amphiphysin protein has recently emerged into the limelight since its discovery in 1992 as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein. It was subsequently found to interact in vitro with the GTPase dynamin through its SH3 domain. However, only in the past year has its role in endocytosis been confirmed, with the demonstration that the introduction of dominant-negative-acting SH3 domains into living cells causes a potent blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This, together with the discovery by several groups of a second nerve terminal-enriched amphiphysin isoform, and the finding that the two proteins heterodimerize, further suggests that the amphiphysins are closely connected with dynamin-mediated vesicle budding. This review summarizes current views in the field, and draws on data that suggest intriguing alternative roles--including possible involvement in the cytoskeleton and in tumour suppression--for certain members of the amphiphysin family.","In the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the neurodegenerative changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge about this disease is based mainly on studies of inherited forms of AD, although most cases of AD are of the non-familial type. Recently, a novel type of mutation in 'vulnerable' dinucleotide repeats in messenger RNA was discovered in AD patients: in this type of mutation a mutated transcript is produced from a correct DNA sequence, a process that we call 'molecular misreading'. The resulting mutated '+1 proteins' are prominent neuropathological hallmarks of AD and they are present in most elderly non-demented people also. This suggests that the dinucleotide deletions in transcripts could be one of the earliest events in the neuropathogenesis of AD and an important factor in normal aging.",Comment on Trends Neurosci. 1999 May;22(5):207-8.,"The hippocampus has long been thought to be an important cortical region for associative learning and memory. After several decades of experimental and theoretical studies, a picture is emerging slowly of the generic types of learning tasks that this neural structure might be essential for solving. Recently, there have been attempts to unify electrophysiological and behavioral observations from rodents performing spatial learning tasks with data from primates performing various tests of conditional and discrimination learning. Most of these theoretical frameworks have rested primarily on behavioral observations. Complementing these perspectives,we ask the question: given certain physiological constraints at the neuronal and cortical level, what class of learning problems is the hippocampus, in particular, most suited to solve? From a computational point of view, we argue that this structure is involved most critically in learning and memory tasks in which discontiguous items must be associated, in terms of their temporal or spatial positioning, or both.",,"Neural and behavioural analyses have shown that the formation of filial preferences in young, precocial birds involves at least two separate processes. One process is an emerging predisposition to approach stimuli with the characteristics of the natural mother. The other (learning) process of filial imprinting results in chicks preferentially-approaching a stimulus to which they have been exposed and involves forming links between the components of the exposed stimulus. The neural substrate for the predisposition is different from that underlying imprinting, and different regions of the chick brain are involved in distinct aspects of learning about imprinting stimuli.","To understand the neural bases of memory it is necessary to localize the regions storing information. Part of the hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) serves such a function for the learning process of imprinting in domestic chicks. Chicks exposed to an object learn its characteristics, and in doing so, the responsiveness of IMHV neurones to that object is selectively enhanced. Imprinting is associated with both pre- and postsynaptic changes in the region. Postsynaptic changes involve increases in the length of the postsynaptic density on dendritic spines and in the numbers of NMDA receptors; presynaptically, converging evidence points to an early and persistent enhancement of neurotransmitter release. Increases in the amounts of certain neural cell adhesion molecules a day after training might serve to stabilize the synaptic changes associated with a particular memory by strengthening pre- to postsynaptic adhesion, and by more strongly interconnecting the cytoskeletal frameworks of the dendritic spine and the synaptic terminal. Learning-related increases in the number of neurones staining positive for the transcription factor Fos in the IMHV give promise of identifying the neurones engaged in memory functions and of analysing their connections.","Neuroscience is witnessing growing interest in understanding brain mechanisms of memory formation for emotionally arousing events, a development closely related to renewed interest in the concept of memory consolidation. Extensive research in animals implicates stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex as key, interacting modulators of memory consolidation for emotional events. Considerable evidence suggests that the amygdala is not a site of long-term explicit or declarative memory storage, but serves to influence memory-storage processes in other brain regions, such as the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex. Human-subject studies confirm the prediction of animal work that the amygdala is involved with the formation of enhanced declarative memory for emotionally arousing events.","ATP-sensitive K+ channels couple cell metabolism to electrical activity in nerve, muscle and endocrine cells, and play important roles in these tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions. The KATP channel is an octameric complex of two unrelated types of subunit: a pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2) and a regulatory subunit, the sulphonylurea receptor (SUR). This review focuses on the regulation of KATP channel activity by nucleotides and cell metabolism and considers which regulatory mechanisms are intrinsic to Kir6.2 and which are conferred by association with SUR.","The hereditary neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 1A is, in the majority of cases, caused by duplication of the gene for the peripheral myelin protein PMP22, which leads to abnormally increased PMP22 expression. Recent in vitro and in vivo data indicate a novel function of PMP22 in Schwann-cell growth and differentiation other than its role in myelination, and suggest that overproduction of PMP22 leads to a new Schwann-cell phenotype in CMT1A. Taking these data into account, we developed a new hypothesis on the pathogenesis of CMT1A neuropathy: that the defective myelin stability and turnover observed in the disease is caused by altered PMP22 gene dosage and its resultant effect on abnormal Schwann-cell growth and differentiation.","Swallowing problems can affect as many as one in three patients in the period immediately after a stroke. In some cases this can lead to serious morbidity, in particular malnutrition and pulmonary aspiration. Despite this, swallowing usually recovers completely in the vast majority of patients within weeks. This impressive propensity for recovery is likely to relate to how the area of the motor cortex concerned with swallowing is organized and then reorganized after cerebral injury. Recent studies have indicated that swallowing has a bilateral but asymmetric inter-hemisphere representation within motor and premotor cortex. Damage to the hemisphere that has the greater swallowing output appears to predispose that individual to swallowing problems. However, because there is additional substrate for swallowing in the undamaged hemisphere, the capacity for compensatory reorganization in the contralateral motor cortex might be increased, leading to a greater likelihood of recovery. Swallowing might be an excellent system for studying cortical plasticity, and might prove useful in the development of new therapies aimed at accelerating reorganization in the undamaged hemisphere after unilateral cerebral injury.","The current view of the role of GABAergic interneurones in cortical-network function has shifted from one of merely dampening neuronal activity to that of an active role in information processing. In this review, we explore a potential role of hippocampal GABAergic interneurones in providing spatial and temporal conditions for modifications of synaptic weights during hippocampus-dependent memory processes. We argue that knowledge of spatiotemporal activity patterns in distinct classes of interneurone is essential to understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory.","In mature rodents, whisker-related patterns are known to be present in three levels of the brain: the brainstem trigeminal nuclei, the ventrobasal thalamus and the somatosensory cortex. These patterns have been demonstrated using neuroanatomical tracing techniques, histological and histochemical staining methods and electrophysiological recordings. The development and topography of these patterns are dependent on an intact periphery. But what governs when patterns form at the three levels? Possibilities include a controlling signal from the periphery or local mechanisms at each site, such as the arrival of afferent inputs or the maturation of target tissue. In this review, we report on the maturation of the whisker pathway in a marsupial, the wallaby, where the slow tempo of development is a feature. At each level, afferent fibres grow into the region of termination many weeks before the whisker-related pattern emerges. The results suggest that the maturity of the target tissue as well as signals from the periphery combine to trigger pattern formation at each level of the pathway.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Aug;21(8):365.,"Very different areas of the primate cortex have been labelled as 'vestibular'. However, no clear concept has emerged as to where and how the vestibular information is processed in the cerebral cortex. On the basis of data from single-unit recordings and tracer studies, the present article gives statistical evidence of the existence of a well-defined vestibular cortical system. Because the data presented here have been verified in three different primate species, it can be predicted that a similar vestibular cortical system also exists in humans.","Synuclein proteins are produced, in vertebrates, by three genes. They share structural resemblance to apolipoproteins, but are abundant in the neuronal cytosol and present in enriched amounts at presynaptic terminals. Synucleins have been specifically implicated in three diseases:Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and breast cancer. In AD, a peptide derived from alpha-synuclein forms an intrinsic component of plaque amyloid. In PD, an alpha-synuclein allele is genetically linked to several independent familial cases, and the protein appears to accumulate in Lewy bodies. In breast cancer, increased expression of gamma-synuclein correlates with disease progression. In songbirds, alpha-synuclein expression is correlated with plasticity in the developing song control system. Although the normal function of synucleins is unknown, a role in membrane plasticity seems likely.","In the brain, conversion of androgens into estrogens by the enzyme aromatase (estrogen synthase) is a key mechanism by which testosterone regulates many physiological and behavioral processes, including the activation of male sexual behavior, brain sexual differentiation and negative feedback effects of steroid hormones on gonadotropin secretion. Studies on the distribution and regulation of brain aromatase have led to a new perspective on the control and function of this enzyme. A growing body of evidence indicates that the estrogen regulation of aromatase is, at least in part, trans-synaptic. Afferent catecholamine pathways appear to regulate aromatase activity in some brain areas and thereby provide a way for environmental cues to modulate this enzyme. The localization of aromatase in pre-synaptic boutons suggests possible roles for estrogens at the synapse.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Aug;21(8):335.,"Investigation in neurophysiology usually involves measurements of large population-average signals or small sample recordings. There is an underlying assumption that the observations express activity of large groups of similarly acting neurons that is the result of a bottom-up scenario in which individual cells, via their synaptic interactions, lead to the large scale phenomena. The connection between the levels must be provided by theory, which must also provide the relevant variables for observation. It is suggested that between the experiment and the full theory there is a creative, mixed role for simulation: both experimental and theoretical. A simulation presents complex dynamics and hence is an empirical board for testing theoretical tools, yet its controlled behaviour can make predictions about the biological system.","Axon guidance by gradients plays an important role in wiring up the developing nervous system. Growth cones seem to sense a concentration difference across their spatial extent, and convert this into a signal to move up or down a gradient. In this article, a simple mathematical framework is developed to understand when and where gradient detection can occur as a function of gradient shape. This framework is applied to two examples:the guidance of axons by target-derived diffusible factors in vivo and in collagen gels, and guidance by substrate-bound gradients of optimal shape, as might be relevant in the retinotectal system.Two distinct spatial limits on guidance emerge: I mm for a target-derived diffusible gradient, and I cm for a substrate-bound gradient.",,"The publication of the delta opioid receptor sequence led to the cloning of three homologous receptors: the mu and kappa opioid receptors, and a novel opioid-like orphan receptor. The orphan receptor's endogenous ligand, a 17-amino-acid peptide that resembles dynorphin, was named 'orphanin FQ' and 'nociceptin' (OFQ/N1-17). The OFQ/N1-17 receptor is expressed widely in the nervous system, and it is becoming clear that the peptide is likely to participate in a broad range of physiological and behavioral functions. At the cellular level, OFQ/N1-17 has much in common with the classical opioids; however, functional studies are now revealing distinct actions of this peptide. Identified only two years ago, OFQ/N1-17 has already attracted a great deal of attention. The number and diversity of papers focused on OFQ/N1-17 at the recent meeting of the Society for Neuroscience augur an exciting future for this new peptide.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Nov;21(11):469-70.,"Steroid hormones influence the electrical activity of many neurons and effectors by regulating the transcription of their ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, or by modulating the activity of their channels and receptors through second messenger-coupled membrane receptors, or both. In this article, four cell types with known functions and distinct electrical activities are focused on to illustrate how different steroids act synergistically with, or in opposition to, each other to modulate specific electrical phenomena such as spontaneous regular firing (GH3 cells, a pituitary cell line), action potential duration (electric organ cells), and intrinsic excitability and sensitivity to neurotransmitters (GnRH and opioidergic neurons).These examples illustrate how steroids might influence electrical activity in neurons involved in more complex central circuits.","A century ago, Camillo Golgi discovered in neurons an intracellular network of anastomosing threads, impregnated by the chromoargentic reaction he had devised to stain the nervous tissue. This structure, designated by Golgi as 'internal reticular apparatus', was soon detected in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells. However, skepticism arose on the existence of the Golgi apparatus in the first decades of this century, when it was fiercely debated whether this structure represented a genuine new cell constituent or an artifact due to the deposit of metallic impregnation on diverse cytoplasmic structures. The reality of the Golgi apparatus became established unequivocally only with the application of electron microscopy; with the visualization of its fine structure, the apparatus finally achieved the status of cytoplasmic organelle, and thus, linked with Golgi's name, entered the modern era of investigation on its components, chemistry and function.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Apr;22(4):151-2.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1999 Jun;22(6):255-6.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Dec;21(12):515.,,"Repetitive sensory input, stroboscopic lights or repeated sounds can induce epileptic seizures in susceptible individuals. In order to understand the process we have to consider multiple factors. The output of a set of neurones is determined by the amount of excitatory synaptic input, the degree of positive feedback and their inherent electrical excitability, which can be modified by synaptic inhibition. Recent research has shown that it is possible to separate these phenomena, and that they do not always behave in unison.","As sensory cells, hair cells within the mammalian inner ear convert sounds into receptor potentials when their projecting stereocilia are deflected. The organ of Corti of the cochlea contains two types of hair cell, inner and outer hair cells, which differ in function. It has been appreciated for over two decades that although inner hair cells act as the primary receptor cell for the auditory system, the outer hair cells can also act as motor cells. Outer hair cells respond to variation in potential, and change length at rates unequalled by other motile cells. The forces generated by outer hair cells are capable of altering the delicate mechanics of the cochlear partition, increasing hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity. The discovery of such hair-cell motility has modified the view of the cochlea as a simple frequency analyser into one where it is an active non-linear filter that allows only the prominent features of acoustic signals to be transmitted to the acoustic nerve by the inner hair cells. In this view, such frequency selectivity arises through the suppression of adjacent frequencies, a mechanical effect equivalent to lateral inhibition in neural structures. These processes are explained by the interplay between the hydrodynamic interactions among different parts of the cochlear partition and the effective non-linear behaviour of the cell motor.","Hematogenous leukocytes infiltrate the CNS after inflammatory stimuli, including infection, mechanical trauma and excitotoxic neuronal necrosis. However,the role of leukocytic inflammation in promoting or hindering tissue repair is poorly understood. Identification of signals that lead to leukocyte recruitment and activation is essential for the designing of interventions that modulate inflammation, thus improving neurological outcome. Chemokines are small pleiotropic chemoattractant cytokines whose target specificity suggests an important role in determining the cellular composition of inflammatory infiltrates. Chemokine expression profiles in the CNS during autoimmune and post-traumatic inflammation correlate well with the composition of leukocyte infiltrates, and expression studies in systems such as transgenic mice, suggest that chemokines have potent functional attributes in CNS physiology. We propose that selective chemokine expression by CNS cells is crucial for post-traumatic leukocyte accumulation.","Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are heteromeric complexes found in the plasma membrane of virtually all cell types and show a high level of electrophysiological and pharmacological diversity. Associated with the pore-forming alpha 1 subunit are the membrane anchored, largely extracellular alpha2-delta, the cytoplasmic beta and sometimes a transmembrane gamma subunit; these subunits dramatically influence the properties and surface expression of these channels. Effects vary depending on subunit isoforms, suggesting that functional diversity of native channels reflects heterogeneity of combinations. Interaction sites between subunits have been identified and advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular basis of functional effects of the auxiliary subunits, their capacity to be regulated by G proteins, and their interaction with related cellular systems.","Rather than merely a nuisance, noise in biological systems is a useful property. Before patch-clamp methods were invented, analysis of membrane current noise provided the first solid, if indirect, evidence for the existence of ion-conducting pores with discrete conductance levels. Although supplanted by single-channel recording techniques for most tasks, analysis of current membrane noise remains useful for certain problems, such as determining the properties of channels with rapid kinetics that open with a high probability and desensitize, channels localized at synapses, channels with an unusually low unitary conductance and open-channel noise. In addition, the role of noise in information processing in the CNS is increasingly being recognized. In this article, we summarize the analysis of current membrane noise with an emphasis on what the technique is still useful for, and discuss the role for noise in information processing.","A defining feature of the vertebrate nervous system is the ensheathment of axons by myelin, a multilamellar membrane containing a small group of proteins and an abundance of the galactolipid galactocerebroside (GalC) and its sulfated derivative sulfatide. Several in vitro studies have suggested that these galactolipids transduce developmental signals, facilitate protein trafficking and stabilize membranes. In addition, mice lacking the ability to synthesize GalC or sulfatide form dysfunctional and unstable myelin. These findings suggest that the galactolipids are essential components of myelin, and that functional and structural properties of myelin result from the combined contributions of galactolipids and proteins.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Apr;21(4):175.,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily of cell-surface molecules can play the dual role of mediating either cytotoxicity or cell survival, both in the immune system and in the nervous system. A member of this superfamily, CD95 (also known as ApoI or Fas), was initially identified in the immune system and has been shown to mediate receptor-dependent programmed cell death and to be expressed in the nervous system. In neurodegenerative disorders, CD95-CD95 ligand expression on glial cells might precede receptor-mediated apoptosis by cells of the CNS. It is now being recognized that CD95 signaling by immune cells mediates effects other than apoptosis, such as cell survival and under inflammatory conditions expression of this protein promotes neural-immune interactions. Both neuroscientists and immunologists can contribute to defining the mechanisms underlying these divergent effects and utilize such knowledge to aid understanding of cell death and survival.","Structural brain repair has become a possibility with the identification and characterization of persistent neuronal progenitor cells in both the neonatal and adult brain. However, despite recent advances in the identification, propagation and expansion of these cells, they will not be useful therapeutically until methods are available for directing or delivering them to sites of need. As a result, the natural history and induction of neuronal migration into adult brain tissue has assumed new importance in clinical neurobiology. In this review we consider the cellular and molecular bases of neuronal migration into the postnatal forebrain. In particular, we discuss two natural paradigms of postnatal neuronal recruitment: radial-cell-directed neuronal migration to the songbird neostriatum, and neurophilic migration to the rodent olfactory bulb. In each, we will focus on the dynamic interactions between the migrants, their cellular guides and the local environment, and the effect of those interactions on migrational success.","Failure to obtain convincing results in psychiatric genetics can partly be attributed to the fact that progress in molecular biology and genetic epidemiology has not been followed by an equivalent development in phenotypic description. Instead of relying entirely on classical nosological approaches, we argue that identifying more homogeneous forms of diseases through a'candidate symptom approach' among affected subjects and an endophenotype approach that identifies sub-clinical traits among non-affected relatives might yield better results. Examples where these strategies have already been fruitful when applied to complex diseases are presented in this review. Focusing on vulnerability traits might stimulate the redefinition of traditional psychiatric syndromes and help to bridge the gap between clinical and experimental approaches.","Synaptic plasticity might be one of the elementary processes that underlies higher brain functions, such as learning and memory. Intriguingly, the capacity of a synapse for plastic changes itself displays marked variation or plasticity. This higher-order plasticity, or metaplasticity, appears to depend on the same macromolecules as plasticity, most notably the NMDA receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II; yet we do not understand metaplasticity in molecular terms. Metaplasticity has a feedback-inhibition character that confers stability to synaptic patterns, whereas in plasticity, the molecular events implicated tend to have an opposite effect. As a resolution to this difference, we suggest that metaplasticity be considered in a biophysical context. It has been shown that autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II in postsynaptic densities generates changes in the local electrostatic potential sufficient to affect the direction of synaptic plasticity. We propose that this finding could help explain both the puzzling abundance of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II in the postsynaptic density and the metaplasticity of synaptic transmission.",,,"Our appreciation of the relationship between synaptic structure and function, and in particular our understanding of quantal synaptic transmission, is derived from classical studies on the neuromuscular junction. However, physiological studies of quantal transmission at mammalian CNS synapses have produced a variety of results, and thus no consensus of opinion has emerged. This variability could be due, in part, to experimental and analytical limitations or to differences in the structural and functional features of central synapses, or both. Some of the experimental limitations have recently been overcome by the use of novel preparations that permit direct measurement of quantal synaptic events in the CNS. Although these studies reveal similarities between the synaptic mechanisms of the neuromuscular junction and CNS synapses, important differences and specializations are also evident. The purpose of this review is to highlight the structural and functional diversity of synapses in the mammalian CNS, and to discuss the potential relevance of structural features to synaptic function.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 2001 Jan;24(1):8-9.,"A number of studies have implicated the neurohypophyseal peptides oxytocin and vasopressin in the central mediation of complex social behaviors, including affiliation, parental care and territorial aggression. Research on a monogamous rodent, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), suggests that these neuropeptides are also involved in the control of several behaviors associated with monogamy, including pair bonding, paternal care and mate guarding. Comparative studies using several species of vole have identified species-specific patterns of oxytocin- and vasopressin-receptor expression in the brain that appear to be associated with a monogamous versus non-monogamous social structure. Molecular studies suggest that changes in the regulation of oxytocin- and vasopressin-receptor gene expression underlie these species differences in receptor distribution and might provide a mechanism for the evolution of monogamy in voles.","The dual origin, structural organization, and evolving ascending stratification of the mammalian neocortex are explored from a developmental perspective. Layer I and subplate (layer VII) zone of the neocortex evolve first from a primordial plexiform neuropil that is established throughout the non-olfactory telencephalon and that is common to amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The remaining laminations (strata) of the neocortex evolve later, between layer I and the subplate zone, from the cortical plate (CP), which represents a multilayered mammalian evolutionary feature. The attraction of CP neurons towards layer I, their progressive ascending (inside-out) placement, common early differentiation stage (regardless of size, location, cortical depth, or eventual functional role, or all of these), and the unique morphologic features of its pyramidal neuron are developmental processes controlled by layer I and its Cajal-Retzius cells. Based on the role of these early neurons and of layer I, a new theory of neocortical cytoarchitectonics and nomenclature is proposed to explain the basic structural and functional organization of the mammalian neocortex, the morphology of its pyramidal cells, and the addition of new pyramidal cell strata that characterize its phylogenetic evolution.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 May;21(5):201.,"Oxyradicals attack double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes in a process called membrane lipid peroxidation (MLP).This process occurs in many different acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, and to a lesser extent during normal physiological activity in neuronal circuits. It can modify neurotransmitter release and uptake, ion-channel activity, the function of ion-motive ATPases and glucose transporters,and the coupling of cell-surface receptors to GTP-binding proteins. MLP can also impair mitochondrial function and promote a cascade of events that culminates in apoptotic cell death. The lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal might play a central role in MLP-induced alterations in plasma membrane and mitochondrial protein functions. The modification of processes such as outgrowth of neurites and long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission by agents that suppress or promote MLP suggests roles for subtoxic levels of MLP in neuronal plasticity.","Beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is found in diffuse and focal deposits throughout the brain from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Another feature of AD is the widespread degeneration and dysfunction of the basal-forebrain cholinergic system. Until now, it has been unclear how these features of AD might be related. Recent reports, however, suggest that Abeta can potently inhibit various cholinergic neurotransmitter functions independently of apparent neurotoxicity. This capacity of Abeta might contribute to the vulnerability of selected cholinergic neuronal populations in AD. Moreover, the high potency (picomolar to nanomolar concentrations) of these effects and the secretion of Abeta by brain cells indicate that Abeta-induced cholinergic hypoactivity might have physiological in addition to pathological significance.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Aug;21(8):337-8.,"There are two views as to the character of basal-ganglia processing - processing by segregated parallel circuits or by information sharing. To distinguish between these views, we studied the simultaneous activity of neurons in the output stage of the basal ganglia with cross-correlation techniques. The firing of neurons in the globus pallidus of normal monkeys is almost always uncorrelated. However, after dopamine depletion and induction of parkinsonism by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), oscillatory activity appeared and the firing of many neurons became correlated. We conclude that the normal dopaminergic system supports segregation of the functional subcircuits of the basal ganglia, and that a breakdown of this independent processing is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.","The thalamic reticular nucleus can be divided into a number of sectors, each concerned with a different function (sight, touch, hearing, movement or 'limbic' functions). Each sector is connected to more than one thalamic nucleus and to more than one cortical area, and each sector has topographically mapped connections with the thalamus and the cortex. We consider the known details of these connections and show: (1) that they are not the same for each sector; (2) that the reticular nucleus serves as a nexus, where several functionally related cortical areas and thalamic nuclei can interact, modifying thalamocortical transmission through the inhibitory connections that go from the reticular cells to thalamic relay cells; and (3) that we need much more detailed information about these highly organized connections before we can understand exactly how the thalamic reticular nucleus might be influencing thalamocortical pathways in attentional mechanisms or in other, as yet undefined, roles.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Oct;21(10):426-7.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain characterized by the presence of neuritic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although it most frequently occurs in the elderly, this disorder also afflicts younger patients. The majority of AD cases are late in onset, lack an obvious genetic etiology and are characterized as sporadic, whereas a small percentage of cases are early in onset and segregate strongly within families (FAD), suggesting a genetic etiology. During the past decade it has become evident that the clinical and histopathological phenotypes of this disease are caused by heterogeneous genetic, and probably environmental, factors. Indeed, several genes have been identified that together appear to cause most of the familial forms of the disease, whereas the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the late onset forms of AD. Despite this evidence of heterogeneity, it has been suggested that all of these factors work through a common pathway by triggering the deposition of amyloid in the brain, which is ultimately responsible for the neuronal degeneration of AD. This is a controversial theory, however, primarily because there is a poor correlation between the concentrations and distribution of amyloid depositions in the brain and several parameters of AD pathology, including degree of dementia, loss of synapses, loss of neurons and abnormalities of the cytoskeleton.","In the mammalian brain most excitatory transmission is mediated by glutamate binding to AMPA and NMDA receptors. These receptors have markedly different biophysical properties, and at synapses in the CAI region of the hippocampus they play complementary roles in long-term potentiation (LTP): while postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation is necessary for the induction of this form of plasticity, AMPA receptors play a larger role in its expression. Recent studies in hippocampal slices have revealed a further striking difference in the behaviour of the two receptor types: NMDA receptors consistently sense a larger number of quanta of glutamate released from presynaptic terminals than do AMPA receptors. Two alternative explanations for this are either that AMPA receptors are functionally silent at a proportion of synapses (although they can be uncovered by LTP), or that glutamate can spill over from neighbouring synapses and selectively activate NMDA (but not AMPA) receptors. Both of these competing hypotheses have extensive implications for the mechanisms of expression of LTP. Extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion appears to depend critically on the recording temperature, but if excitatory synapses are sufficiently close for cross-talk to occur under physiological conditions, it could have profound implications for the specificity of synaptic communication in the brain.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Jul;21(7):286; author reply 287.,,"Operant conditioning of the vertebrate H-reflex, which appears to be closely related to learning that occurs in real life, is accompanied by plasticity at multiple sites. Change occurs in the firing threshold and conduction velocity of the motoneuron, in several different synaptic terminal populations on the motoneuron, and probably in interneurons as well. Change also occurs contralaterally. The corticospinal tract probably has an essential role in producing this plasticity. While certain of these changes, such as that in the firing threshold, are likely to contribute to the rewarded behavior (primary plasticity), others might preserve previously learned behaviors (compensatory plasticity), or are simply activity-driven products of change elsewhere (reactive plasticity). As these data and those from other simple vertebrate and invertebrate models indicate, a complex pattern of plasticity appears to be the necessary and inevitable outcome of even the simplest learning.","Motion provides one of the most important cues for survival, because it helps to break the camouflage of a predator or a prey and because it allows predictions about the future path of an object. Recent data on the processing of acoustic motion have yielded some astonishing findings, suggesting that the psychophysical, neurological and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the detection and representation of acoustic motion are quite similar to those underlying the detection and representation in other modalities, especially in vision. A further comparison of these similarities and differences with respect to the different environmental constraints posed for the different modalities may help in understanding general problems associated with motion computations.","Ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are distributed throughout the nervous systems of many insect species. As with their vertebrate counterparts, GABAA receptors and GABAC receptors, the binding of GABA to ionotropic insect receptors elicits a rapid, transient opening of anion-selective ion channels which is generally inhibitory. Although insect and vertebrate GABA receptors share a number of structural and functional similarities, their pharmacology differs in several aspects. Recent studies of cloned Drosophila melanogaster GABA receptors have clarified the contribution of particular subunits to these differences. Insect ionotropic GABA receptors are also the target of numerous insecticides and an insecticide-resistant form of a Drosophila GABA-receptor subunit has enhanced our understanding of the structure-function relationship of one aspect of pharmacology common to both insect and vertebrate GABA receptors, namely antagonism by the plant-derived toxin picrotoxinin.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Feb;21(2):80.,"The acute-phase reaction is the multisystem response to acute inflammation. The central nervous system (CNS) mediates a coordinated set of autonomic, endocrine and behavioral responses that constitute the cerebral component of the acute-phase reaction. However, the mechanisms of immune signaling of the CNS remain controversial. Emerging evidence indicates that different parts of the acute-phase reaction are initiated by distinct mechanisms and in different brain regions. Cytokines produced as a result of local infections (for example, in the abdominal or thoracic cavities) might activate vagal sensory fibers, resulting in sickness behavior and fevers. Additionally, circulating immune stimuli might activate meningeal macrophages and perivascular microglia along the borders of the brain, eliciting the local production of prostaglandins and responses such as fever, anorexia, sleepiness, and activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The biological importance of these responses might favor the existence of multiple parallel CNS pathways that are engaged by cytokines.","Recent studies have begun to unravel the brain mechanisms that underlie the mental representation of the body. Imitation of movements by neonates suggests an implicit knowledge of the body structure that antedates the adult body schema. This can include inanimate objects that bear systematic relations to the body, as shown by the elimination from self awareness of a body part and its associated paraphernalia after selective brain lesions. Dynamic aspects of the body schema are revealed by spontaneous sensations from a lost body part as well as by orderly phantom sensations elicited by stimulation of body areas away from the amputation line and even by visual stimulation. The mechanisms of the body schema exhibit stability, since some brain regions seem permanently committed to representing the corresponding body parts in conscious awareness, and plasticity, since brain regions deprived of their natural inputs from a body part become reactive to inputs from other body parts.","Studies of mechanisms of adaptive behavior generally focus on neurons and circuits. But adaptive behavior also depends on interactions among the nervous system, body and environment: sensory preprocessing and motor post-processing filter inputs to and outputs from the nervous system; co-evolution and co-development of nervous system and periphery create matching and complementarity between them; body structure creates constraints and opportunities for neural control; and continuous feedback between nervous system, body and environment are essential for normal behavior. This broader view of adaptive behavior has been a major underpinning of ecological psychology and has influenced behavior-based robotics. Computational neuroethology, which jointly models neural control and periphery of animals, is a promising methodology for understanding adaptive behavior.",,,"Neurons and other cells are regulated by a great multiplicity of neurotransmitters, modulators, hormones and other chemical messengers, which, through complex networks of extensively diverging and converging pathways, exert a multiplicity of effects. How do we analyze the functioning of such a complex network? If the effects of a transmitter depend on the presence of many other transmitters, how can we predict what they will be? If multiple transmitters act through the same network, how can their actions be specific? If they converge on the same effects, are some of the transmitters redundant? Why are there so many transmitters? Such questions can be addressed using an analytical approach that examines, qualitatively or quantitatively, how the operation of the network globally maps a multidimensional input space of transmitters to a multidimensional output space of effects.","Immortalized multipotent neural stem and progenitor cells have emerged as a highly convenient source of tissue for genetic manipulation and ex vivo gene transfer to the CNS. Recent studies show that these cells, which can be maintained and genetically transduced as cell lines in culture, can survive, integrate and differentiate into both neurons and glia after transplantation to the intact or damaged brain. Progenitors engineered to secrete trophic factors, or to produce neurotransmitter-related or metabolic enzymes can be made to repopulate diseased or injured brain areas, thus providing a new potential therapeutic tool for the blockade of neurodegenerative processes and reversal of behavioural deficits in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. With further technical improvements, the use of immortalized neural progenitors may bring us closer to the challenging goal of targeted and effective CNS repair.","The main ionotropic receptors (GABAA, NMDA and AMPA) display a sequential participation in neuronal excitation in the neonatal hippocampus. GABA, the principal inhibitory transmitter in the adult CNS, acts as an excitatory transmitter in early postnatal stage. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission is first purely NMDA-receptor based and lacks functional AMPA receptors. Therefore, initially glutamatergic synapses are 'silent' at resting membrane potential, NMDA channels being blocked by Mg2+. However, when GABA and glutamatergic synapses are coactivated during the physiological patterns of activity, GABAA receptors can facilitate the activation of NMDA receptors, playing the role conferred to AMPA receptors later on in development. Determining the mechanisms underlying the development of this 'ménage à trois' will shed light not only on the wide range of trophic roles of glutamate and GABA in the developing brain, but also on the significance of the transition from neonatal to adult forms of plasticity.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1998 Feb;21(2):52.,"Neurulation is a morphogenetic event par excellence. During this highly choreographed four-dimensional process, a flat sheet of ectoderm is transformed into an elongated tubular rudiment, the neural tube, which exhibits rostro-caudal and mediolateral regionalization. Many tissues interact during neurulation to induce and regionalize the neuroectoderm and to produce the morphogenetic forces that drive neurulation. Such forces are generated by fundamental cell behaviors such as changes in cell shape, position and number. In addition, morphoregulatory molecules expressed during neurulation underlie induction and patterning of the forming neuraxis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of neurulation, neural tube defects continue to be a major health care concern. Further research, utilizing a panoply of approaches, is necessary to resolve this issue. Thus, although we are beginning to come to closure in terms of understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for normal neural tube formation, 'coming to closure' is exactly the problem that requires resolution to prevent these devastating birth defects.","Brattleboro rats do not produce vasopressin (VP) because of a germ-line single-base deletion (di) that causes a frame shift downstream from the VP sequences and a loss of a stop codon. The resulting frame-shifted peptide precursor does not enter the secretory pathway in hypothalamic neurons, thereby blocking the neurosecretion of VP and other peptides. Yet, from birth onwards, a subpopulation of neurons in di/di rats slowly accumulates revertant cells with a hemizygous wild-type phenotype. Because the rate of reversion during aging is slowed by vasopressin infusion, it is of interest to consider these phenomena in relation to recent observations on 'adaptive' mutations in single cell bacteria and yeast that enable reversion of mutations that blocked cell division under conditions of nutrient deficits. In considering mechanisms that could produce revertant phenotypes in non-dividing cells of both pro- and eukaryotes, we note the pertinence of transcription-coupled repair and SOS 'error-prone' repair.",,"Adaptation to a changing environment is an essential feature of physiological regulation. The day-night rhythm is translated into hormonal oscillations governing the metabolism of all living organisms. In mammals the pineal gland is responsible for the synthesis of the hormone melatonin in response to signals originating from the endogenous clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The molecular mechanisms involved in rhythmic synthesis of melatonin involve the cAMP response element modulator (crem) gene, which encodes transcription factors responsive to activation of the cAMP signalling pathway. The CREM product, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), is rhythmically expressed and participates in a transcriptional autoregulatory loop that also controls the amplitude of oscillations of 5-HT N-acetyl transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Thus, a transcription factor modulates the oscillatory levels of a hormone.","Increasing evidence suggests that antagonistic interactions between specific subtypes of adenosine and dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia are involved in the motor depressant effects of adenosine receptor agonists and the motor stimulant effects of adenosine receptor antagonists, such as caffeine. The GABAergic striatopallidal neurons are regulated by interacting adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptors. On the other hand, the GABAergic striatonigral and striatoentopeduncular neurons seem to be regulated by interacting adenosine A1 and dopamine D1 receptors. Furthermore, behavioural studies have revealed interactions between adenosine A2A and dopamine D1 receptors that occur at the network level. These adenosine-dopamine receptor-receptor interactions might offer new therapeutic leads for basal ganglia disorders.","Basic research using cell transplantation indicates that structural developmental mechanisms seen in immature brains can also function in the adult brain. As the brain matures, cellular migration and axonal growth is impeded. However, fetal neural transplantation studies have shown that directional cues are available for fetal axons to find specific host neurons in the adult brain. By reaching specific and distant CNS target zones, donor tissue with extended axonal growth periods demonstrate both an abundance and specificity of CNS neurotropic signals. The presence of specific guidance cues, despite strong inhibition of regenerative long-distance axonal growth, suggests that these cues play other physiological roles in the adult CNS, and could be utilized therapeutically for reconnection of neuronal pathways.","Slices of CNS tissue prepared from young rodents can be maintained in culture for many weeks to months. The basic requirements are simple: a stable substratum, culture medium, sufficient oxygenation and incubation at a temperature of about 36 degrees C. Under these conditions, nerve cells continue to differentiate and to develop a tissue organization that closely resembles that observed in situ. Several alternative culturing methods have been developed recently. Slices maintained in stationary culture with the interface method are ideally suited for questions requiring a three-dimensional structure, whereas slices cultured in roller-tubes remain the method of choice for experiments that require optimal optical conditions. In this report, three typical experiments are discussed that illustrate the potential of the slice-culture technique. The first example indicates that, due to their high neuronal connectivity, slice cultures provide a very useful tool for studying the properties of synaptic transmission between monosynaptically coupled cell pairs. The other two studies show how long-term application of substances to slice cultures can be used to examine the consequences of epileptic discharges in vitro, as well as the effects of slowly acting clostridial neurotoxins on synaptic transmission.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Jun;21(6):241-2.,"The main questions in circadian neurobiology are: how many oscillators are involved; how are their daily oscillations generated and synchronized to the external world; and how do they signal time of day to the organism. The suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) are well established as the principal circadian oscillator of mammals. Their 10,000 or so 'clock' neurones drive our overt rhythms-the daily patterning we observe in our physiology and behaviour being mirrored perfectly by their spontaneous cycle of neuronal activity. However, they are not our only circadian oscillator, their molecular timekeeping is not understood and they ways in which they communicate with other parts of the brain are more unusual than was previously assumed.","Our thinking on the cortical organization of primate memory is undergoing a copernican change, from a neuropsychology that localizes different memories in different areas to one that views memory as a distributed property of cortical systems. We are shifting our focus from 'systems of memory' to the memory of systems. The same cortical systems that serve us to perceive and move in the world serve us to remember it. Our memories are networks of interconnected cortical neurons, formed by association, that contain our experiences in their connectional structure. Perceptual and motor memory networks are hierarchically organized in post-rolandic and pre-rolandic neocortex, respectively. Recall, recognition and working memory consist largely in their reactivation, also by association.",Erratum in Trends Neurosci 1997 Dec;20(12):577.,"Brain activity is associated with changes in optical properties of brain tissue. Optical measurements during brain activation can assess haemoglobin oxygenation, cytochrome-c-oxidase redox state, and two types of changes in light scattering reflecting either membrane potential (fast signal) or cell swelling (slow signal), respectively. In previous studies of exposed brain tissue, optical imaging of brain activity has been achieved at high temporal and microscopical spatial resolution. Now, using near-infrared light that can penetrate biological tissue reasonably well, it has become possible to assess brain activity in human subjects through the intact skull non-invasively. After early studies employing single-site near-infrared spectroscopy, first near-infrared imaging devices are being applied successfully for low-resolution functional brain imaging. Advantages of the optical methods include biochemical specificity, a temporal resolution in the millisecond range, the potential of measuring intracellular and intravascular events simultaneously and the portability of the devices enabling bedside examinations.",,"The stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) forms a network of peripheral ganglia associated with the insect gut. The SNS originates from a neuroepithelial placode which dissolves into a population of migrating neural precursors. The formation of the SNS presents many parallels to the development of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system. Recent studies have started to provide answers for pertinent questions in SNS development, in particular, how the SNS placode is specified, how SNS precursors are released in a reproducible pattern from this placode and how different cell types in the SNS are determined.","Several genes involved in the regulation of eye development in different species have been identified. Structural and functional conservation have been found between some of these genes in organisms as diverse as Drosophila and mouse. One notable example is the relationship between the mouse Pax6 gene and eyeless of Drosophila. Ectopic expression of eyeless or mouse Pax6 in Drosophila results in the formation of additional eyes. Recently, another homeobox gene, Six3, was found to promote ectopic lens formation in fish embryos. The next step will be to unravel the associated regulatory pathways of these genes and assess the degree to which they display evolutionary conservation. This will be important in order to assimilate these findings with current anatomical and embryological models. It seems reasonable to believe that in the near future the characterization of the whole framework required for vertebrate eye development will be accomplished.","High levels of expression of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) occur in neuronal tissues and play a strategic role in the modulation of short- and long-term functions (ion channels, receptor desensitization, neurotransmitter release and synaptic efficiency) that become modified during the brain ageing process. Recent studies have clarified the key role played by the anchoring proteins in mediating subcellular PKC location, that is, in driving the enzyme to specific sites of action. The protein, receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1) is involved in PKC-mediated signal transduction. A postnatal developmental increase in RACK1 levels indicates their significance in the outgrowth of neuronal processes. In a physiological model of impairment in PKC translocation-the aged rat brain cortex-RACK1 levels are reduced and the PKC isoenzymes known to interact with it do not translocate to membrane compartments upon stimulation. Anchoring proteins might represent new targets for compounds that modulate PKC signal transduction processes.","Calcium influx through ion channels located on the release face of the presynaptic nerve terminal gates the release of neurotransmitters by the fusion of the secretory vesicle and the discharge of its contents. Recently, several lines of research have indicated that the relationship between the Ca2+ channel and the release site might be more complex than dictated simply by its role as an ion conduit. The evidence suggests that the channel and the transmitter-release mechanism exist as a multimolecular entity and that this interaction has functional consequences, not only on the mechanisms and properties of transmitter release, but also on the behavior of the presynaptic Ca2+ channel itself.","We have studied T-cell apoptosis in animal models of human autoimmune disorders of the nervous system and in other tissues devoid of specialized immune-defense mechanisms. Our data suggest that the CNS has high potential for elimination of T-cell-dependent inflammation, whereas this mechanism is less effective in the PNS, and is almost absent in other tissues such as muscle and skin. Interestingly, several conventional and novel immunotherapeutic approaches, such as glucocorticosteroid and high-dose antigen therapy, induce T-cell apoptosis in situ. In vitro experiments suggest different scenarios for the mechanisms by which specific cellular and humoral elements in the nervous system synergize and sensitize T cells for apoptosis in vivo. We also discuss regulatory, proapoptotic mechanisms, such as the Fas-FasL system and galectin-I, that have been utilized in other tissues to mediate immune protection.","Few concepts have meant more to neuroscience than the synapse, commonly understood to mean the junction between two excitable cells. The term was introduced by Charles Sherrington in 1897. The centenary of this event is an appropriate time to review the term's origins and utility. There are some surprises. The term didn't actually come from him. His concept was more functional than structural. The pioneering physiological and structural studies in the 1950s in fact did not lead to a rigorous definition. There is still confusion on how to define neurotransmitters. As molecular biological approaches are increasingly refining the concept of a fundamental synaptic unit, many types of neuronal interactions are appearing that do not fit with the synaptic concept. Are the neural circuits underlying behaviour strictly synaptic? In dealing with these questions, a longer perspective is useful for understanding how the term arose, how it has evolved to the present, and what kinds of challenges may be coming in the future.","According to many theories of brain function, the computational power of the brain depends upon the number of independent synapses it contains. A synapse will not be independent if its receptors are activated or modified by neurotransmitter released at neighbouring synapses. Recently, there have been several reports suggesting the occurrence of 'crosstalk' or 'spillover', and a large number of results consistent with crosstalk. However, the quantitative importance of this phenomenon remains uncertain. We estimate the significance of crosstalk using a simple model which predicts that, during concentrated synaptic activity, crosstalk between distinct synapses is likely to activate high-affinity receptors and may also desensitize certain receptors. Comparison of these predictions with the experimental data highlights the information that is required for a more detailed model of crosstalk.",,,,,"Research into the biological bases of human intelligence differences is surveyed. Work on brain event-related potentials (ERPs) suggests that people with high IQ test scores: (1) show faster responses in some test conditions; (2) have ERP waveforms that can be distinguished from those of people with lower IQs; and (3) might have less variability in their ERPs. People with higher psychometric intelligence have, on average, larger brains, and possibly faster neural conduction speed. A few small functional brain-scanning studies suggest that, in healthy individuals, people who are of higher IQ have lower cerebral metabolic rates during mentally active conditions. This has led to the speculation that brighter people have more efficient brains. Despite some well-replicated findings in the search for the 'biology of human intelligence' there is a dearth of explanatory accounts to link cognitive performance differences with variance in brain mechanisms.","It is now clear that cytokines traditionally viewed as immune modulators participate in inflammatory responses within the adult nervous system. However, in the developing nervous system hematolymphopoietic cytokines also play a role unrelated to neural-immune interactions. Instead, many of these factors subserve primary regulatory functions related both to the morphogenesis and to the cellular maturation of the central and peripheral nervous systems. This article focuses specifically on cytokine actions in neural development.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Feb;21(2):63.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Apr;21(4):145; author reply 146-7.

As it is one of the major trophic factors in the circulation, its actions in peripheral tissues are well established. It has been used for the treatment of several diseases, including growth deficiency, osteoporosis, catabolic disorders and diabetes. Recent evidence supports the significance of IGF-I in the maintenance of the integrity and homeostasis of the nervous system. The widespread distribution of its receptor allows IGF-I to affect the survival of numerous populations of neurones and glial cells in both the CNS and the PNS. Most recently, a clinical trial has revealed the beneficial effects of IGF-I in amyotrophic lateral-sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative disease of the motoneurones. We review briefly here experimental and clinical information that suggests the potential usefulness of IGF-I in the treatment of certain neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Alzheimer's disease, various neuropathies and brain trauma. The rather unique propensity of IGF-I to act on a variety of neuronal cells might provide a general means of reducing or slowing down neuronal losses that occur following various brain insults.",,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a rapidly expanding subclass of the transforming growth factor superfamily. BMP ligands and receptor subunits are present throughout neural development within discrete regions of the embryonic brain and within neural crest-derived pre- and post-migratory zones. BMPs initially inhibit the formation of neuroectoderm during gastrulation while, within the neural tube, they act as gradient morphogens to promote the differentiation of dorsal cell types and intermediate cell types throughout co-operative signaling. In the peripheral nervous system, BMPs act as instructive signals for neuronal lineage commitment and promote graded stages of neuronal differentiation. By contrast, within the CNS, these same factors promote astroglial lineage elaboration from embryonic subventricular zone progenitor cells, with concurrent suppression of the neuronal or oligodendroglial lineages, or both. In addition, BMPs act on more lineage-restricted embryonic CNS progenitor cells to promote regional neuronal survival and cellular differentiation. Furthermore, these versatile cytokines induce selective apoptosis of discrete rhombencephalic neural crest-associated cellular populations. These observations suggest that the BMPs exhibit a broad range of cellular and context-specific effects during multiple stages of neural development.",Interfaces between glial cell precursors of the PNS and CNS are established early in development and form the sites where sensory axons enter and motor axons exit the developing CNS. The molecular and cellular interactions that lead to the formation of these glial interfaces are only now becoming apparent. New in-vitro techniques are providing clues as to how the maturation of PNS-CNS glial interfaces generates barriers to regenerating axons.,Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Feb;21(2):63-4.,"The Y-receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and mediate a wide variety of physiological effects, such as regulation of blood pressure, anxiety, memory retention, hormone release and food intake. Since the first human Y-receptor was cloned in 1992, the search for additional subtypes has been an area of intense study. Recently four new NPY-receptor subtypes have been isolated, revealing surprisingly limited sequence identity with values as low as 30%. Several reports indicate further heterogeneity of this receptor family, for example a peripheral Y2 receptor. However, since many studies have been carried out with different peptide analogs and radioligands in different species, there is substantial confusion regarding the pharmacological profile of the receptors. This may have led to an exaggeration of the potential number of discrete receptors.","The ongoing dissection of the roles of p75NTR and TrkA, -B and -C in neurotrophin signaling has generated a number of apparent paradoxes. Limiting consideration to the role of p75NTR in cell death, a theory is proposed that is based on the following postulates: (1) that p75NTR displays a pro-apoptotic intrinsic (ligand-independent, Trk-independent) receptor effect (IRE), which is inhibited by ligand binding; (2) that p75NTR and TrkA exhibit mutual repression of signaling; and (3) that p75NTR and TrkA are required for the efficient generation of high-affinity NGF binding sites.","Techniques for measuring exocytosis, endocytosis and vesicle cycling in living cells in real time have resulted in a rapid expansion in the knowledge of these processes in neurons and other secretory cells. Several experimental approaches, developed during the past decade, have played key roles in this expansion. In this review we focus on three techniques: electrophysiological methods for monitoring membrane capacitance, electrochemical methods for detecting released secretory contents and optical methods for imaging membranes of endosomes and recycled vesicles that are stained with fluorescent dyes. Each technique has contributed unique and complementary information about the vesicle cycle, advancing our knowledge of the kinetics of membrane fusion and retrieval, the identity of the secretory contents and the spatial patterns and directional pathways involved in secretory membrane recycling. Naturally, each technique has inherent limitations; some of these shortcomings have recently been resolved by using more than one method simultaneously.",,,"The early appearance of monoamine systems in the developing mammalian CNS suggests that they play a role in neural development. We review data from two model systems that provide compelling new evidence of this role. In one model system-in utero exposure to cocaine-specific and robust alterations are seen in dopamine-rich areas of the cerebral cortex, such as the anterior cingulate cortex: D1 receptor-G protein coupling is greatly reduced, the GABAergic system is altered and pyramidal dendrites undergo excessive growth. In a second model system-a transgenic mouse line in which the gene that encodes monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is disrupted, resulting in excessively high 5-HT levels-barrels fail to form in the developing somatosensory cortex. Both models reveal the effects of very early manipulation of monoamines on forebrain development, and the long-term anomalies that persist into adulthood.","The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a tiny, amorphous structure located beneath the postsynaptic membrane of synapses in the CNS. Until recently, the molecular composition and function of the PSD were mostly matters of speculation. With the advent of powerful new microchemical tools and molecular-genetic methods, three new classes of proteins have been identified in the PSD at glutamatergic synapses: the PSD-95 family, the NR2B subunit of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, and densin-180. The PSD-95 family is involved in clustering of NMDA receptors. NR2B is phosphorylated by Ca2(+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II, a prominent constituent of the PSD. Densin-180 might represent a new class of synaptic adhesion molecule. Study of these molecules is beginning to reveal the functional significance of the PSD.","Understanding the cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in building the brain remains one of the most challenging problems of neurobiology. In this article, we review recent work on the developmental mechanisms that generate the embryonic brain in insects. We compare some of the early developmental events that occur in the insect brain with those that operate during brain development in vertebrates and find that numerous parallels are present at both the cellular and the molecular levels. Thus, the roles of glial cells in prefiguring axon pathways, the function of pioneer neurons in establishing axon pathways, and the formation of a primary axon scaffolding are features of embryonic brain development in both insects and vertebrates. Moreover, at the molecular genetic level homologous regulatory genes control morphogenesis, regionalization and patterning during embryonic brain development in both insects and vertebrates. This indicates that there might be universal mechanisms for brain development, and that knowledge gained from Drosophila and other insects is relevant to our understanding of brain development in other more complex organisms, including man.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1998 Mar;21(3):106.,"Appetitive learning of food-predicting stimuli, an essential part of foraging behavior in honeybees, follows the rules of associative learning. In the learning of odors as reward-predicting stimuli, an individual neuron, one of a small group of large ascending neurons that serve principal brain neuropiles, mediates the reward and has experience-dependent response properties. This implies that this neuron functions as an integral part of associative memory, might underlie more complex features of learning, and could participate in the implementation of learning rules. Moreover, its structural properties suggest that it organizes the interaction of functionally different neural nets during learning and experience-dependent behavior.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Dec;20(12):559.,"Separate nervous systems, somatic and autonomic, were proposed to regulate the portion of the individual's life that is concerned with the external environment and the portion that is concerned with internal homeostasis. Regulation of the autonomic system by the CNS was assigned to the limbic system. Brainstem circuitry, between limbic and autonomic systems, was assigned to the supposedly nonspecific reticular formation. In fact, daily survival depends on integrated control of behavior and internal physiology. In mammals only the brain has the inbuilt programming for patterned co-ordination of these activities. The terms autonomic nervous system, limbic system and reticular formation are at odds with this patterned co-ordination. They should be abandoned and replaced with the term visceral neurons (afferent and efferent) and with reference to relevant specific-neural circuitry in the brain.","Axon interruption elicits a complex neuronal response that leaves neurons poised precariously between death and regeneration. The signals underlying this dichotomy are not fully understood. The transcription factor c-Jun is one of the earliest and most consistent markers for neurons that respond to nerve-fiber transection, and its expression can be related to both degeneration and survival including target re-innervation. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that expression of c-Jun can kill neonatal neurons but, in the adult nervous system, c-Jun might also be involved in neuroprotection and regeneration. The functional characteristics of c-Jun offer a model for the ability of a single molecule to serve as pivotal regulator for death or survival, not only in the response of the cell body to axonal lesions but also following neurodegenerative disorders. In this model, the fate of neurons is determined by a novel transcriptional network comprising c-Jun, ATF-2 (activating transcription factor-2) and JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases).","The fast, tightly regulated release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve terminals is effected by a complex molecular apparatus. The precise roles of the various proteins involved remain largely conjectural. Cysteine string proteins (CSPs) are novel synaptic vesicle components that have been conserved in evolution. They are characterized by an N-terminus 'J'-domain and a central, multiply palmitoylated string of cysteine residues. Vertebrate CSPs have been implicated in a functional interaction of synaptic vesicles with presynaptic Ca2+ channels. Genetic 'knockout' of CSPs in Drosophila results in a temperature-sensitive breakdown of elicited transmitter release. Here we try to integrate these observations into speculative functional models on the role of this new protein family in synaptic vesicle exocytosis.","Partial removal of layer-specific afferents of the hippocampus is said to induce sprouting of intact fibers from neighboring layers that invade the zone of the degenerating axons. However, recent in vivo and in vitro studies using sensitive anterograde tracers have failed to demonstrate sprouting across laminar boundaries. Sprouting does occur; but, it mainly involves unlesioned fiber systems terminating within the layer of fiber degeneration in addition to the degenerating afferents. These findings point to rigid laminar cues attracting certain fiber systems while repelling others in normal development and after partial deafferentation.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Dec;20(12):557-8.,"Activation of presynaptic receptors for a variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators inhibits transmitter release at many synapses. Such presynaptic inhibition might serve as a means of adjusting synaptic strength or preventing excessive transmitter release, or both. Previous evidence showed that presynaptic modulators inhibit Ca2+ channels and activate K+ channels at neuronal somata. These modulators also inhibit spontaneous transmitter release by mechanisms downstream of Ca2+ entry. The relative contribution of the above mechanisms to the inhibition of elicited release has been debated for a long time. Recent evidence at synapses where the relationship between transmitter release and presynaptic Ca2+ influx has been well characterized suggests that inhibition of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels plays the major role in presynaptic inhibition of elicited neurotransmitter release. In addition, modulation of the release machinery might contribute to inhibition of elicited release.","Neocortical and hippocampal GABA-containing interneurons are susceptible to activity-dependent modulation, such as regulation of soma size, numbers of synaptic contacts, and levels of GABA or neuropeptide expression. In vitro, the effects of neuronal activity on morphology and gene expression of GABA-containing neurons are mimicked, in part, by members of the neurotrophin gene family, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In the neocortex and hippocampus, BDNF is synthesized and secreted in an activity-dependent manner by pyramidal neurons, the target cells of GABA-containing neurons, suggesting that BDNF is an activity-dependent, target-derived trophic factor for these interneurons. In support of this, neuronal activity fails to upregulate the expression of neuropeptide Y in hippocampal cultures from BDNF-deficient mice. We, therefore, hypothesize that neurotrophins might mediate some of the actions of neuronal activity on GABA-containing neurons.","A wide variety of techniques have been employed for the detection and measurement of neurotransmitter release from biological preparations. Whilst many of these methods offer impressive levels of sensitivity, few are able to combine sensitivity with the necessary temporal and spatial resolution required to study quantal release from single cells. One detection method that is seeing a revival of interest and has the potential to fill this niche is the so-called 'sniffer-patch' technique. In this article, specific examples of the practical aspects of using this technique are discussed along with the procedures involved in calibrating these biosensors to extend their applications to provide quantitative, in addition to simple qualitative, measurements of quantal transmitter release.",,"There is increasing evidence that, in addition to its major functional role in the regulation of fine motor control, the cerebellum is involved in other important functions, such as sensory-motor learning and memory. Classical conditioning of the eyeblink or nictitating membrane response (and other discrete behavioral responses) is a form of sensory-motor learning that depends crucially upon the cerebellum. Within the cerebellum, however, the relative importance of the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei in eyeblink conditioning is unclear and disputed. Recent studies employing various mutant mice provide an effective approach to resolving this controversy. Eyeblink conditioning in spontaneous mutant mice deficit in Purkinje cells, the exclusive output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, indicate that both the cerebellar cortex and the interpositus nucleus are important. Furthermore, studies involving gene knockout mice suggest that long-term depression, a process of synaptic plasticity occurring in Purkinje cells, might be involved in eyeblink conditioning.","Recently there have been exciting advances in understanding the mechanisms and functional roles of a form of short-term synaptic enhancement (STE) that results from an activity-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal. This form of STE is composed of at least four processes: fast-decaying facilitation (FI), slow-decaying facilitation (F2), augmentation (AUG) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Recent results suggest that these processes can now be distinguished mechanistically by the site of their induction within the presynaptic terminal: FI and F2 appear to be induced by a rapid, high concentration of Ca2+ at or near the site of exocytosis, whereas AUG and PTP seem to be induced by lower levels of Ca2+ with slower kinetics, possibly within the core of the terminal. STE is highly conserved across diverse species, and appears to serve as a flexible mechanism for temporal information processing in systems ranging from peripheral motor control to higher cortical integration.","Albino mammals have specific deficits in their retinae and in the pattern of decussation at their optic chiasm, demonstrating that a melanin-related agent is crucial for normal development of the visual system. Although much attention has been paid to chiasmatic abnormality over the past 30 years, little progress has been made in understanding the abnormality. There has now been a shift of attention towards an analysis of the developing albino retina, which is providing significant advances in our understanding of the role played by this melanin-related agent. It is now possible to identify one candidate substance that emanates from the synthetic pathway of melanin that plays a key role in regulating retinal development.","Several neurotrophins and their receptors regulate the survival of vestibular and cochlear neurons and probably also the efferent and autonomic neurons that innervate the inner ear. Mice lacking either brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or its associated receptor, TrkB, lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have reduced innervation of the outer hair cells in the apical and middle turns of the cochlea. Mice lacking neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or its receptor, TrkC, lose many spiral ganglion cells predominantly in the basal turn of the cochlea. Nerve fibers from spiral ganglion cells in the middle turn extended to inner hair cells of the base. In mice lacking both BDNF and NT-3, or both TrkB and TrkC, there is a complete loss of innervation to the inner ear. Thus, these two neurotrophins and their associated receptors have been shown to be absolutely necessary for the normal development of afferent innervation of the inner ear. Current research efforts are testing the therapeutic potential for neurotrophins to treat hearing loss.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Dec;20(12):558-9., ,"Developmental dyslexics often complain that small letters appear to blur and move around when they are trying to read. Anatomical, electrophysiological, psychophysical and brain-imaging studies have all contributed to elucidating the functional organization of these and other visual confusions. They emerge not from damage to a single visual relay but from abnormalities of the magnocellular component of the visual system, which is specialized for processing fast temporal information. The m-stream culminates in the posterior parietal cortex, which plays an important role in guiding visual attention. The evidence is consistent with an increasingly sophisticated account of dyslexia that does not single out either phonological, or visual or motor deficits. Rather, temporal processing in all three systems seems to be impaired. Dyslexics may be unable to process fast incoming sensory information adequately in any domain.","Ion channels render nerve and muscle excitable. A typical channel protein can mediate the passive transfer of millions of ions per second across the membrane. Thus, channels catalyse the transmembrane flux of ions, fulfilling criteria traditionally associated with enzymes. Is this a semantic coincidence, or do channels and enzymes in fact rely upon similar structural principles? A general answer remains elusive given the paucity of crystallographic data on channels. Nevertheless, emerging evidence points to fundamental similarities between the pores of channels and the active sites of enzymes of resolved structure. Shared features include narrow clefts lined by protein loops, and specific binding of transition intermediates during catalysis. The often cited analogies between channels and enzymes might therefore reflect basic design homologies.","There is increasing evidence that nitric oxide (NO), a free radical that can act both as a signaling molecule and a neurotoxin, is involved in the mechanisms of cerebral ischemia. Although early investigations yielded conflicting results, the introduction of more-selective pharmacological tools and the use of molecular approaches for deletion of genes encoding for NO synthase have provided a better understanding of the role of NO in the mechanisms of ischemic brain damage. The evidence reviewed in this article suggests that NO is protective or destructive depending on the stage of evolution of the ischemic process and on the cellular source of NO. Defining the role of NO in cerebral ischemia provides the rationale for new neuroprotective strategies based on modulation of NO production in the post-ischemic brain.","Most neurons in the mammalian CNS encode and transmit information via action potentials. Knowledge of where these electrical events are initiated and how they propagate within neurons is therefore fundamental to an understanding of neuronal function. While work from the 1950s suggested that action potentials are initiated in the axon, many subsequent investigations have suggested that action potentials can also be initiated in the dendrites. Recently, experiments using simultaneous patch-pipette recordings from different locations on the same neuron have been used to address this issue directly. These studies show that the site of action potential initiation is in the axon, even when synaptic activation is powerful enough to elicit dendritic electrogenesis. Furthermore, these and other studies also show that following initiation, action potentials actively backpropagate into the dendrites of many neuronal types, providing a retrograde signal of neuronal output to the dendritic tree.","Respiration is a rhythmic motor behavior that appears in the fetus and acquires a vital importance at birth. It is generated centrally, within neuronal networks of the hindbrain. This region of the brain is of particular interest since it is the best understood with respect to the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie its development. Examination of hindbrain activities in the chick embryo has revealed that the central rhythm generator is active before fetal maturation and conforms to the rhombomeric organization of the embryonic hindbrain. Inactivation of genes required for the normal formation of rhombomeres in mice leads to perturbations of the reticular formation that affect respiration after birth and compromise the probability of survival. From studies of hindbrain development we might gain an understanding of how genes govern the early embryonic development of neuronal networks and how this might specify patterns of motor activities operating throughout life.","In 1994, TINS published a brief analysis of the problems faced by the European neuroscience community in its attempt to meet the challenges associated with the proclamation of the European 'Decade of the Brain'. Since then numerous initiatives have been taken by national and European neuroscience societies with the common goals of improving communication among European neuroscientists, increasing the visibility of the neurosciences as an autonomous and increasingly important domain of research in the appreciation of national and European granting bodies, and facilitating integration of colleagues from Eastern Europe into the international scientific community. These initiatives have led to major changes in the organization and self-apprehension of national and European neuroscience societies.","In 1891, Luigi Luciani published his famous monograph on the cerebellum and formulated his triad of the cerebellar symptoms: atonia, asthenia and astasia, which explained all troubles provoked by cerebellar lesions; later he added a fourth sign, dysmetria. In spite of the fact that it was advanced in a pre-electrophysiological period, Luciani's interpretation of the cerebellar role in many motor functions survives more than a century later and his terminology has entered the routine of the neurological examination. With the modern knowledge of cerebellar circuitries, we can state that Luciani rightly pointed out the role of the cerebellum in regulating postural tone and muscular force, and that conversely he was wrong in denying cerebellar influence in co-ordination of multi-joint movements and the somatotopic localizations in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. In spite of this, Luciani's work represents a milestone in cerebellar physiology.","How the brain generates visual percepts is a central problem in neuroscience. We propose a detailed neural model of how lateral geniculate nuclei and the interblob cortical stream through V1 and V2 generate context-sensitive perceptual groupings from visual inputs. The model suggests a functional role for cortical layers, columns, maps and networks, and proposes homologous circuits for V1 and V2 with larger-scale processing in V2. An integrated treatment of interlaminar, horizontal, orientational and endstopping cortical interactions and a role for corticogeniculate feedback in grouping are proposed. Modeled circuits simulate parametric psychophysical data about boundary grouping and illusory contour formation.","The use of genetically engineered mice has been a major development in neuroscience research. Genetic engineering is an undoubtedly powerful technique; however, the value of this approach has been debated, particularly in relation to its use to probe the underlying bases of complex behaviors, such as memory. A recent new development of the technique is the ability to target a specific gene knockout to a particular subregion or even to specific and limited cell types of the mouse brain. An example of this approach is the knockout of the NMDARI gene in only CAI-pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. The resulting animals can be tested by several methods, including in vivo multielectrode recording during behavioral tasks. The data provide strong evidence in favor of the notion that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity at CAI synapses is required for both the acquisition of spatial memory and the formation of normal CAI place fields. This relationship suggests that robust place fields may be essential for spatial memory.",,,"Nicotinic ACh (nACh) receptors in the CNS are composed of a diverse array of subunits and have a range of pharmacological properties. However, despite the fact that they are ligand-gated cation channels, their physiological functions have not been determined. This has led to increased interest in presynaptic nACh receptors that act to modulate the release of transmitter from presynaptic terminals.","Several lines of investigation have helped clarify the role of GAP-43 (FI, B-50 or neuromodulin) in regulating the growth state of axon terminals. In transgenic mice, overexpression of GAP-43 leads to the spontaneous formation of new synapses and enhanced sprouting after injury. Null mutation of the GAP-43 gene disrupts axonal pathfinding and is generally lethal shortly after birth. Manipulations of GAP-43 expression likewise have profound effects on neurite outgrowth for cells in culture. GAP-43 appears to be involved in transducing intra- and extracellular signals to regulate cytoskeletal organization in the nerve ending. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C is particularly significant in this regard, and is linked with both nerve-terminal sprouting and long-term potentiation. In the brains of humans and other primates, high levels of GAP-43 persist in neocortical association areas and in the limbic system throughout life, where the protein might play an important role in mediating experience-dependent plasticity.","Integration of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response occurs by way of interactions between stress-sensitive brain circuitry and neuroendocrine neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Stressors involving an immediate physiologic threat ('systemic' stressors) are relayed directly to the PVN, probably via brainstem catecholaminergic projections. By contrast, stressors requiring interpretation by higher brain structures ('processive' stressors) appear to be channeled through limbic forebrain circuits. Forebrain limbic sites connect with the PVN via interactions with GABA-containing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area and hypothalamus. Thus, final elaboration of processive stress responses is likely to involve modulation of PVN GABAergic tone. The functional and neuroanatomical data obtained suggest that disease processes involving inappropriate stress control involve dysfunction of processive stress pathways.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Aug;20(8):346-7.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive dementia characterized in part by deposition of proteinaceous plaques in various areas of the brain. The main plaque protein component is beta-amyloid, a metabolic product of the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Substantial evidence has implicated beta-amyloid (and other amyloidogenic fragments of the precursor protein) with the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, beta-amyloid precursor protein and its amyloidogenic metabolic fragments have been shown to alter cellular ionic activity, either through interaction with existing channels or by de novo channel formation. Such alteration in ionic homeostasis has also been linked with cellular toxicity and might provide a molecular mechanism underlying the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer's disease.","Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the first therapeutic intervention shown to alter the natural history of multiple sclerosis (MS), a relapsing then progressive inflammatory degenerative disease of the CNS. Since publication of the first randomized placebo-controlled trial of IFN-beta, and subsequent acquisition of US and European product licences for use in relapsing-remitting MS, the hopes and expectations of patients have been elevated greatly only to be dampened as more critical analysis of the trial results, in conjunction with the cost of treatment, led to marked limitations on prescription in several countries. IFN-beta is not a cure. Here we review what is known about the mechanisms of action of IFN-beta in demyelinating disease, and propose a possible model of action of IFN-beta in the treatment of MS.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Aug;20(8):343-4; author reply 345-6.

Trends Neurosci. 1997 Aug;20(8):344; author reply 345-6.,,,"The mammalian cerebral cortex generates a variety of rhythmic oscillations, detectable directly from the cortex or the scalp. Recent non-invasive recordings from intact humans, by means of neuromagnetometers with large sensor arrays, have shown that several regions of the healthy human cortex have their own intrinsic rhythms, typically 8-40 Hz in frequency, with modality- and frequency-specific reactivity. The conventional hypotheses about the functional significance of brain rhythms extend from epiphenomena to perceptual binding and object segmentation. Recent data indicate that some cortical rhythms can be related to periodic activity of peripheral sensor and effector organs.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Jun;20(6):244.,"Antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia have in common the property of being dopamine-receptor antagonists. However, the rapid timecourse of receptor blockade produced upon drug administration does not correlate with the emergence of clinical actions, which typically require weeks of treatment to become manifest. Studies in rats have shown that repeated antipsychotic drug treatment results in a delayed inactivation of dopamine-neuron firing in the midbrain due to depolarization block. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in humans correlates with their ability to induce depolarization block of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, whereas their potential to produce extrapyramidal side effects correlates with their propensity for inducing depolarization block in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Therefore, dopamine-cell depolarization block is an effective model for evaluating antipsychotic drug efficacy, and provides a potential mechanism to account for their therapeutic impact on a dysregulated dopamine system.","The peripheral nervous system is created by a spatiotemporally co-ordinated migratory process during which the precursor cells, the neural crest (NC) cells, transverse the embryo to reach distantly located sites. Original transplantation experiments implicated the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a pivotal factor in the regulation of this process, and subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies have uncovered a number of ECM molecules potentially responsible for the NC cell-ECM interaction. Recent genetic manipulations in mice sustain the importance of certain matrix constituents, while precluding a significant role for others and, surprisingly, for all primary integrin receptors expressed by NC cells. The gradually crystallizing paradigm envisions that guidance of the disseminating NC cells, as well as the arrest at their final tissue locations, is governed by specific 'inhibitory' ECM-associated signals. This implies that homing of peripheral neurons and their supportive cells might be dictated by a delicate equilibrium between the multiple actions of stimulatory and inhibitory molecules, which is modulated further by defined responses of the dispersing cells to these ECM components during their successive phases of phenotypic diversification.", ,"The neuromuscular junction is the site of several myasthenic (mys, muscle; aesthenia, weakness) disorders of autoimmune and genetic origin. The acquired autoimmune conditions are mainly adult-onset and caused by antibodies to specific neuronal and muscle ion channels, but can occur neonatally due to placental transfer of maternal antibodies. This review focuses on the rarer genetic conditions, called congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), that often present at birth. Mutations have yet to be characterized for familial infantile myasthenia, acetylcholinesterase deficiency and ACh-receptor deficiency; but genes encoding both structural and functional NMJ protiens should be considered. Other syndromes have recently been shown to involve defects in the functioning of the ACh receptor itself. In particular, eight different mutations have been reported in cases of the slow channel syndrome, a dominant condition associated with point mutations that generate single amino acid changes within the ACh receptor and result in prolonged channel activations. These investigations are providing new insights into the structure and function of the ACh receptor. Further studies of CMS should pave the way for analysis and treatment of disorders involving other synapses in the peripheral and central nervous system.","The resemblance between the Drosophila EAG current and the mammalian M-current is very strong, but final confirmation for a member of the extended EAG family encoding the M-current remains to be determined.",Comment in Trends Neurosci. 1997 Jun;20(6):243-4.,"Glutamic acid is an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. It has been established that synaptic transmission is mediated mostly by the ionotropic glutamate receptors AMPA and NMDA, with fast and slow kinetics, respectively. The recent demonstration in hippocampal neurones of a class of glutamate receptors that are activated by kainate and not by AMPA (that is, kainate-selective receptors) opens the possibility that receptors, others than those of the AMPA type, might also be involved in fast neurotransmission. The lack of specific pharmacological tools to dissect out AMPA from kainate receptors has hampered the functional study of kainate receptors. However, the recent finding that a 2,3-benzodiazepine (GYK153655) behaves as a selective antagonist of AMPA receptors allows us to address the question of the role of rapidly inactivating kainate receptors in synaptic transmission.",Systematic genetic screens have been powerful tools in identifying genes responsible for axon guidance in fruitflies and nematodes. This approach has now been extended to the study of axon guidance and the formation of topographic neuronal connections in the vertebrate brain. A systematic genetic screen was used to identify genes responsible for precise axon pathfinding and targeting in the retinotectal system of the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Over 30 genes were found that affect either: (1) retinal axon pathfinding to the contralateral tectal lobe; or (2) the topographic connection between the eye and the tectum. The zebrafish retinotectal mutants represent a new resource for the study of axon guidance in the vertebrate brain.,DOI: 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)30017-9 PMID: 9004409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]
